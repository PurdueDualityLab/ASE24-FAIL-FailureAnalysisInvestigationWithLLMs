The incidents were attributed to poor password management, unencrypted communications, and basic security hygiene issues introduced during system development. For example, testers were able to guess admin passwords on weapons systems in seconds, take control of systems, and manipulate them due to vulnerabilities originating from poor basic password security or lack of encryption [76390, 76430].

(b) Additionally, the software failure incidents were also linked to the operation phase, where vulnerabilities were exploited due to the operation or misuse of the systems. Testers were able to gain initial access and full control of weapons systems within a short period, highlighting the operational weaknesses that allowed for such breaches to occur. The report also mentioned that intrusion detection systems were not effectively identifying and alerting operators to potential attacks, leading to desensitization to warnings and making the systems vulnerable during operation [76390, 76430].","(a) The software failure incident reported in the articles is primarily within the system. The failures were due to vulnerabilities and weaknesses originating from within the Department of Defense's weapons systems themselves. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) report highlighted that testers were able to exploit mission-critical cyber vulnerabilities within the weapons systems, such as poor password management, unencrypted communications, default passwords, and lack of encryption [76390, 76430]. Testers were able to take control of systems, operate undetected, and even shut down weapons systems by scanning them, indicating that the failures were internal to the systems [76390, 76430].

(b) Additionally, the software failure incident can also be attributed to factors outside the system. The articles mention that the vulnerabilities were exploited by authorized hackers who were able to seize control of weapons systems being acquired by the American military. The hackers were able to penetrate the systems through easy-to-crack passwords and because the systems had few protections against insiders working on the programs [76430]. This external factor of authorized hackers targeting the systems from outside contributed to the software failure incident.","(a) The articles report on a software failure incident related to non-human actions. The failure was due to vulnerabilities in weapons systems that were exploited by authorized hackers during penetration tests conducted by the Department of Defense [76390, 76430]. These vulnerabilities included poor password management, unencrypted communications, default passwords not being changed, and lack of encryption, which allowed testers to take control of systems and operate undetected [76390]. Additionally, the testers were able to gain access to weapons systems within a short period of time, highlighting the ease with which these systems could be compromised [76390]. The report also mentioned that the vulnerabilities were not limited to cyber threats but also included physical manipulation of the systems, such as causing pop-up messages on users' terminals [76430].

(b) The articles also indicate that human actions played a role in the software failure incident. The report highlighted that program officials within the Department of Defense believed their systems were secure and discounted some test results as unrealistic, despite routine findings of mission-critical cyber vulnerabilities during testing [76390]. There were instances where testers were able to exploit vulnerabilities due to easy-to-crack passwords or lack of protections against insiders working on the programs [76430]. The lack of prioritization of weapon systems cybersecurity in the past by the Defense Department and the failure to fully grasp the vulnerabilities introduced by millions of lines of software in parts and subsystems also contributed to the software failure incident [76430].","(a) The articles do not provide information about a software failure incident occurring due to contributing factors that originate in hardware.

(b) The software failure incident reported in the articles is primarily due to contributing factors that originate in software. The incidents involve significant vulnerabilities in the Department of Defense's weapons systems, such as poor password management, unencrypted communications, default passwords not being changed, and lack of encryption [76390]. Testers were able to take control of systems, operate undetected, and even shut down weapons systems by scanning them [76390]. The vulnerabilities were exploited through software-related weaknesses, highlighting the critical importance of cybersecurity in software design and implementation.","(a) The software failure incident reported in the articles is malicious in nature. The incidents described in the articles involve authorized hackers being able to seize control of weapons systems being acquired by the American military, highlighting vulnerabilities that could be exploited by adversaries. Test teams were able to take control of operators' terminals, manipulate systems, and cause disruptions, such as displaying pop-up messages instructing users to insert coins to continue operating. These actions were part of penetration tests conducted by the Government Accountability Office, revealing serious weaknesses in the systems that could be exploited by malicious actors [Article 76390, Article 76430].","(a) The software failure incident reported in the articles is related to poor decisions made in the Department of Defense (DOD) regarding cybersecurity vulnerabilities in its weapons systems. The articles highlight that the DOD remains in denial about cybersecurity threats to its weapons systems despite the presence of critical cyber vulnerabilities. The failures were attributed to basic issues such as poor password management, unencrypted communications, and failure to change default passwords on weapons systems [76390, 76430].

(b) The software failure incident can also be attributed to accidental decisions or unintended mistakes made by the DOD officials overseeing the weapons systems. The articles mention that testers were able to exploit vulnerabilities in the systems due to poor basic security hygiene, such as easily guessable admin passwords and lack of encryption. Additionally, the DOD officials discounted some test results as unrealistic, indicating a lack of awareness or understanding of the actual cybersecurity risks present in the systems [76390, 76430].","(a) The articles highlight software failure incidents related to development incompetence. The incidents occurred due to poor password management, unencrypted communications, default passwords not being changed, and lack of encryption [76390]. Testers were able to gain control of weapons systems by guessing admin passwords in seconds, partially shutting down systems by scanning them, and taking full control of systems within hours [76390]. The report by the Government Accountability Office revealed that many weapons systems could be neutralized within hours, with testers easily seizing control of operators' terminals and manipulating systems due to vulnerabilities introduced during development [76430].

(b) The software failure incidents were accidental in nature as they were not intentional but rather resulted from vulnerabilities introduced during the development and testing phases. The weaknesses in the systems were not deliberately created but were due to poor cybersecurity practices, lack of awareness, and oversight by the Department of Defense [76390, 76430]. The incidents were not planned but rather a result of inadequate security measures and a lack of understanding of cybersecurity risks in weapon systems development.","The software failure incident described in the articles can be categorized as both permanent and temporary:

(a) Permanent: The software failure incident can be considered permanent as the vulnerabilities in the weapons systems identified by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) were fundamental and systemic, indicating a long-standing issue within the Department of Defense (DOD). The report highlighted that almost all weapons tested between 2012 and 2017 had ""mission critical"" cyber vulnerabilities, with poor password management and unencrypted communications being cited as basic issues contributing to the vulnerabilities [76390]. Additionally, the report mentioned that the DOD had a hard time detecting when testers were probing the weapons, with testers being able to gain full control of systems and operate undetected for extended periods [76390].

(b) Temporary: The software failure incident can also be considered temporary as the vulnerabilities were identified during specific testing periods and assessments conducted by the DOD. The GAO report mentioned that testers were able to exploit vulnerabilities in weapons systems during testing, indicating that the failures were due to specific circumstances related to the testing environment and methodologies [76390]. Furthermore, the report highlighted that the DOD's track record for fixing vulnerabilities identified in-house was not satisfactory, with only one out of 20 cyber vulnerabilities being fixed during the time period covered by the report [76390]. This suggests that the failures were temporary in the sense that they were identified within a specific timeframe but not adequately addressed.","(a) The failed system was intended to support the information industry. The software failure incident reported in the articles pertains to cybersecurity vulnerabilities in weapons systems of the Department of Defense (DOD) [Article 76390, Article 76430].

The attack targets the infrastructure and operations of the 911 system itself, highlighting vulnerabilities within the system that can be exploited by attackers.","(a) The software failure incident occurring due to non-human actions:
The software failure incident described in the articles is related to a telephony denial-of-service (TDoS) attack on the 911 emergency phone system. This attack involves infecting mobile phones with malware to automatically make bogus 911 calls, thereby overwhelming call-center queues and preventing legitimate callers from reaching operators. The attack is initiated by infecting smartphones, creating a botnet of phones, and sending commands to call 911 repeatedly without the phone owners' knowledge. This non-human action of infecting phones and initiating the attack leads to the disruption of the 911 system [47969].

(b) The software failure incident occurring due to human actions:
The software failure incident also involves human actions as attackers are responsible for launching the TDoS attack by infecting smartphones with malware. The attackers introduce the contributing factors by sending malware through email attachments, text messages, or embedding malicious code in applications to entice users to download them. Additionally, the attackers send commands to the infected phones to make repeated 911 calls, causing the disruption of the emergency system. The human actions of planning and executing the attack play a significant role in the failure of the 911 system [47969].","(a) The software failure incident reported in the articles is primarily related to hardware. The incident involves a potential attack on the 911 emergency system through the use of infected smartphones to create a botnet and overwhelm the system. The attack targets the firmware of the phones, which is the software beneath the operating system that makes the phone work. The malware created by the researchers infects the phone's firmware, allowing the attacker to control the devices and make repeated 911 calls silently in the background without the phone owner's notice [47969].

(b) The software failure incident is also related to software as the attack involves infecting mobile phones with malware to initiate bogus 911 calls. The malware created by the researchers infects the phone's firmware, allowing the attacker to send commands to the infected phones to call 911 repeatedly. The calls are initiated by the firmware and occur silently in the background without the phone owner's knowledge. Additionally, the malware changes the IDs with each call made by the phone to thwart blacklisting, making it difficult to stop the attack [47969].","(a) The software failure incident described in the articles is malicious in nature.
