Report: subs didn't need to be berthed

Within weeks of a deadly fire aboard HMCS Chic-outimi, navy engineers and electrical experts deemed Canada's three other used submarines safe and recommended they be put back to sea, say newly released documents.
But the advice was ignored by senior officers who insisted on further technical improvements and were concerned that even the slightest hiccup would have further vexed the glitch-filled program.
'There were a number of different considerations that had to be weighed,' said Lieut. Diane Grover, a spokeswoman for the commander of the navy, Vice-Admiral Bruce MacLean.
'Ultimately, the decision was one rooted in responsible risk management and personnel safety.'
A defence analyst said keeping the entire fleet sidelined for seven months hurt training in a submarine program that was already behind schedule, but the decision was likely considered a justifiable trade-off.
'I don't think the navy could have ignored the political implications,' said David Rudd, president of the Canadian Institute for Strategic Studies.
'A second accident, even a minor one, in the wake of the Chicoutimi fire would have been dynamite.'
Less than a week after an electrical fire killed one officer and ravaged the inside of Chicoutimi last October, its sister boats, Victoria, Windsor and Corner Brook, were pulled out of service.
Two of the submarines were put back in the water last month after a naval board of inquiry delivered its final report into the accident, which claimed the life of Lieut. Chris Saunders, 32, of Halifax.
But an internal risk assessment, prepared by naval engineers, concluded on Nov. 1, 2004, that there was nothing 'to prevent the safe resumption of operations in Victoria and Windsor.'
The 33-page document, penned by the navy's subsafe board, recommended that 'the current operational pause be rescinded and that Victoria and Windsor resume their scheduled programs.'
The two submarines, acquired from the British in a $891-million lease-to-purchase agreement, were the only ones operational at the time of the fire.
