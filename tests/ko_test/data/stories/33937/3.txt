Keeping sub fleet sidelined for seven months unnecessary: report

HALIFAX (CP) - Within weeks of a deadly fire aboard HMCS Chicoutimi, navy engineers and electrical experts deemed Canada's three other used submarines safe and recommended they be put back to sea, say newly released documents.
But the advice was ignored by senior officers who insisted on further technical improvements and were concerned that even the slightest hiccup would have further vexed the glitch-filled program.
'There were a number of different considerations that had to be weighed,' said Lieut. Diane Grover, a spokeswoman for the commander of the navy, Vice-Admiral Bruce MacLean.
'Ultimately the decision was one rooted in responsible risk management and personnel safety.'
A defence analyst said keeping the entire fleet sidelined for seven months hurt training in a submarine program that was already behind schedule, but the decision was likely considered a justifiable trade-off.
'I don't think the navy could have ignored the political implications,' said David Rudd, president of the Canadian Institute for Strategic Studies.
'A second accident, even a minor one, in the wake of the Chicoutimi fire would have been dynamite. DND had no doubt about the safety and utility of the fleet, but there might have been a lot of people in Parliament that did.'
Less than a week after an electrical fire killed one officer and ravaged the inside of Chicoutimi last October, its sister boats, Victoria, Windsor and Corner Brook, were pulled out of service.
Two of the submarines were put back in the water last month after a naval board of inquiry delivered its final report into the accident, which claimed the life of Lieut. Chris Saunders, 32, a combat system engineer.
But an internal risk assessment, prepared by naval engineers, concluded on Nov. 1, 2004, that there was nothing 'to prevent the safe resumption of operations in Victoria and Windsor.'
The 33-page document, penned by the navy's subsafe board, recommended that 'the current operational pause be rescinded and that Victoria and Windsor resume their scheduled programs.'
The two submarines, acquired from the British in a $891-million lease-to-purchase agreement, were the only ones operational at the time of the fire.
A third boat, Corner Brook, was docked for a refit when the sailing halt was ordered.
Grover said that during the down time, the navy's top brass ordered critical electrical junction spots, which had been improved prior to the Chicoutimi fire, further insulated.
The recommendation to resume operations was made following a thorough, painstaking examination of the cause of the Chicoutimi fire, which was quickly determined to be electrical in nature.
The review also looked at all operational questions, such as the practice of running the submarine on the surface with open hatches - a move that in the case of Chicoutimi allowed sea water to come in contact with thinly insulated high-voltage connections.
Water splashing on eight under-insulated cables beneath the captain's bunk caused a massive short circuit and fire, which crippled the warship on Oct. 5, 2004, during its maiden voyage to Halifax from Scotland.
Safety issues, including the number of emergency breathing masks, were considered in the study, which was obtained by The Canadian Press under access-to-information laws.
All of the 13 perceived concerns stemming from the Chicoutimi fire were assigned a risk ranking - from acceptable to intolerable - and then measured against inspection reports from the other three boats.
Electrical circuits in Victoria, Windsor and Corner Brook were found to be better insulated.
'There are no intolerable risks arising from this risk assessment and only one undesirable risk,' concluded the subsafe board, which monitors safety issues in the undersea fleet.
The ability of submariners to quickly don emergency breathing masks was considered the single biggest concern, but the board said little could be done because it involved the 'possibility of human error.'
Aside from missed training, an ex-submariner said the hiatus was also a blow to the morale of the navy.
'It hurt,' said D.G. (Buster) Brown of the Submariner's Association of Canada.
Sailors 'became dubious, wondering where we go from here, especially given all of the delays in acquiring the submarines.'
