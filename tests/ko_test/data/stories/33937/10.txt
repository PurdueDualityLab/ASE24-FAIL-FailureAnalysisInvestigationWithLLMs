Navy engineers found other subs safe within a month of Chicoutimi fire

Within weeks of a deadly fire aboard HMCS Chicoutimi, navy engineers and electrical experts deemed Canada's three other used submarines safe and recommended they be put back to sea, say newly released documents.
But the advice was ignored by senior officers who insisted on further technical improvements and were concerned that even the slightest hiccup would have further vexed the glitch-filled program.
"There were a number of different considerations that had to be weighed," said Lieutenant Diane Grover, a spokeswoman for the commander of the navy, Vice-Admiral Bruce MacLean.
"Ultimately the decision was one rooted in responsible risk management and personnel safety."
A defence analyst said keeping the entire fleet sidelined for seven months hurt training in a submarine program that was already behind schedule, but the decision was likely seen as a justifiable trade-off.
"I don't think the navy could have ignored the political implications," said David Rudd of the Canadian Institute for Strategic Studies.
Less than a week after an electrical fire killed one officer and ravaged the inside of Chicoutimi last October, its sister boats, Victoria, Windsor and Corner Brook, were pulled out of service.
Two of the submarines were put back in the water last month after a naval board of inquiry delivered its final report into the accident, which claimed the life of Lt. Chris Saunders, 32, a combat system engineer.
But an internal risk assessment, prepared by naval engineers, concluded on Nov. 1, 2004, that there was nothing "to prevent the safe resumption of operations in Victoria and Windsor."
The 33-page document, penned by the navy's subsafe board, recommended that "the current operational pause be rescinded and that Victoria and Windsor resume their scheduled programs."
The two submarines, acquired from the British military in a $891-million lease-to-purchase agreement, were the only ones operational at the time of the fire.
A third boat, Corner Brook, was docked for a refit when the sailing halt was ordered.
Lt. Grover said that during the down time, the navy's top brass ordered critical electrical junction spots, which had been improved before the Chicoutimi fire, further insulated.
The recommendation to resume operations was made following a thorough, painstaking examination of the cause of the Chicoutimi fire, which was quickly determined to be electrical in nature.
Safety issues, including the number of emergency breathing masks, were considered in the study, which was obtained by The Canadian Press under access-to-information laws.
Aside from missed training, an ex-submariner said the hiatus was a blow to the morale of the navy.
"It hurt," said D. G. (Buster) Brown of the Submariner's Association of Canada.
Sailors "became dubious, wondering where we go from here, especially given all of the delays in acquiring the submarines."
