HALIFAX (CP) -- Within weeks of a deadly fire aboard HMCS Chicoutimi, navy engineers and electrical experts deemed Canada's three other used submarines safe and recommended they be put back to sea, say newly released documents.
But the advice was ignored by senior officers who insisted on further technical improvements and were concerned that even the slightest hiccup would have further vexed the glitch-filled program.
'There were a number of different considerations that had to be weighed,' said Lieut. Diane Grover, a spokeswoman for the commander of the navy, Vice-Admiral Bruce MacLean. 'Ultimately the decision was one rooted in responsible risk management and personnel safety.'
A defence analyst said keeping the entire fleet sidelined for seven months hurt training in a submarine program that was already behind schedule, but the decision was likely considered a justifiable trade-off.
'I don't think the navy could have ignored the political implications,' said David Rudd, president of the Canadian Institute for Strategic Studies.
'A second accident, even a minor one, in the wake of the Chicoutimi fire would have been dynamite. DND had no doubt about the safety and utility of the fleet, but there might have been a lot of people in Parliament that did.'
