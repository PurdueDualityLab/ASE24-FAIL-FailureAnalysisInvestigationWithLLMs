LAUSANNE, Switzerland -- U.S. Olympic Committee President Sandy Baldwin likely will be elected a member of the International Olympic Committee in early February.
The IOC executive board approved Baldwin's candidacy Wednesday, putting her on a short list of 10 that did not include one intriguing nominee: gymnast Nadia Comaneci, known best for scoring seven perfect 10s at the 1976 Summer Olympics.
The IOC rejected the candidacy of Comaneci because she was nominated by the Romanian Olympic Committee but is a U.S. citizen living in Oklahoma. IOC officials said members must live in the country of the national committee they represent.
Baldwin, 62, was nominated by the USOC, which elected her as its leader a year ago. Former USOC president Bill Hybl, the USOC's current representative in the international body, will step down in February, leaving the number of U.S. IOC members at four.
One of those members, Jim Easton, will run for a post on the IOC's executive board in February. Anita DeFrantz was the last IOC executive board member from the USA. Her term ended in July.
Of 82 potential new members put forth for the executive board's approval this week, Baldwin and Comaneci were the only two women nominated. The IOC has 12 women among 123 members.
Problems foreseen: Apparently trying to get out in front of criticism, Salt Lake Organizing Committee President Mitt Romney on Wednesday said, "You can be sure we will have problems" with transportation and information technology at the Feb. 8-24 Winter Olympics.
Transportation and technology presented two of the biggest problems at the last Olympics held on U.S. soil, the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta.
Both SLOC officials and IOC President Jacques Rogge said the transportation glitches in Utah will hinge primarily on the weather.
"It would be naive to say there are no transportation question marks before the Games," Rogge said. "Much will depend on the weather. If the weather is fine, everything will be fine."
In presenting his last progress report to the IOC executive board before February, Romney was asked to review security preparations again. In the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, security has become the prime concern of the Salt Lake City organizers.
Romney went over some of the additional security plans put in place since Sept. 11 but presented nothing new.
IOC officials asked Romney to communicate to national Olympic committees worldwide what kind of screenings and restrictions athletes and others will encounter in places such as the Salt Lake City airport and the Olympic Village. The IOC also sought more assurances that the security will not be too intrusive.
"What they don't see will be substantially different, but what they see won't be terribly different," Romney said.
Rogge said he is "totally reassured as to the level of organization and security measures."
Rising costs: Rogge, who has made cutting the cost of staging the Games one of the central tenets of his presidency, defended Wednesday the amount the U.S. government contributed to the Salt Lake City Olympic budget.
A recent General Accounting Office report estimates the federal government will spend $342 million on the 2002 Winter Games, which doesn't include an additional $40 million added to the security budget after Sept. 11.
"The position of the IOC is that it is not possible to organize the Games well without the support of a central and/or federal government. The best example of that was Sydney," Rogge said.
The total cost of staging the Salt Lake City Olympics is close to $1.9 billion. The last Winter Olympics in the USA, the 1980 Games at Lake Placid, N.Y., reportedly cost $168 million.
The cost of the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano hit $1.14 billion.
Winter sports: Olympic champion Silke Kraushaar won a World Cup luge event, edging teammate Sylke Otto by a thousandth of a second to lead a 1-2-3 sweep for Germany at Igls, Austria. Austrian cousins Tobias and Markus Schiegl won the men's doubles. For the USA, Mark Grimmette and Brian Martin were fifth and Chris Thorpe and Clay Ives eighth.
* World champion Johann Muhlegg of Spain collected his first win of the season in the men's World Cup 15-kilometer Nordic freestyle race at Brusson, Italy. Olympic and World Cup overall champion Julia Tchepalova of Russia edged Italian Stefania Belmondo in the women's 10K freestyle.
Maier progress: Hermann Maier, recuperating from a broken leg sustained in a motorcycle accident in August, said he sees little chance of recovering in time to compete at Salt Lake City. Maier dominated the World Cup in recent seasons and won two gold medals at the 1998 Olympics only days after a spectacular crash.
The racer did express some frustration with his recovery process.
"It's going slower than I expected," he said. Surgeons pinned Maier's leg with a titanium rod and performed a skin graft on the shin, an area where he still is feeling pain.
