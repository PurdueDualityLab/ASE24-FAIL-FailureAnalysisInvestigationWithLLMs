THE mills of sport grind very slowly but, unlike Longfellow's mills of God, they do not grind exceedingly small. The classic case is the fight against doping in sport.
Just under three years ago, sports authorities and Olympic leaders gathered in Lausanne and announced that they were determined to deal with drug cheats and that the only way was a uniform code. Now, after countless meetings, many journeys and millions of pounds, it is clear we are as far away from a uniform code as ever.
A uniform code is essential because it means that when a drug cheat is caught, then whatever the sport, and wherever in the world the cheat has been found, he or she suffers a uniform penalty. This, for a first offence, should be a two-year suspension.
However, the problem has been that various sports find it very difficult to accept a two-year penalty and the world's biggest sport, football, believes that professional players will go to law. And since sports authorities react to lawyers in the same way Dracula reacted to the cross, it means there can be no kind of uniformity in dealing with drug-takers.
Yesterday in Lausanne, Dick Pound, chairman of the World Anti- Doping Agency, tried to put the best possible face on this. Two weeks ago he had a meeting with Sepp Blatter, the president of FIFA, football's world governing body, which he described at the time as "very positive", saying that the pair had "reached, on a handshake basis, a comprehensive agreement".
It is easy to see, from Pound's perspective, why he found all this very encouraging. In August he had confessed that he could not even get any replies from FIFA about fighting drugs. So, the fact that he got Blatter to a table was progress. However, the reality is that the progress was cosmetic, and that Blatter had not moved from the position he took in February 1999 during the Lausanne anti-doping conference when he made his opposition to a uniform code very clear.
As Pound put it yesterday: "His comment was, `what happens if I sign the anti-doping code and the first sentence is two years and the courts say two years is far too long, six months would have been plenty. But by then two years have gone and FIFA is landed with millions of dollars in damages'."
True, in the last three years, sports and governments round the world have been talking and WADA, a partnership of the two, have been set up.
Pound feels that if a uniform code is developed by Athens 2004, it will not only be a miracle but a "fast-track miracle". But the sombre fact is that in three years, sports authorities and governments have shown they can talk a good game but cannot quite perform.
Nothing illustrates this better than the problems with erythropoietin (EPO). Just before the Sydney Olympics, the combined blood and urine test was announced as a major breakthrough. The hope was a stand-alone urine test could be developed. But now, after pounds 2 million on research, it has turned out the urine test cannot work and we are back to the combined urine and blood for the Winter Games in Salt Lake City.
The Olympic authorities thought science could help beat the lawyers but failure to develop a urine-only test means we could get more scandals like the one involving Olga Yegorova in Sydney when she got away with a positive EPO test on a technicality.
But if this is dispiriting, what is uplifting is that, in Jacques Rogge, the Olympic movement have a leader who is proving a welcome change from Antonio Samaranch. Francois Carrard, the Swiss IOC director general,
said that going from
Samaranch to Rogge was like moving from a Spanish restaurant to a Belgian moule and frites place. Rogge refused to respond yesterday, laughing it off, but in the five months since he took over, many Spanish customs of Samaranch have gone.
So while Rogge will make the traditional plea for peace when he opens the Salt Lake Games, he is under no illusions about a possible ceasefire. "We are not wanting states to do things that are not achievable," he said. "The IOC are a sport organisation. They cannot pretend to enforce peace but add a symbolic voice. Don't ask the IOC to take the role of a peacekeeper that governments and religions cannot achieve."
Rogge knows that the Salt Lake organisers admit there could be transport and technology glitches. He admits that if the weather is really nasty in February, transport at the Games could be a problem.
Rogge also knows that he has his hands full trying to get more women into the IOC and also the right sort of member. The new list of 10 candidates includes only one prominent athlete, Matthew Pinsent, and one woman. Nadia Comaneci was proposed but could not accept because she lives in the United States, not her birthplace of Romania. How to get a better-balanced IOC is his concern rather than trying to be a world statesman, as Samaranch pretended to be.
