THE snows lie deep on the peaks of Afghanistan, but they will have no competitor at the Winter Olympics. The Taliban's refusal to let females participate in sport has ensured they are the only nation on earth to be excluded from the Olympic movement.
Rehabilitation is already being discussed, but messages are as confused as that stricken country's political future.
The International Olympic Committee, which loves to claim the moral high ground, has already rejected appeals for Afghanistan to have a team in Salt Lake City. "We are not in favour of tokenism, sending one or two Afghan athletes," said president Jacques Rogge. "Athletes must be trained, must have a good, decent level. That, of course, is impossible today in Afghanistan."
However, Rogge is to dispatch the IOC's respected senior diplomat, Fekrou Kidane, to Kabul as soon as political stability is achieved.
Sending an Ethiopian will be seen as politically correct. Contrast that, then, with the UN. An Olympic truce was proposed, by US Olympic Committee man William J Hybl, no less, a member of the IOC and the US delegation to the United Nations. Having bombed the country to oblivion, there is talk of building sports centres as an antidote to terrorism. Such ideas would have been better proposed by any one of the UN's 188 other members.
I believe the Olympic movement to be an outstanding vehicle for promoting peace, racial and religious harmony, and enriching lives. Yet so often the Games themselves become a political football.
When spending so much on Salt Lake, the hosts might have considered wider social issues. In 1980 Russia solved a perceived problem by transporting beggars and the intellectually disadvantaged out of Moscow. Now, the Olympics coincide with escalating homelessness and hunger in the host city.
The US Conference of Mayors this week revealed that requests for emergency food aid in Salt Lake increased by 55% this year, the largest increase among the 27 major US cities studied, with 10% turned away and residents seeking shelter up by 12%. The Olympics, say impoverished Utah residents, have exacerbated problems. With the second day of the torch relay yesterday reaching that bastion of US liberalism, Little Rock, Arkansas, just 57 days before the opening ceremony, what are the omens?
Assurances from Mitt Romney, president of the Salt Lake organising committee, are not comforting. His final IOC briefing warned: "You can be sure we will have problems . . . It is virtually certain that information technology will have software challenges . . . You can't put in place an information technology system like ours that costs $300m and expect it to work on day one."
No? Perhaps a more expensive one would have been glitch-free? Should we then be concerned at a security system costing a mere $310m?
The organisers of the most expensive Winter Games ((pounds) 1910m, not including the bribes to swing the vote) have felt compelled to re- invent the wheel. No change there, then. Offered the tried-and- tested Barcelona computer system from 1992 for the Atlanta Olympics four years later, the US declined "a Spic system", and insisted on an "Amurrican one". It remained horrendous throughout the Games.
Info-tech threatens to be similarly fraught this time. SchlumbergerSema started from scratch in 1999, drawing together 40 partners. Their system relies on 32,000 miles of fibre-optic cable. Three days of simulation caused computer applications to crash, network segments lost their connections, and emergency repairs were slow. Seven days of tests next week will attempt to "iron out the bugs".
Threatened with transport meltdown just before the 2000 Olympics, Sydney made it virtually impossible for cars to reach major venues, forcing spectators on to public transport. Salt Lake expects more than 80% of spectators to use cars. Let chaos begin.
