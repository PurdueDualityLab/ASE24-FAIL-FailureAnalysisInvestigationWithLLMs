Olympic glitches 'won't happen'

Pfister discounted predictions of trouble last week from Salt Lake Olympic chief Mitt Romney, who warned IOC officials that "it is virtually certain that information technology will have software challenges" that could unleash chaos during the February games.
"That won't happen," Pfister said in a telephone interview from New York City.
His company, in charge of making sure 40 computer systems run seamlessly during the games, is making its Olympic debut in Salt Lake City.
SchlumbergerSema replaced IBM as an Olympic sponsor and oversees 15 technology partners, many of them also new to the Olympics. Romney told reporters last week: "You can be sure we will have problems" with the computer system.
Those comments were overblown, Pfister said, and showed an unfamiliarity with the technology, which is designed to instantly report the times and results of Olympic athletes and events to broadcasters, the media, and an Olympic Web site.
"Information technology is a bit of a mystery to some people, but we do this every day," Pfister said.
The system, using 10 million lines of software code, also must transmit live video of the games, juggle competition and transportation schedules, process 80,000 credentials and security badges, and provide athlete biographies and background on winter sports for the media.
