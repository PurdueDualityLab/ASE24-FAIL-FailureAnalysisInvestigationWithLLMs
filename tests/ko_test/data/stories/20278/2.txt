Traffic, computer woes expected at Olympics

Get ready for traffic jams and computer trouble at the Winter Olympics.
In their final video conference with the International Olympic Committee's executive board, organizers of the Salt Lake City Games warned Wednesday of trouble in the two areas that have plagued recent Olympics.
"You can be sure we will have problems," Salt Lake Organizing Committee president Mitt Romney told reporters. "It is virtually certain that information technology will have software challenges (and) that we will have transportation glitches."
Bad weather probably will combine with heavy traffic to create delays on Interstate 80, the steep highway that climbs from Salt Lake City to Park City. Four venues are in that area.
Organizers are working to perfect a computer network to instantly calculate the times and scores of athletes at 10 venues and ship those statistics around the globe. The system showed signs of trouble during three days of simulated competition in October, and another seven-day test will be run next week.
