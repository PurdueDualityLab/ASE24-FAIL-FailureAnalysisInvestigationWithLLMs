IOC 'Reassured' That Oly Security Is Satisfactory

LAUSANNE, Switzerland -- If Mitt Romney's final report to the International Olympic Committee's Executive Board on Wednesday was akin to a semester-ending exam in Winter Games planning, he clearly aced the test.
Most of all, the president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee was able, without being specific, to assure the IOC that the 2002 Games will be as safe as they can be in a troubled world.
Romney's presentation was delivered with such certitude that IOC President Jacques Rogge didn't hesitate when he stepped to the microphone moments later. "We're totally reassured with the organization in Salt Lake City and the security measures are satisfactory," he said.
"You can never guarantee anything is 100 percent [safe]," Rogge said, "but everything that can be set up has been set up in a remarkable manner."
And in this post-Sept. 11 climate, that is what the IOC wanted the world to hear.
Romney's post-report synopsis to the news media barely touched on the security issue so prevalent in the minds of Utah residents and the people who will attend the Games, many as part of their jobs.
He chose instead to discuss the traditional hazards faced by Winter Olympics organizers every four years -- unruly weather, transportation snarls and glitches in the information technology system that delivers event results and a million other facts.
"You can be sure we'll have problems," Romney said, and SLOC will "best be measured in how we respond" to problems.
For example, Interstate 80 between Salt Lake City and Park City will be taxed to the limit on five of the 17 days of the Games, a challenge that bad weather could quickly turn into a nightmare.
"We will have glitches," acknowledged SLOC chief operating officer Fraser Bullock.
The theme of Bullock's remarks was one that Utahns will hear again and again over the next eight weeks: Car pool. Take buses. Do everything you can to help make the Olympics a smooth-running success.
Romney told reporters that IOC Executive Board members were interested in getting more tickets to events such as late-round and gold-medal hockey games. He said he told them what he would tell anyone: Check the ticket packages on SLOC's Web site. Check with national Olympic committees that might not use their entire allotments. Or try a scalper.
Scalping is not illegal in Utah and business is likely to be brisk during the Games.
Romney and Rogge also said Salt Lake City Mayor Rocky Anderson and the City Council are not going to tarnish the "Look of the Games" by letting every two-bit entrepreneur set up T-shirt stands on street corners. Nor will non-Olympic sponsors be allowed to horn in on Games publicity with rip-offs that would diminish the value of multimillion- dollar investments made by legitimate corporate sponsors.
Romney said he spent considerable time advising the IOC Executive Board on how much money the federal government has invested in the Salt Lake Olympics. The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, put the figure at $342 million -- plus perhaps another $50 million for additional security following the Sept. 11 attacks.
Rogge said the figures affirm the IOC's position that "it is not possible to organize the Games without the support of government."
And, he added, the investment clearly will leave a positive legacy long after Utah's Olympics are history.
