OLYMPICS / NOTES Material from wire services, the US Olympic Committee, sports federations, and interviews was used in this report.
Though the International Olympic Committee plans to send an envoy to Kabul to see about getting Afghanistan back into the Olympic family in the post-Taliban era, there's no chance of any Afghan athletes competing in Salt Lake.
"We are not in favor of tokenism and sending one or two," said IOC president Jacques Rogge. It's likely, though, that Afghan athletes will be in Athens for the 2004 Games because the IOC wants all 200 recognized nations there. Says Rogge: "It would be a dream."
Nominees are . . .
As expected, United States Olympic Committee president Sandra Baldwin has been nominated to replace predecessor Bill Hybl on the IOC. What she's joining, though, will resemble the same old-boys' club that was supposed to evolve after the post-scandal reforms. Only two women were proposed, and Romania's Nadia Comaneci (yes, that Nadia) was rejected because she lives in the US. At least the 10 new members have geographical diversity: athlete Matthew Pinsent (Great Britain), Prince Nawaf Fahd Abdul Aziz (Saudi Arabia), Kikis Lazarides (Cyprus), Yong Sung Park (South Korea), Patrick Chamunda (Zambia), Sheik Tamim Bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani (Qatar), Kai Holm (Denmark), Francois Narmon (Belgium), and Youssoupha Ndiaye (Senegal). The nominees still have to be elected at the IOC meeting before the Games in Salt Lake, but that's usually a formality . . . Back at Olympic headquarters in Switzerland last week for the first time since he left the presidency last summer was Juan Antonio Samaranch. The 81-year-old former chief Lord of the Rings, who collapsed from extreme exhaustion after the IOC meetings in Moscow, made a token visit ("I do not want to interfere.") as honorary- president-for-life. "It's different," Samaranch observed. "Now, I have to learn how to be ex-president." . . . Looks like triathlon will stay in the Olympic program - assuming the politically-chaotic international federation cleans up its act. The IOC sports people gave the green light last week - with a caution sign . . . Peter Blake, the New Zealand skipper who twice won the America's Cup before he was murdered recently by Brazilian pirates, got a posthumous nod from the Lords last week. He was voted the Olympic Order, the IOC's highest honor.
Time running down
Hype aside, the US Olympic men's hockey team may not announce all of its final eight players (two goalies, three defensemen, three forwards) Wednesday. The selectors have until Saturday to finalize the 23-man roster and still are sifting candidates. Among the likelies: Mike Richter (NY Rangers), Tom Barrasso (Carolina), Aaron Miller (Los Angeles), Eric Weinrich (Philadelphia), and Mark Parrish (NY Islanders). Still in the mix are Brian Rolston and Hal Gill of the Bruins . . . Tomorrow morning, what coach Ben Smith calls "the sword of Damocles" falls on two members of the US women's ice hockey team to get the roster down to the Olympic limit of 20. Said to be on the bubble are 1998 veterans Sue Merz and Shelley Looney, plus Annamarie Holmes, Lyndsay Wall, and Carisa Zaban. Next up for the Americans after Christmas is the Lake Placid holiday tournament against Russia, Germany, and the Dartmouth varsity . . . If the International Skating Union wanted to add pizzazz to its Grand Prix figure skating final by requiring two different long programs, the idea has backfired. Virtually everybody is dusting off last year's routine, right down to the costumes. "After a few years, we will skate three long programs, a couple shorts, an exhibition," joked Irina Slut skaya. This year's format change, from head-to-head for first and third places to a 20-30-50 percent formula, left even the skaters confused. "You probably know more about it than we do," Michelle Kwan admitted . . . The Russians, who've won six of the seven Olympic ice dancing titles, didn't qualify anybody for this weekend's Grand Prix final. Not that they didn't have a few expats skating under other flags - Marina Anissina for France, Sergei Sakhnovski for Israel, and Moscow-born Margarita Drobiazko for Lithuania . . . Frank Carroll, who parted ways with Kwan just before the season, has a new pupil: Olympic hopeful Angela Nikodinov, whose coach, Elena Tcherkasskaia, died of pancreatic cancer last month. Carroll coaches US men's champ Tim Goebel.
Sled shuffle
Stunning breakup among the US women's bobsledders last week, with driver Jean Racine dumping longtime brakeman Jen Davidson for newcomer (and former bodybuilder) Gea Johnson, who was pushing for rival Bonny Warner. Davidson, who had won two world titles with Racine and done half a million dollars' worth of endorsements with her (including some pre-Olympic TV ads), felt blindsided. Not that the team brass was upset - with the Americans now relegated to third behind two German sleds in the World Cup standings and the Olympic trials a fortnight away, the coaches reportedly had been itching for a shake-up. Todd Hays is still riding high on the men's circuit, No. 1 overall at the holiday break and guaranteed a place on the US team for Salt Lake . . . The US Olympic speed skating trials (both at the same place at the same time for the first time) wind up next weekend at the Olympic oval in the Salt Lake suburb of Kearns, with most of the spots - 20 for long-track, 12 for short-track - still up for grabs. Already on the long-track team, based on previous performances, are Jennifer Rodriguez, Christine Witty, Casey FitzRandolph, and Derek Parra. In the chase again is Chelmsford native Marc Pelchat, who made the 1998 team out of nowhere at 30. Among the short-trackers, Apolo Anton Ohno already has a spot. Also likely to qualify are Nagano vets Dan Weinstein of Brookline and Caroline Hallisey of Natick . . . The speedskating federation, by the way, has come up with a unique "bereavement bye," which allows skaters who likely would have qualified to be put on the team if a parent, spouse, or sibling dies within a week of the trials.
Start bodes well
Bode Miller's gangbusters start on the Alpine circuit - two golds and a silver already - has US ski types fantasizing about him winning the overall title. The last American to do it was Phil Mahre, who won three straight in 1981-83. Miller is second behind Austria's Stephan Eberharter . . . Last chance for the US lugers to pile up crucial World Cup points comes this weekend in Germany at the last event before the federation chooses the Olympic team after the holidays. Becky Wilczak and the doubles team of Mark Grimmette and Brian Martin already have locked up berths, but the other six places are open. The tightest race is among Brenna Margol, Courtney Zablocki, and Westborough's Ashley Hayden for the final two women's spots. "It's a hard thing to watch, because we're all so close," said Wil czak. "Some of us want to talk about it and some of us don't." . . . True to what his staffers call his ability to find risk where there is none, Salt Lake organizing chief Mitt Romney told the IOC to expect glitches in information technology and transportation during the Games. "You can be sure we will have problems," Romney said in his videoconference report. It's part of Romney's strategy to "underpromise and overdeliver", a lesson he learned from the Atlanta computer-and-bus debacle in 1996 . . . Why is Rachel Steer the only US biathlete on the World Cup circuit? Because she was training in Europe while the rest of the squad is in Utah preparing for the Olympic trials at the end of the month at Soldier Hollow. Once the team is picked, they'll head overseas for three Cups before the Games . . . Best finish ever (third behind Cuba and Russia) for the US wrestlers at the recent Greco-Roman championships in Greece. Olympic hero Rulon Gardner won gold at 130 kilograms and Brandon Paulson (54 kg) and Matt Lindland (85 kg) added silvers. Illustration
