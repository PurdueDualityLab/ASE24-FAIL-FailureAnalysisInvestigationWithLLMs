Expect Traffic Woes at Olympics

Get ready for traffic jams and computer trouble at the Winter Olympics.
In their final video conference with the IOC's executive board, organizers of the Salt Lake City Games warned Wednesday of trouble in the two areas that have plagued recent Olympics.
'You can be sure we will have problems,' Salt Lake Organizing Committee president Mitt Romney told reporters. 'It is virtually certain that information technology will have software challenges (and) that we will have transportation glitches.'
Bad weather probably will combine with heavy traffic to create delays on Interstate 80, the steep highway that climbs from Salt Lake City to Park City.
About 1,500 cars an hour head toward Park City. During the Olympics, as many as 7,000 vehicles will clog the road, most trying to get to the four venues in the area.
Organizers are most concerned about highway conditions Feb. 12, the busiest day of the Olympics.
That day will bring 'our highest load' on the highway, SLOC chief operating officer Fraser Bullock said. 'We're hoping to get the word out to people to car pool, avoid trips and be patient with us. We will have glitches in transportation.'
Romney and Bullock said Utah's ability to react quickly to the problems will determine how bad things get.
The federal government has contributed more than $100 million to build park-and-ride lots near Olympic venues and bring hundreds of extra transit buses and drivers to Salt Lake City. Still, organizers expect more than 80 percent of Olympic spectators to drive their own cars, clogging the roadways.
Olympic organizers are working to perfect a computer network to instantly calculate the times and scores of athletes at 10 venues and ship those statistics around the globe.
The system showed signs of trouble during three days of simulated Olympic competition in October. That's when computer applications crashed, network segments lost their connections and emergency repairs worked slowly.
Olympic supplier SchlumbergerSema is in charge of computer systems tied by 32,000 miles of fiber-optic cables. The company started from scratch in 1999, bringing together 40 technology partners.
They will run another, seven-day computer test next week to try to work out the bugs.
Salt Lake organizers also briefed IOC executive board members on security for the games and a government report putting the cost of the games at $1.9 billion, the most ever for a Winter Olympics.
With the release of that report, IOC members want the U.S. government to take a second look, this time tallying the benefits of the games.
'I'm not sure exactly where to go for that kind of information,' Romney said. 'But they felt ... it also would be interesting for the government to carry out a thorough economic analysis of the benefits to the country in terms of tourism dollars and so forth.'
