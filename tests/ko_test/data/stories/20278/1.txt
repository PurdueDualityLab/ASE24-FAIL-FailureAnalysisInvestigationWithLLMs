Problems will abound in Salt Lake City

Traffic jams and computer trouble probably will torment the Winter Olympics, Salt Lake City organizers said Thursday.
In their final video conference with the International Olympic Committee's executive board, the organizers warned of trouble ahead in the two areas that have plagued recent editions of the Games. 'You can be sure we will have problems,' Mitt Romney, the president of Salt Lake's organizing committee, told reporters. 'It is virtually certain that information technology will have software challenges (and) that we will have transportation glitches.'
Bad weather likely will combine with heavy traffic to create delays on the highway that climbs from Salt Lake City to Park City.
Romney and Bullock said Utah's ability to react quickly to the problems will determine how bad things get. The federal government has contributed more than $100 million to build park-and-ride lots near Olympic venues and bring hundreds of extra transit buses and drivers to Salt Lake City. Still, organizers expect more than 80 per cent of Olympic spectators to drive their own cars, clogging roadways.
