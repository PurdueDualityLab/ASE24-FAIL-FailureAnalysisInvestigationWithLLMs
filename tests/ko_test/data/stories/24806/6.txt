THE WASHINGTON POST
WASHINGTON - A small group of frequent-flier fanatics gathered here recently at trendy Ozio bar and restaurant to swap secrets of the trade. These are travelers who fly to London and back in a day on cheap Internet fares just to rack up the miles, or intentionally book flights with several stopovers so they can boost their frequent- flier elite status, which is based on the number of segments flown. Each has more than 100,000 miles with several airlines and flies two or three times a month.
Over drinks and dinner each month at different Washington restaurants, they debate the loopholes in their frequent-flier programs, strategize over fares, complain about Internet travel sites and argue over their favorite aircraft - predominately the Boeing 777. They proclaim, denounce and cheer with the enthusiasm of football fans at a local sports bar.
The participants were all single professionals linked by their appreciation for a popular Web site for avid frequent fliers called Flyertalk.com. Their mania for frequent flying is evident in their Internet user names: "liveforflying," "mileageaddict" "mrstaralliance."
"My friends think I'm crazy," said Brian Hall, 27, of Silver Spring, Md.
For these business travelers, the goal is to upgrade. They rarely redeem mileage awards for free trips. Rather, they get their thrills from business or first-class upgrades that put them next to travelers who paid thousands of dollars for the same seats. "We often know more than the employees about their own rules and regulations," said Frank Ross, 34, of McLean, Va.
They have their own language. Washington sales consultant David Rodrigue is a "CP," or Chairman's Preferred, the highest ranking in US Airways' frequent-flier program. People who purchase the cheapest fares, "L" class fares available on some carriers, are considered losers.
That's mainly because the fare often has so many restrictions and doesn't allow travelers to upgrade to first or business class. And they avoid speaking to travelers who land in the middle seat in coach. "If they weren't savvy enough to get an aisle or window seat, why bother," Rodrigue said jokingly.
They also love to swoop in on rare glitches. In November, when British Airways accidentally published $20 roundtrip fares to Europe on its Web site, Hall learned of the deal from Flyertalk.com and bought several tickets to Amsterdam and Rome before the carrier removed the fares several hours later.
Although the members are pleased that Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways have forced the larger airlines to lower their fares, they still don't fly the low-cost carriers. Ross said he often can find lower fares elsewhere. Rodrigue said he doesn't fly Southwest because it doesn't offer priority boarding. And Alysia Brown of Alexandria, Va., avoids the Dallas-based carrier because it's too noisy. "It's full of novice travelers and their kids," she said.
While the club may be elitist, it's not exclusive. "We're very helpful to the new fliers. We try to help them as much as we can," Rodrigue said.
