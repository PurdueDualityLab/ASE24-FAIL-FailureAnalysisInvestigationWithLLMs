Flight clubs pull no punches

A small group of frequent-flyer fanatics gathered recently at a restaurant to swap secrets. These are travellers who fly to London and back in a day on cheap Internet fares just to rack up the miles, or intentionally book flights with several stop-overs so they can boost their frequent-flyer elite status, which is based on the number of segments flown. Each has more than 100,000 miles with several airlines and flies two or three times a month.
Over drinks and dinner each month at different Washington restaurants, they debate the loopholes in their frequent-flyer programs, strategize over fares, complain about Internet travel sites and argue about their favourite aircraft -- predominately the Boeing 777. They proclaim, denounce and cheer with the enthusiasm of football fans at a local sports bar.
The participants were all single professionals linked by their appreciation for Flyertalk.com, a popular Web site for avid frequent flyers. Their mania for frequent flying is evident in their Internet user names: liveforflying, mileageaddict, mrstaralliance.
'My friends think I'm crazy,' said Brian Hall, 27, of Silver Spring, Md.
For these business travellers, the goal is to upgrade. They rarely redeem mileage awards for free trips. Rather, they get their thrills from business or first-class upgrades that put them next to travellers who paid thousands of dollars for the same seats.
'We often know more than the employees about their own rules and regulations,' said Frank Ross, 34, of McLean, Va.
These folks have their own language. Washington sales consultant David Rodrigue is a CP, or Chairman's Preferred, the highest rank in US Airways' frequent-flyer program. People who purchase the cheapest fares -- L-class fares available on some carriers -- are considered losers, mainly because the fare often has so many restrictions and doesn't allow travellers to upgrade.
These flyers avoid speaking to travellers who land in the middle seat in coach. 'If they weren't savvy enough to get an aisle or window seat, why bother?' Rodrigue joked.
They also love to swoop in on rare glitches. In November, when British Airways accidentally published $20 round-trip fares to Europe on its Web site, Hall learned of the deal from Flyertalk.com and bought several tickets to Amsterdam and Rome before the carrier removed the fares hours later.
Although the members are pleased that Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways have forced the larger airlines to lower their fares, they don't use the low-cost carriers. Ross said he often can find lower fares elsewhere. Rodrigue said he doesn't fly Southwest because it doesn't offer priority boarding. Alysia Brown of Alexandria, Va., avoids the Dallas-based carrier because it's too noisy. 'It's full of novice travellers and their kids,' she said.
While the club may be elitist, it's not exclusive. 'We're very helpful to the new flyers,' Rodrigue said. That is, until the newcomers begin competing for upgrades.
The members use travel sites such as Travelocity, Expedia and Orbitz only to help locate fares. They book the fares directly on the airlines' Web sites to avoid paying travel sites' booking fees and to nab frequent-flyer miles.
Rodrigue goes to SideStep (www.sidestep.com), downloads software and searches for cheap fares. He says he's 'obsessed' with getting the most miles for as little money as possible. He visits the site several times a day.
Flyertalk.com was founded in 1998 by Randy Petersen, publisher of Inside Flyer magazine, because he was unable to respond to an overwhelming number of calls, letters and e-mails. Members frequently post comments on the site, which has six million registered users worldwide, according to Petersen.
Users post questions about airline and hotel rules such as checking bags, earning or redeeming miles, rights during bad weather, and notify each other when carriers match competitors' frequent-flyer programs.
The site, which is free for users, is largely supported by advertisers, most of whom are travel companies.
Business on the Move -- a column exploring the world of business travel -- appears occasionally in Travel.
