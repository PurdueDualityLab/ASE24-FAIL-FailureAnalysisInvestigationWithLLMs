It's a thrill sitting next to travellers who paid thousands of dollars for the same seats
A small group of frequent-flier fanatics gathered in Washington, D.C., recently at trendy Ozio bar and restaurant to swap secrets of the trade. These are travellers who fly to London and back in a day on cheap Internet fares just to rack up the miles, or intentionally book flights with several stopovers so they can boost their frequent- flier elite status, which is based on the number of segments flown. Each has more than 100,000 miles with several airlines and flies two or three times a month.
Over drinks and dinner each month, they debate the loopholes in their frequent-flier programs, strategize over fares, complain about Internet travel sites and argue over their favourite aircraft -- predominately the Boeing 777. They proclaim, denounce and cheer with the enthusiasm of football fans at a local sports bar.
The participants were all professionals linked by their appreciation for a popular Web site for avid frequent fliers called Flyertalk.com. Their mania for frequent flying is evident in their Internet user names, such as "liveforflying," and "mileageaddict."
"My friends think I'm crazy," said Brian Hall, 27, of Silver Spring, Maryland. For these business travellers, the goal is to upgrade. They rarely redeem mileage awards for free trips. Rather, they get their thrills from business or first-class upgrades that put them next to travellers who paid thousands of dollars for the same seats. "We often know more than the (airline) employees about their own rules and regulations," said Frank Ross, 34, of McLean, Virginia.
They also love to swoop in on rare glitches. In November, when British Airways accidentally published $20 roundtrip fares to Europe on its Web site, Hall learned of the deal from Flyertalk.com and bought several tickets to Amsterdam and Rome before the carrier removed the fares several hours later.
The members use travel sites such as Travelocity, Expedia and Orbitz only to help locate fares. But they book the fares directly on the airlines' Web sites to avoid paying the travel sites' booking fees and to nab the frequent-flier miles. David Rodrigue goes to another travel site, SideStep (www.sidestep.com), downloads its software and searches for cheap fares. Rodrigue admits he's "obsessed" with getting the most miles for as little money as possible and visits the site several times a day.
Flyertalk.com was founded in 1998 by Randy Petersen, publisher of Inside Flyer magazine, because he was unable to respond to an overwhelming number of calls, letters and e-mails. People frequently post comments on the free site, which has six million registered users worldwide, according to Petersen. Users post questions about airline and hotel rules such as checking bags, earning or redeeming miles, rights during bad weather, and when carriers match competitors' frequent-flier programs.
