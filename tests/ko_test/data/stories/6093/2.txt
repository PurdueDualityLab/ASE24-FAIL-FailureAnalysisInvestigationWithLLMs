WHILE MUCH REMAINS TO BE DONE TO PREPARE FOR THE YEAR-2000 problem, the gas industry is cautiously optimistic that it will be ready for the potential Y2K computer glitches that could affect system operations, representatives from Ferc and interstate pipelines reiterated last week. Warnings that 100% compliance for every system can't be guaranteed were mixed with assurances that the industry is moving through the assessment and remediation phases towards validation that its equipment will work.
At a hearing before the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Kathleen Hirning, chief information officer at Ferc, noted that in a recent baseline survey of gas and oil companies, 85% of responding companies reported having prioritized their hardware, software and embedded systems according to ''mission critical functions.'' She added that, following attempts to fix the potential problems, companies have begun developing contingency plans (IF, 28 Sept, 17). ''About a third of the respondents who provided a date indicated that they expect their contingency plans to be ready by the end of this year, three quarters by June 1999 and all by December 1999,'' Hirning testified.
In a separate survey conducted earlier by the Interstate Natural Gas Assn. of America, pipelines cited safety, maintaining the flow of gas, accounting for and measuring the flow, and securing internal business systems as the relative priorities of the industry, according to Anne Wilms, chief information officer at Sonat Inc. She said Sonat's efforts to examine and test each pipeline device, evaluate vendors' efforts, and develop contingency plans were representative of the entire industry's actions.
With 90% of pipeline system operations dependent on external service providers, Wilms said that monitoring outside companies' Y2K efforts was vital. Because of such interdependence, Hirning also underlined the importance of working closely with the telecommunications, electric, transportation and finance sectors to ensure that all facets of the economy are prepared for 2000.
Hirning told Inside F.E.R.C. that the oil and gas segment will ''reach out and join forces'' with these related sectors -- which are represented by working groups within the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion -- to better understand their progress. She called such coordinated efforts within the council a ''real advantage'' in the struggle to be year-2000 ready.
The future looks good for local distribution companies as well, according to testimony. Asked by Committee Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Pa., about retail-level delivery systems' Y2K problems, Wilms explained that LDCs are much less dependent on embedded chips that are susceptible to malfunctions associated with Y2K than are interstate pipelines.
