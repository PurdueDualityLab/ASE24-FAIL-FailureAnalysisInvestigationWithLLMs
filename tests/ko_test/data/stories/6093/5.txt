GAS INDUSTRY MOVING CONFIDENTLY TO MEET Y2K CHALLENGE, FERC TOLD

There is no false sense of security underlying the gas industry's confidence in its ability to address the year-2000 computer problem, officials assured FERC at a Sept. 18 technical conference. Although only 22% of the oil and gas companies responding to a recent industry survey expect to have their operational systems ready for 2000 by the end of this year, all anticipate being ready by December 1999, executives reported.
The industry is required by regulators and good business sense to plan for disasters and is ''well versed in what it takes to address issues that come up in an ice storm or a hurricane,'' said Gary Gardner, chief information officer at the American Gas Assn. And while ''we've never handled a Y2K storm,'' this challenge, like any natural disaster, has pushed companies to develop solutions, said Gardner. The industry is moving toward the final stages of the remediation process and will start to focus more heavily on contingency plans, he added.
About 31% of the survey respondents anticipated having backup plans in place by Dec. 31, with the number growing to 100% by Dec. 31, 1999, said Interstate Natural Gas Assn. of America Executive Vice President Skip Horvath. He appeared at the conference on behalf of the Natural Gas Council, which led the survey project on the gas side.
According to Horvath, contingency planning predictably is less developed because companies are taking the operational steps necessary to ensure that daily business runs smoothly.
The survey found companies are furthest along in fixing their software systems, but a majority of those surveyed also are in the critical stages of ''assessment'' or ''remediation'' of their embedded, operational systems. This includes both internal efforts as well as working with vendors and suppliers to assess the anticipated problems, make corrections and test the solutions. Some 14% of respondents said they now are validating their embedded systems, and 76% expect to be Y2K ready by June 1999. All respondents asserted they will be fully prepared by December 1999.
''At this stage, the public understands nobody is done,'' said John Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion, and the survey, titled ''The Gas and Oil Industry Survey Year-2000 Readiness Aggregate Results,'' should help inform the public about the industry's progress. One concern for all U.S. sectors is public overreaction to the possibility of glitches because panic, in the form of major behavioral pattern changes, could lead to a ''self-fulfilling prophecy'' of economic instability, he said.
''Our strategy, as we move through this next 14 months, . . . is to be as transparent as we can about where we are, about what works, where we are struggling with problems, where we are in terms of remediation and what our contingency plans are,'' Koskinen said.
The gas council has decided that one way it can do that is to ''rely on the FERC Web site as our primary method of informing the public,'' Horvath said. Aggregate survey results, as well as those compiled by the individual industry trade groups, were expected to be posted on the site (www.ferc.fed.us) this week, and future studies will follow at that location, he added.
The industry officials expressed satisfaction that two-thirds of the polled companies responded to the baseline survey, but Horvath urged the trade groups to strive to raise the response rate in the next assessment due in February. Of the 800 oil and gas companies that responded, 71% were labeled as small firms based on revenue, said Horvath, who added that the demographics reveal that smaller companies are concerned about the Y2K problem and are very engaged in dealing with it.
The strong response from small companies indeed should temper any concerns that they are lagging in compliance efforts, agreed Robert Cave, executive director of the American Public Gas Assn. He went on to relay his members' message that much of the heavily used mechanical and manual equipment in the field is not susceptible to the Y2K problem and will require little new investment for the transition.
While encouraged by the findings of the survey, Koskinen cautioned that ''there's a race to be run here, and we're making progress, but we've got a long way to go.'' Industry officials ''were impressed with the incredibly comprehensive nature of the plans,'' Horvath said. ''We are, we feel, on our way to being year-2000 ready well in time for that particular planned event.''
