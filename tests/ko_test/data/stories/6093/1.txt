WITH 14 MONTHS TO GO, GAS, OIL COMPANIES FEEL GOOD ABOUT Y2K READINESS

Most gas and oil companies are still assessing their potential year-2000 problems and reworking computerized and electronic equipment to avoid breakdowns come Jan. 1, 2000, according to a recent survey. An estimated 76% expect to be prepared for the new year by June and all anticipate being ready by December 1999, industry officials reported at a Sept. 18 Ferc technical conference.
Working to solve the ''once-in-a-thousand-years problem,'' industry representatives convened as part of the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion to review ongoing compliance efforts. Together with the Gas Industry Standards Board and the American Petroleum Institute, the Natural Gas Council led the survey effort on the gas side, tallying data from 800 companies of all sizes.
While gas and oil companies were found to be further along in fixing Y2K problems in their software systems, the majority of those surveyed (54%) reported that they were in the critical stages of ''assessment'' or ''remediation'' involving their embedded, or operational, systems. This includes both internal efforts as well as working with vendors and suppliers to assess the anticipated problems, make corrections and test the solutions.
According to the report, 14% of respondents asserted that they are currently validating their embedded systems, and 22% of the companies expect to be Y2K ready by December 1998. All those responding said they will be fully prepared by December 1999.
Representing the council, Skip Horvath, executive vice president of the Interstate Natural Gas Assn. of America, reported that while some in the field claim contingency plans are never fully completed, 100% of the respondents said they expect to have such a backup strategy in place by December 1999. However, only 31% anticipate having the plan in place by this December.
According to Horvath, contingency plans lag behind the steps to ensure that daily business runs smoothly. Like the overall plans to address the Y2K headache, the contingency plans stress the operational side of the business, focusing on production, transportation and distribution processes, he pointed out.
Besides providing analysis of the contingency plans, industry executives said the survey, titled ''The Gas and Oil Industry Survey Year-2000 Readiness Aggregate Results,'' was intended to inform the public about industry progress. ''At this stage, the public understands nobody is done,'' observed John Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council.
One concern for all U.S. sectors is public overreaction to the possibility of glitches because panic, in the form of major behavioral pattern changes, could lead to a ''self-fulfilling prophecy'' of economic instability. ''Our strategy, as we move through this next 14 months . . . is to be as transparent as we can about where we are, about what works, where we are struggling with problems, where we are in terms of remediation and what our contingency plans are,'' Koskinen said.
Adhering to that school of thought, Horvath announced that the Ferc Web site will be the ''one-stop shop'' for keeping up with the gas and oil industries' progress. Aggregate survey results, as well as those compiled individually by trade associations, were to be posted on the site (www.ferc.fed.us) last week, and future studies will follow at that location, Horvath explained. ''We're going to rely on the Ferc Web site as our primary method of informing the public,'' he said.
In another harbinger of greater information exchange on Y2K readiness, Koskinen noted that the Senate Judiciary Committee reported out to the full Senate an information-disclosure bill meant to facilitate the sharing of information without retribution. He said it is important ''to unlock the technical information and make it available for people who are late [to the conversion] game,'' particularly small and midsized organizations.
Of the 800 oil and gas companies that responded to the survey, 71% were labeled as small firms based on revenue, said Horvath, who added that the demographics reveal that smaller companies are concerned about the Y2K problem and are very engaged in dealing with it.
Companies were asked how they were addressing the essential, or ''mission-critical,'' areas within their hardware, software and embedded systems that keep supplies flowing. They also were queried about online testing of these functions and the communication of such efforts both within and outside the company.
The survey also touched on the ''supply-chain'' concept, which encompasses the gas and oil industries' relationships with the electric and telecommunications fields, explained Ron Quiggins, director of Shell Services International. According to the gas/oil working group's strategy, the sector will move toward a formal joint program with the electric and telecommunications segments to address overlapping Y2K concerns. ''The supply chain is a complex system where sometimes we're customers and sometimes we're suppliers,'' Quiggins assessed. ''We need to work well together.''
Meanwhile, gas officials continued to tout the inherent advantages their industry enjoys as it prepares for the calendar change. Gary Gardner, chief information officer at the American Gas Assn., pointed out that the industry is required by regulators and good business sense to plan for natural disasters that could affect the flow of gas. The industry is ''well-versed in what it takes to address issues that come up in an ice storm or a hurricane,'' he said.
But Gardner also declared there is no false sense of security within the field. While the companies have faced ice storms in the past, ''we've never handled a Y2K storm,'' he observed. The unique nature of this challenge has forced teams to develop new solutions for the potential computer bug, and Gardner predicted that as the sector moves toward the final stages of the remediation process next year, surveys and assessments will focus more heavily on contingency plans.
Terry Boss, vice president of environment, safety and operations at INGAA, noted that the gas distribution and transmission system ''has storage built in'' that will help limit complications. He went on to explain that the pipeline industry minimizes its dependence on electricity to run its operations. There is ''a lot of mechanical equipment out there,'' he said, noting that even fuel compression is natural-gas driven.
Robert Cave, executive director of the American Public Gas Assn., relayed his members' message that much of the heavily used mechanical and manual equipment in the field is not susceptible to the Y2K problem and will require little new investment for the transition. And the strong survey response from small companies should temper any concerns that they are lagging in compliance efforts, he remarked.
With two-thirds of the companies polled responding to this baseline survey, officials expressed satisfaction with the turnout. But Horvath said trade groups must strive to raise the response rate for the next assessment, due in February.
While encouraged by the findings of the survey, Koskinen cautioned that ''there's a race to be run here and we're making progress, but we've got a long way to go.'' During the session, Chairman James Hoecker announced that he had informed governors of the unified effort to assess readiness for the oil and gas industries ''in hopes that state government can join us where necessary and minimize any duplication of effort.''
Industry officials ''were impressed with the incredibly comprehensive nature of the plans,'' Horvath said. ''We are, we feel, on our way to being year-2000 ready well in time for that particular planned event.''
