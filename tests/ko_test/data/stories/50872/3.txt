DOT will not exempt several major carriers from a new rule BR The Department of Transportation will not exempt several major carriers from a new rule requiring them to allow travelers to leave the airplane if a tarmac delay exceeds three hours. Five carriers requested temporary exemptions. The airlines say the policy will force them to cancel flights, which will cause a bigger inconvenience for travelers. Apr 23, 2010
GPS-based air traffic control system BR A GPS-based air traffic control system could be delayed by computer glitches, Transportation Department Inspector General Calvin Scovel testified Wednesday before a House panel. The $2.1 billion computer upgrade has run into serious problems, including a failure to process radar information. Scovel said the problems might not be fixed in time to retire the current system on schedule. Apr 22, 2010
Privacy advocates question the millions of background checks conducted each year in the U.S. and Canada BR Some privacy advocates question the millions of background checks conducted each year by U.S. and Canadian officials accessing the other country's databases. In the first four months of this year, the U.S. has queried Canadian databases 1.4 million times, while Canada has accessed U.S. data 400,000 times. Officials say the 1999 arrest of Ahmed Ressam, an al-Qaida operative convicted of smuggling explosives across the border to bomb Los Angeles International Airport, is proof that sharing information is key to security. But some Canadian lawmakers are 'very nervous' about the open-database policy, and the ACLU calls it a 'dangerous practice that needs a tremendous amount of accountability.' Apr 22, 2010
Airlines are under-reporting cases of passengers who might be severely ill BR Some public health officials say airlines are under-reporting cases of passengers who might be severely ill with contagious diseases, as required by law. A USA TODAY investigation found paramedics are called to major airports to deal with illnesses far more often than airline passengers in the same area are reported to quarantine stations run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But a spokeswoman for the Air Transport Association says ambulance data do not provide a direct comparison and that flight crews lack the medical training to detect every sick passenger. Some health experts also question whether such reporting programs can help stop the spread of infectious disease. Apr 22, 2010
Iris scanner capable of identifying moving subjects from up to 10 feet away BR A New Jersey technology company says it has developed an iris scanner capable of identifying moving subjects from up to 10 feet away. Experts say upgraded biometric technologies such as Sarnoff Corp.'s 'Iris on the Move' system could have a big impact at airports and other high-security areas. Apr 20, 2010
US says global aviation security has improved markedly BR Global aviation security has improved markedly since Umar Abdulmutallab allegedly tried to blow up an airliner on Christmas Day, according to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. In meetings with leaders from Europe, Africa and South America, Napolitano says she has encountered 'remarkably little resistance' to greater coordination of security efforts. 'When al-Qaida and al-Qaida-related groups go at aviation, they're really going at the citizens of the world and the global aviation system,' she tells Fox News. As for the concern that terrorists may enter the system in a country that has not yet boosted security, Napolitano says there are 'processes in place that allow us to identify travelers who may be trying to avoid' highly secure airports.

Boston-area father says his first-grade daughter is on the federal no-fly list BR A Boston-area father says his first-grade daughter is on the federal no-fly list, endangering the family's long-planned trip to the Grand Canyon. Peter Mosher says he discovered the mix-up when he was unable to print a boarding pass for 6-year-old Allison, and the airline told him federal security rules were to blame. Mosher appealed to his senator for help, and aides called TSA at Boston Logan to request a review. But a TSA spokeswoman says airlines always have leeway for dealing with such circumstances, because children are not included on the no-fly list. 'If they observe a 6-year-old standing before them, they can forgo additional procedures,' Ann Davis notes. Apr 19, 2010
