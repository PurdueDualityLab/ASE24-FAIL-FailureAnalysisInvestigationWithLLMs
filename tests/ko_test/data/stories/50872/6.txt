SINGAPORE (ICIS news)--South Korea's [1]LG Chem will resume production at its 100,000 tonne/year butadiene rubber (BR) plant in Daesan on 12 May after it went down earlier this week due to a technical glitch, a company source said on Thursday.
'We shut down the plant on 4 May as there was some technical problem and plan to restart next week,' the source said but gave no other details.
LG Chem's unexpected week-long plant shutdown is expected to tighten supply and help bolster the BR price.
The company has hiked offers for June shipments to $3,300/tonne ([#x20ac]2,574/tonne) CFR (cost and freight) Asia, up $200/tonne from May fixtures.
($1 = [#x20ac]0.78)
