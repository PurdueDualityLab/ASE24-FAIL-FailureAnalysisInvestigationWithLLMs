GPS-based air traffic control system BR A GPS-based air traffic control system could be delayed by computer glitches, Transportation Department Inspector General Calvin Scovel testified Wednesday before a House panel. The $2.1 billion computer upgrade has run into serious problems, including a failure to process radar information. Scovel said the problems might not be fixed in time to retire the current system on schedule. Apr 22, 2010
Austin BR The Austin Police Department released 911 calls this week from the February plane crash into an IRS building in the Texas capital. Some callers worked in nearby buildings, and other callers were driving by the area. Pilot Joseph Stack III also set his empty house on fire the morning of the crash. Apr 20, 2010
Chicago O'Hare BR One of the most-used runways at Chicago O'Hare will be shortened by more than 3,000 feet to allow construction of a new runway, the FAA said Monday. The shortened runway will force a shift in some international takeoffs, as well as 1% to 2% of incoming aircraft. Apr 20, 2010
GE Aviation BR European airlines are pointing to recent test flights as evidence that jets can safely fly through European airspace, but experts say there is little data on the danger to jet engines from volcanic ash. GE Aviation, with some 20,000 commercial engines in use, says it sees only three cases per year of damage related to volcanic ash. The company is currently working with the FAA to analyze those cases, but safety experts say there is little basis for assessing risk. 'We don't know what the acceptable (ash) concentration level is,' says Bill Voss of the Flight Safety Foundation. 'There is no safe or unsafe.' Apr 20, 2010
Honeywell, Varig BR Honeywell inked a contract valued at $40 million over the life of the program to supply Varig with its full suite of safety avionics including its IntuVue weather radar, traffic alert and collision avoidance system, quantum line communications and navigation system, solid state flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder and emergency locator transmitter. Equipment will be included on 65 737-800s expected to begin delivering in 2013. Apr 22, 2010
Lockheed Martin BR NATO says it cannot expand on reports which claim that several Lockheed Martin F-16 fighters have been damaged by dust from the Icelandic volcanic eruption. A NATO source confirms that the comment was made by a US diplomatic official, but says the organisation does not know which operating nation, or nations, may have been involved. F-16s from several nations were in northern Europe late last week to participate in two large-scale exercises. Apr 19, 2010
New York JFK Airport BR US Dept. of Transportation yesterday denied requests from five US airlines for temporary exemptions from the new tarmac delay rule that takes effect April 29. JetBlue Airways, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines sought exemptions for their operations at New York JFK until the main runway, which is undergoing rehabilitation, reopens later this year. This was followed by requests from Continental Airlines for exemptions at New York LaGuardia and Newark and by US Airways at Philadelphia. 'Passengers on flights delayed on the tarmac have a right to know they will not be held aboard a plane indefinitely,' Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said. 'This is an important consumer protection, and we believe it should take effect as planned.' In denying the requests, DOT said airlines could minimize tarmac delays by rerouting or rescheduling flights at JFK 'to allow the airport's other three runways to absorb the extra traffic.' It also noted that 'it has the ability to take into account the impact of the runway closure and the harm to consumers when deciding whether to pursue enforcement action for failure to comply with the rule and the amount of a fine, if any, to seek as a result of noncompliance.'

Newport BR A man who was left quadriplegic after falling from the Cliff Walk, one of New England's best-known tourist attractions, can sue the city of Newport, Rhode Island's highest court ruled on Tuesday. Simcha Berman was on his honeymoon in August 2000 when he fell 29 feet onto rocks after mistakenly taking a path that led from the Cliff Walk. He accused the city and state of failing to properly inspect and maintain the oceanside walk, which winds along roughly 18,000 feet of shoreline and passes some of Newport's most spectacular Gilded Age mansions. A judge had earlier ruled in Newport's favor. But the state Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed the lawsuit to move forward, saying numerous injuries and deaths at the site over the years should have put the city on notice to repair the dangerous conditions. The justices rejected Newport's arguments that it had no duty to warn visitors of the site's potential hazards. Apr 21, 2010
Southwest Airlines, Boeing BR Southwest Airlines is performing a fleet-wide check of its baggage tugs after a runaway vehicle damaged the engines and fuselage of a Boeing 737-300 (N624SW) leaving the gate at Los Angeles International airport on 9 April. Investigators found a faulty safety switch on the errant tug and others at the US hub. Apr 24, 2010
