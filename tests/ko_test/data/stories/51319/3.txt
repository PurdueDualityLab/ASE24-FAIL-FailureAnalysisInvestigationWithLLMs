Jun. 15--CEDAR RAPIDS -- There was a long line at the Iowa Workforce Development office Monday morning after a computer glitch in the department's computer system forced some unemployment recipients to make a trip to the Cedar Rapids office to refile in person.
Normally, unemployment recipients either phone in or use a computer over the weekend to qualify for next week's benefits. But a glitch in the system wouldn't verify any information and instead told callers they would need to go to an office and refile.
'At first I panicked. Oh my God, what's wrong now? But it's happened on Memorial Day weekend. Somebody turned the phone system off, so it happens,' said Tammy Schnedler, who is unemployed and relies on unemployment benefits.
She added the mistake only cost her about a 15 minute wait at the Cedar Rapids office to take care of the problem.
Officials at Iowa Workforce Development in Des Moines said the glitch impacted only a portion of people who receive extended unemployment benefits. The computer problem was solved be fore people showed up at offices Monday morning, but it was too late to get the word out that the trip to refile for benefits was unnecessary.
One spokesman blamed the problem partly on a 30-year-old system.
Despite the glitch, benefits should arrive on time for recipients this week.
