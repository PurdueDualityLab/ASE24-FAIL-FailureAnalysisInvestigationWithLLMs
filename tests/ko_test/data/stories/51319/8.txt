The lines were longer than unusual at unemployment offices in Iowa thanks to a computer glitch.
Officials say a computer glitch in the Workforce Development system forced some unemployment recipients to make a trip Monday to the offices that they normally wouldn't make.
Typically, unemployment recipients must telephone or log onto a computer during a weekend to qualify for benefits the next week. But when they tried over the weekend, they were instructed to go to the office and file for benefits again.
Workers at offices were able to quickly separate people caught by the glitch from those at the office on other business and one recipient says she only had to wait 15 minutes to get the problem taken care of.
