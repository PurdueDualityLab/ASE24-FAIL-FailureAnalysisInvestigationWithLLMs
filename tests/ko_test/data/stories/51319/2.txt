State officials say a computer error caused thousands of Tennesseans to be told incorrectly that their unemployment benefits had run out.
The problem arose over the weekend when jobless people tried to call in to re-certify for payment, as they must do weekly.
The Tennessean reported about 20,000 people statewide found the system refused to accept their information and told them, in error, that their unemployment benefits had ended.
Tennessee Department of Labor and Workforce Development spokesman Jeff Hentschel said on Monday the computer glitch has been fixed, but thousands of checks would be delayed because callers had been unable to certify that they were eligible to receive them.
