TOKYO (AP)--For thousandsof American workers, the question of which aircraft Japan chooses to replace its aging fleet of fighter jets could mean their jobs.
The U.S. Air Force hasdramatically scaled back its orders of the stealthy F-22, so selling the costly fighter to an ally could be the only way to keep production from ending. Japan, which has expressed interest and is one of the few countries with deep enough pockets, could be the only realistic buyer on the horizon.
The U.S. Congress hasrepeatedly banned the sale or license of the F-22 "Raptor" to any foreign government. The latest attempt to repeal that ban was shot down in the U.S. Senate earlier this year.
But the risk of losingthousands of skilled jobs in the states of Georgia, Texas and California is raising pressure on Congress to export the fighter. Japan's interest could help turn the votes around.
During a summit with U.S.President George W. Bush in April, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe brought up the F-22 issue, according to Japanese media reports.
The U.S. Air Force,meanwhile, sent a dozen F-22s from America's Langley Air Force Base to Okinawa, Japan, in February for a three-month deployment. It was the first time the fighters had been sent on a mission outside of the United States.
Officials said the deployment provided training for the U.S. pilots, and one payoff was the discovery of a glitch in the fighter's software.
Lt. Gen. Bruce Wright,commander of U.S. forces in Japan, said the F-22 deployment was not part of a sales pitch. But the mission gave the Air Force a chance to show off its plane.
While at Okinawa thisspring, two F-22s and two F-15 Eagles took part in mock air battles with four F-4 Phantoms and four F-15s from Japan's Air Self-Defense Force. Japan is searching for a replacement for its F-4s, in service since 1973.
Japanese officials wereimpressed by the F-22's features, including a radar-evading stealth design and "supercruise," the ability to fly at supersonic speed for extended periods without using the jet engine afterburners, saving fuel and further reducing the likelihood of detection.
The F-22 was originallydesigned to counter the threat of advanced Soviet Su-27 fighters during the 1980s. Though that threat has diminished, Japan now is seeking to counter a Chinese fleet of those same fighters.
The F-22 program is amongthe largest for America's Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT), bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars a year. U.S.-based Boeing Co. (BA) produces the plane's wings, fuselage and other component systems. Pratt and Whitney and other contractors are also involved.
An about-face by the U.S.Air Force has put the program in jeopardy. After originally saying it would purchase 750 of the planes, the Air Force has cut that to just 183.
Lockheed employs 3,351F-22 workers at plants in Marietta, Georgia; Fort Worth, Texas and Palmdale, California, according to a U.S. Congressional Research Service report released last month.
Even Japan, however, has balked at the cost.
Pouring an increasingamount of its budget into ballistic missile defense, and constrained by a ceiling on defense expenditures of 1% of GDP, Tokyo's resources are limited. At $130 million a plane, the F-22 would not be an easy sell in the Japanese parliament.
"The F-22's capabilitiesare good, but it's too expensive," Fumio Kyuma, then the defense minister, said in December. "And the U.S. probably won't allow us to produce it under license."
Another option for Japanis the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which was designed by the U.S. as a multinational aircraft and can perform many of the same tasks as the F-22. Because of the overlap, the F-35 has become one of Raptor's rivals for funding.
Japan is also looking at the F-18, advanced F-15s and the Eurofighter Typhoon.
Defense Ministry officials say a decision isn't expected soon. [ 12-07-07 0924GMT ]
