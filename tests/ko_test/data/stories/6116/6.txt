WASHINGTON - Pricescharged by factories, farms and other producers recorded the largest increase in a year last month, but analysts dismissed it as a fluke and said faltering world demand will restrain inflation pressures.
The Producer Price Indexrose a seasonally adjusted 0.3 percent, pushed up by big increases for cars, vegetables and home-heating oil, the Labor Department said Thursday.
The increase came after astretch of eight declines over 10 months, however, and it did not prevent the inflation-wary Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates for a second time in less than three weeks to encourage businesses and consumers to keep borrowing and spending.
Economist Oscar Gonzalezof John Hancock in Boston labeled the September rise "an anomaly." Even with it, producer prices fell at a 0.8 percent annual rate for the first nine months of the year, compared with a 1.2 percent decrease for all of 1997.
"With more than half theworld's economies in the tank, inflation at the producer price level has all but vanished," Gonzalez said. "Economic weakness is so pervasive globally that the market would be stunned if inflation became a major concern any time soon."
Just after the report'srelease, long-term interest rates jumped in alarm on the bond market, then settled back as traders read the details. Later, after the Fed cut short-term interest rates, a mild rally in the stock market exploded.
The Dow Jones industrialaverage soared 331 points to 8,299, its highest close since Aug. 26, just before the collapse of the Russian ruble touched off seven weeks of turmoil on Wall Street.
Separate reports releasedThursday underscored the tone of weakness in the U.S. economy. The number of Americans filing first- time claims for unemployment benefits rose by 2,000 to 303,000 last week, still a low level. But continuing unemployment beneficiaries rose 22,000 to 2.2 million, suggesting more jobless people are having a harder time finding new jobs.
Also, the CommerceDepartment said inventories of unsold goods at U.S. businesses rose in August by 0.3 percent, and sales fell 0.2 percent.
Analysts dismissed the September producer price gain in part by a glitchin seasonally adjusting the data for autos and light trucks. After adjustment, car prices rose 2.2 percent, the largest increase in eight years. Before adjustment, they fell 0.4 percent.
