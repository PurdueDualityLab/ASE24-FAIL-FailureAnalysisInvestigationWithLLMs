Oct. 16--Detroit's new models drove September producer prices higher by 0.3 percent, the biggest gain in a year, but inflation is expected to remain well below the speed limit.
While seasonally adjusted prices of autos and light trucks accounted for three-quarters of the increase in the producer price index reported by the Labor Department, prices actually fell 0.4 percent before adjustment.
"This increase is a glitch and doesn't reflect how prices are really behaving," said Robert Dederick, economist and consultant to Northern Trust Co. "If you look at August for cars, you see that prices fell 2.2 percent before adjustment and 1.7 percent after adjustment."
The producer price index doesn't do as good a job tracking prices in the real economy as does the consumer price index, said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist for Norwest Corp. of Minneapolis. September's CPI will be released Friday.
"Mostly the PPI will pick up list prices rather than transaction prices," Sohn said. "Anecdotal evidence points to Detroit cutting prices."
Noting that so-called "pipeline" prices -- reflecting goods at the first and intermediate stages of production -- are still declining, Sohn said that deflation is a significant threat.
"The odds are about 50-50 that a global economic recession will cause deflation in the U.S.," he said.
He sees U.S. economic growth slowing to a rate of only 1 to 1.5 percent by midyear 1999, "which is very close to tipping over into a recession."
Dederick noted that there is still upward bias for the cost of services, but manufacturers can't raise prices. Faced with increased labor costs and slowing productivity, profit margins are beginning to give, he said.
"There are clear signs of a pullback in business spending which has been a key component of growth," he said. "
The question now, he said, is whether the economy "will have a soft landing or a hard landing."
After the Federal Reserve at midafternoon moved to cut short-term interest rates for the second time in a little over two weeks, Dederick said it was clear that the central bank was making sure that "the economy will not be dragged down by a credit squeeze."
