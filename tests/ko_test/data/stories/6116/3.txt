LARGE INCREASE IN PRODUCER PRICES DISMISSED AS AN ANOMALY

Prices charged byfactories, farms and other producers recorded the largest increase in a year last month, but analysts dismissed it as a fluke and said faltering world demand will restrain inflation pressures.
The Producer Price Indexrose a seasonally adjusted 0.3 percent, pushed up by big increases for cars, vegetables and home-heating oil, the Labor Department said yesterday.
The increase came after astretch of eight declines over 10 months, however, and it did not prevent the inflation-wary Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates for a second time in less than three weeks to encourage businesses and consumers to keep borrowing and spending.
Economist Oscar Gonzalezof John Hancock in Boston labeled the September rise "an anomaly." Even with it, producer prices fell at an 0.8 percent annual rate for the first nine months of the year, compared with a 1.2 percent decrease for all of 1997.
"With more than half theworld's economies in the tank, inflation at the producer price level has all but vanished," Gonzalez said. "Economic weakness is so pervasive globally that the market would be stunned if inflation became a major concern any time soon."
Just after the report'srelease, long-term interest rates jumped in alarm on the bond market, then settled back as traders read the details. Later, after the Fed cut short-term interest rates, a mild rally in the stock market exploded.
Separate reports releasedyesterday underscored the tone of weakness in the U.S. economy. The number of Americans filing first- time claims for unemployment benefits rose by 2,000 to 303,000 last week, still a low level. But continuing unemployment beneficiaries rose 22,000 to 2.2 million, suggesting more jobless people are having a harder time finding new jobs.
Also, the CommerceDepartment said inventories of unsold goods at U.S. businesses rose in August by 0.3 percent, and sales fell 0.2 percent. That was the second monthly sales decline and marked the first back-to-back drop since October and November of last year.
Economist Mark Vitner ofFirst Union Corp. in Charlotte, N.C., said the report suggested imports are piling up in inventory, particularly at the wholesale level. That could pressure U.S. factories into cutting production, he said.
Analysts dismissed the September producer price gain in part by a glitchin seasonally adjusting the data for autos and light trucks. After adjustment, car prices rose 2.2 percent, the largest increase in eight years. Before adjustment, they fell 0.4 percent.
"Auto prices already havebeen so deeply discounted that the end- of-the-year price reductions are merely a continuation of previous incentives. Therefore, prices rise after seasonal adjustment," said economist Donald Ratajczak of Georgia State University.
Without seasonal adjustment, the overall index for finished goods would have been unchanged.
In September, seasonallyadjusted energy prices overall inched 0.1 percent lower. Gasoline fell 2 percent but heating oil jumped 6.6 percent.
Food prices increased 0.4percent. Vegetables shot up 12.4 percent, and gains topping 30 percent were registered for squash, corn, grapefruit, potatoes and tomatoes.
Excluding volatile foodand energy costs, "core" prices rose 0.4 percent in September. They're up at 1.6 percent annual rate from January through September, compared with no change for all of 1997.
At earlier stages of theproduction process, prices fell 0.2 percent for intermediate goods and 1.6 percent for crude goods. An example of the three processing stages is clothing for finished, cloth for intermediate and cotton for crude.
