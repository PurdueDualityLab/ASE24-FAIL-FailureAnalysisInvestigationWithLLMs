Though there were few major glitches, it will take time for consumers who have problems receiving DTV signals to sort them out, said Neal Sabin, executive vice president of Wiegel Broadcasting, which owns WCIU-TV Chicago. 'There are still a lot of TVs out there that aren't fully converted and there are people having trouble getting signals,' he said. Viewers may find they need a better antenna or ultimately decide to subscribe to a pay-TV service, he said. Not everyone can afford cable, he said. 'And not everyone wants to have another bill even if they can afford it,' he said.
