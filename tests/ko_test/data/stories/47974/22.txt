Wolverton: In Bay Area, problems linger in shift to digital TV

The transition to digital television may be over, but not the problems it has caused for many Bay Area residents.
Since broadcasters switched off their analog signals June 12, I've been inundated with calls and e-mails from readers upset because they can no longer watch channels they were once able to get. The issues appear to be particularly acute here in the South Bay, but I've been hearing from readers throughout the area.
Their complaints and questions run the gamut from basic to complex. Some with older TVs still need to buy a converter box, for which $40 government coupons are still available. For those who have already taken that step or have a newer TV and are still having problems, here are some tips and information based on my contacts with analysts, local broadcasters and government officials.
You need to rescan. As part of the digital transition, many local stations changed the channel on which they broadcast their transmissions. KTVU's digital signal, for instance, switched from Channel 56 to Channel 44. To tune in those stations at their new locations, you'll need to have your converter box rescan for channels.
To rescan, activate the on-screen menu on your converter box or digital TV, generally by pushing a 'menu' button on your remote control. On the menu, you should see and select an option to 'auto-scan' or search for channels.
You may need to 'double rescan.' Some converter boxes government officials who identified the problem haven't said which ones have trouble tuning in digital stations that use the same channel on which they formerly broadcast analog signals. In the Bay Area, that means KGO, which moved its digital signal from Channel 24 to Channel 7, where it had its analog transmission. Due to a glitch, some converter boxes even when you set them to rescan won't recognize that Channel 7 now has a digital signal.
To tune in the new digital Channel 7, you'll need to reset your converter box's memory. The Federal Communications Commission recommends a double rescan.
First, unplug your antenna from your converter box. Then have the box to scan for channels. Next, unplug the box for at least a minute to wipe its memory. Plug the box back in and reattach it to your antenna. It should now recognize not only the stations you had before, but the new digital Channel 7 also.
Signals are subject to interference and distance. Even if you've done the scanning routine properly, you may not get particular channels, or some channels may cut in and out. As was the case with analog signals, digital ones can run into interference or be blocked by such things as fog and other weather conditions, planes, trains, tall buildings, walls within your home or hills and mountains.
Signals also get weaker the farther they have to travel and are more likely to be hampered by interference. That's a particular issue for South Bay viewers, who get most local stations from Sutro Tower in San Francisco, which is far enough away to cause problems.
You may need an outdoor antenna. If you've rescanned and still aren't getting digital channels, you may need to retire your old rabbit ears. In general, an outdoor antenna will do a much better job of tuning in weak channels or countering interference than an indoor one.
If you have an outdoor antenna and still have trouble getting a signal, you may need a signal amplifier. These devices typically cost $40 to $70. One type goes between the cable coming from your antenna and your television. Another type is mounted outside on your antenna.
Don't let 'em tell you no. Under federal rules, you have a right to use an outdoor antenna to receive local television signals, even if you are renting the property or subject to a homeowners agreement. Such agreements can restrict where you can install the antenna or how high it can be, but they generally can't prevent you from having one.
Beware of HDTV antennas. You don't need to have an 'HDTV' or 'digital television' antenna to get digital signals. Because digital transmissions are sent over the same VHF and UHF airwaves that were used for the old analog ones, you can use the same types of antennas as before.
Indeed, buying an 'HDTV' antenna can be a bad thing. Some 'HDTV' antennas will only get UHF signals. That made some sense before the transition, when nearly all stations nationwide were broadcasting their digital signals in the UHF band. It doesn't make sense now, though, since both KGO (Ch. 7) and KNTV (Ch. 11) are broadcasting in VHF.
Here today, gone tomorrow.In the next several months, the broadcasters that use Sutro Tower plan to upgrade their transmitters. In the near term, that means that they'll be using lower-powered transmitters or be broadcasting from points lower on the tower. As a result, some viewers who were able to get KGO, KTVU and other stations immediately after the transition may not get them in coming weeks.
The work started last week and isn't expected to be complete until the beginning of October. The good news is that all of the Sutro broadcasters should have significantly stronger signals by October. Additionally, KGO is considering asking for FCC approval to increase the power of its transmissions, which would expand its coverage area.
Help is available. If you are still having problems, you can get free help over the phone or at your home. The FCC call center which you can reach at 1-888-CALL-FCC (225-5322) can direct you to local service providers.
However, if you are looking for in-home help, be prepared to wait. The FCC won't say how long it's taking for local contractors to reach consumers, but some have had to wait a week already.
