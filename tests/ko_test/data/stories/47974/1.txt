Switch to digital TV left only a handful out of the picture

After years of warnings, the transition to digital television broadcasting came and went Friday, but local stations still are helping some consumers pick up the pieces .
One local station bore the brunt of viewers' questions about digital TV over the weekend. While WTKR 3 received 15 calls and WAVY 10 took 45, WVEC 13's 24-hour hot line has handled more than 540 calls since Thursday.
And they keep coming.
WVEC General Manager Jim Berman said most are asking only one question, and it doesn't surprise him because it's specific to his station, the local ABC affiliate.
In addition to switching to digital TV, he said, WVEC changed to a new formatting signal. This didn't affect the station or most viewers, but it required those who'd already activated their digital converter boxes to re-scan for the channel.
The station also experienced a minor digital TV-related programming glitch Saturday morning but has seen the call count drop each day since, Berman said.
The lack of calls caught WTKR's chief engineer Sam Barclay off guard. His station, the CBS affiliate, set up a five-person, 24-hour phone bank in anticipation of calls from confused viewers but cut it to one staffer when the calls didn't flood in.
"We've gotten more calls telling us how easy the switch was than we have from people having problems," he said.
The federal government mandated the switch to digital from analog TV broadcasting to free up spectrum for other lucrative uses such as high-speed data for mobile devices such as the iPhone and BlackBerry .
As of Friday, Hampton Roads was more prepared for the transition than most TV markets.
A survey by media tracking giant The Nielsen Company said only 13,000 households in the region were unprepared for the switch.
