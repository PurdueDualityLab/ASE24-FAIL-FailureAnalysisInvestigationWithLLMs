Friday TV shift: Will capital get with program?

Jun. 11--Somewhere in the Sacramento area on Friday, someone will turn on their TV and watch ... nothing.
The nationwide transition to digital television is here, finally, but despite a four-month delay, nearly 3 million U.S. households still are not ready for the changeover from analog signals. In the Sacramento area, the Nielsen Co. has estimated that more thans 64,000 households are unprepared for digital TV.
On top of that, federal officials said it's likely that millions of Americans will have poor reception, or none at all, once the switch is made.
Even so, the Obama administration, the Federal Communications Commission, the U.S. Department of Commerce and TV stations coast to coast are committed.
"With all that digital television offers to consumers and society, it is essential that all Americans get prepared for the transition," said FCC Chairman Michael Copps.
In the Sacramento area, some consumers who were unprepared when the switch was originally scheduled in February said they are ready for Friday -- for better or worse.
"I was one of those who procrastinated and was totally unprepared back in February," said Sacramentan Gary Wilkes. "I got a reprieve, and now I'm ready to go. Now that I have my converter box for my old upstairs TV, I'm actually kind of excited about Friday."
In south Placer County, Melinda Smith was awaiting assistance and hoping for the best.
"I kept fighting it and waiting and wondering why this had to happen, but I finally realized I had no choice and went out and bought the equipment," she said. "My son-in-law is supposed to come over Friday and hook it all up, but I'm really nervous about it."
The logistics of Friday's changeover are complex. It's not a matter of one person throwing a giant switch for the whole country.
The U.S. Commerce Department explained that Friday will involve a "rolling transition," with U.S. stations locking into digital Friday anywhere from 12:01 a.m. to 11:59 and 59 seconds that night.
Individual stations, which will make the switch based on local times, had to notify the FCC about their plans, prompting the Commerce Department to draw up a scorecard of scheduled changeover times: 175 stations plan to switch between midnight and 6 a.m., 200 between 6 a.m. and noon, 152 from noon to 6 p.m. and 447 between 6 p.m. and 11:59:59 p.m.
About half of the nation's 1,760 full-power TV stations -- mostly in sparsely populated areas -- have already cut their analog signals.
Some Sacramento stations will convert as early as 9 a.m. Russell Postell, president and general manager of KXTV (Channel 10) in Sacramento, said his station will switch at the last second.
Before the switch and even during it, KXTV will have on-air help for viewers.
"We're airing a special edition following the news Friday night, from 11:30 to 12:06 (a.m. Saturday), and we'll have information all day on the DTV transition," Postell said. "We'll have seven engineers available at various times of the day, and our phone system will be linked to their (cell) phones to provide people with as much help as possible."
Other local stations said they will likewise beef up in-studio phone banks, online help and special Friday programming to explain the switch and have personnel available to answer questions.
Postell said he's particularly concerned about viewers getting two important messages: antenna positioning and a required "rescanning" once a converter box is installed. On TVs with old "rabbit ears" antennas, a converter box is necessary to convert the analog signal to digital.
Antenna positioning will be key to overcome "ghosting" -- a poor screen image caused when a TV signal arrives at the receiver via more than one path -- and signals disrupted by topography or obstacles surrounding a household.
Because some digital stations will move to different frequencies on Friday, consumers with converter boxes should rescan to pull in all available stations. This can be done through the converter box set-up menu.
Some households far from the source of a digital signal may receive no signal at all.
Despite a push by local, state and federal officials, Sacramento-area viewers have been slow to get coupons and get ready for the all-digital age.
According to figures released Wednesday by the Nielsen Co., Sacramento went from being the 10th least-ready U.S. market to the third least-ready on a percentage basis. The 64,238 area households not ready for the switch is an improvement of about 4,000 from two weeks ago, but the current 4.59 percent of unprepared households -- out of about 1.4 million in the area -- trails only Albuquerque/Santa Fe, N.M. (7.58 percent) and Dallas/Fort Worth (5.84 percent). The nationwide number is 2,805,250 unprepared households, or 2.45 percent.
Federal authorities acknowledge that problems related to terrain, signal strength, technology and confused consumers will be numerous. But they say Friday's transition must be completed before turning to fix the glitches.
For now, consumers experiencing problems with Friday's transition are being asked to call the FCC's DTV hotline at (888) 225-5322.
Beyond that, officials say they'll try to get all Americans set up with DTV, including helping viewers who still need converter boxes get federal coupons good for $40 off the cost of the device. Boxes sold at electronics stores cost around $60 each, on average.
The nationwide DTV transition originally was set for Feb. 17, but just before the deadline and at the urging of the Obama administration, Congress postponed the switch.
At that time, an estimated 6.5 million U.S. households were not ready, and many who had received $40 coupons for converter boxes had let the coupons expire. To complicate things, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration overseeing the coupons had hit its $1.34 billion funding limit.
Since then, funds have been freed up by expired coupons and other adjustments, and numerous local outreach programs directed coupons into the hands of consumers, particularly the poor and minorities. Coupons will be available through July 31.
"In the past four months, we have cut the unpreparedness numbers by more than half," said Parita Shah, Commerce Department press secretary. "... We are continuing our aggressive outreach efforts."
Commerce officials said the coupon rush accelerated on June 1, ramping up to 100,000 applications per day. In the months before that, only two days saw that average.
Sales associates at Best Buy and Target stores in the Sacramento area said Wednesday that sales of converter boxes picked up last weekend, and the pace has remained strong all week. Great deals abound in stores and online, with special offers reducing the cost of a box to $5 to $10 when a $40 federal coupon is used.
Even with exhaustive planning, communications experts have varying opinions of how things will go on Friday.
KXTV's Postell said he's confident that "it's going to be fine. It reminds me a little bit of Y2K," the millennium computer date changeover that went off with relatively few problems despite grave predictions prior to Jan. 1, 2000.
