Reprogram your TV each month during transition to digital

A missive arrived from my cable company, Mediacom, announcing that not only would it continue providing analog channels, but it would generously include more than 14 new digital HD channels in my basic/family package at no extra charge. Of course, a digital TV with a built-in digital QAM (this is a technical acronym) cable tuner is required. Virtually all digital TVs incorporate one. However, the converter boxes you buy with the coupon usually do not include a digital QAM tuner. If you have an HDTV without the appropriate tuner, Mediacom will gladly loan you a tuner for one year, after which it will bill you $1.99 per month.
What truly thrilled me is that Mediacom now will carry WILL's two additional digital channels, WILL Create and WILL World, in addition to the primary PBS channel. Mediacom also added WBUI, the CW Network channel, in HD. It now provides all the networks in its new "700" tier.
Whether you subscribe to Mediacom or Comcast, during this transition period, you should reprogram your TV once a month. Dust off the instruction manual and read the instructions for the initial setup, as if you just brought the set home from the store.
If you own a digital TV, only memorize the digital channels. Let the TV run through its initial setup of locating stations and placing them in memory. If you use an antenna and cable, tell the TV to run both setups. Unless you occasionally run the initial setup reprogramming, when the cable company shifts channel assignments, your TV may no longer tune those stations.
Off-the-air digital reception might improve after next week's final transition to digital, although not necessarily immediately. When stations were required to simulcast analog and digital signals, the new digital antenna generally was placed below the analog antenna on the tower. There also was the possibility of some interaction between the two antennas. Some stations may opt to remove the old analog antenna and move the digital antenna up on the tower, or optimally reorient it, which they could not do while still transmitting in analog. Don't count on an overnight improvement, but I would expect some subtle to modest improvements on some stations over the next three months. This whole affair also is something of a learning curve for broadcast engineers.
Let me provide an example. The chief engineer of my radio station in Chicago is intelligent and dedicated. He has spent his life trying to make sure that the station has the best sound and signal. Recently, our parent company suggested that our transmitter cohabit with their TV transmitter, which would save space and rent atop the Sears Tower. That required a new, smaller transmitter. Since the HD (hybrid digital) radio age is upon us, which unlike TV, does not require buying a new radio, our engineer searched for the best available transmitter. He found a company in Maine that designed and manufactures one of the most advanced FM transmitters in the world. This transmitter uses no vacuum tubes (until very recently, most high power radio transmitters used at least one tube) and is entirely software controlled. It has no knobs, dials or switches.
As you might guess, within a month of installation the transmitter experienced periodic glitches and failures because of software bugs. We've had to turn it off and reboot it, just like a misbehaving PC. The manufacturer is still pondering the problem.
In a few months when the software problems are fixed, this could be one of the finest transmitters ever built, but it will take time until it operates at its full potential. It certainly has legally extended my station's range. Driving home to Champaign from Chicago, I hear a clear signal as far as Onarga. Formerly, the signal faded just past Pontiac. One night, I was able to listen as far as Paxton, which was amazing.
Although FM radio and TV transmission are different, both not fully mature new technologies.
