Q: What if I see snow instead of Regis and Kelly?A: It could be lots of things. Do you have a TV with a digital tuner? If not, did you buy and hook up a digital converter box? Do you have the right antenna? It needs to cover both the UHF and VHF spectrums. If you haven't done any of these things, you can start by going to www.dtv.gov to learn more about the digital transition.
Q: Why is the government doing this to me?A: Several reasons. The move to digital signals - they tend to be more efficient than analog signals - will declutter the airwaves, freeing up space for other uses. For example, some of the airwaves are being set aside to build better communication systems for police and fire departments. Other chunks of vacated space could be used by wireless carriers to offer things like live TV on your cell phone. There also is the prospect of more widely available wireless broadband Internet access.
Q: Why were some of my channels missing when I woke up this morning?A: You may need to do a re-scan for new channels. Some converter boxes will do it automatically, but some need to be told when to do a scan. Experts suggest doing a re-scan Friday morning because some stations will be moving around the broadcast spectrum. Your converter box may need help finding them again.
They suggest doing a scan when you set up your converter box for the first time and whenever you move your antenna around. And with new stations coming online periodically, it's not a bad idea to do a re-scan every few months.
Q: Can I still get coupons to help pay for a digital converter box?A: You are in luck. The government has taken procrastinators into account with its coupon program. Consumers have until July 31 to put in a request at 1-888-225-5322.
Q: Will my VCR still work?A: Yes, but not without some help, according to www.DTVAnswers.com. The analog tuner in your VCR won't be able to pick up digital broadcasts. The input to the VCR must be connected to the output of the DTV converter box. Then you have to set the converter box tuner to the channel you want to record. For more information on how this works, check out this website: www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/converterbox_vcr.html
Q: I'm having trouble; is help still available?A: Yes, you have several options, including some companies hired by the Federal Communications Commission to offer free in-home installations. Local broadcast stations also are offering varying levels of support through phone banks and in at least one case, in-home assistance.

Q: Why isn't my battery-powered television working?
A: If you have a battery-powered TV for camping or emergencies, you'll also need a battery-powered digital converter box.
Q: I get the big stations; where is my local religious station?A: Many low-power stations - they tend to carry religious or educational material - will continue broadcasting analog signals. Make sure your digital converter box has what's called an analog pass-through switch.
Q: Nothing seems to work. What can I do to fix this?A: Unfortunately, it looks like there will be some people who stand to lose TV reception on Friday. While the digital signal is considered better than analog, it has some weaknesses. It doesn't travel quite as far, can't penetrate buildings as well and has trouble navigating some terrain. You can try a more powerful antenna, but may have to pay for satellite or cable service.
Friday will be one of the bigger days in the history of television. At 12:01 a.m., most local TV stations will terminate the analog signals they've been broadcasting for decades as the government-mandated switch to digital television finally happens. Originally planned for Feb. 17, the deadline was shifted to allow more consumers time to get ready for this change. For the vast majority of television viewers, including those who subscribe to cable or satellite TV, the change is expected to be a non-event. There are more than 20,000 in St. Louis not ready for the change. And there could, of course, be some unexpected glitches during the day. So here are a few questions and answers to help folks navigate the digital transition.
