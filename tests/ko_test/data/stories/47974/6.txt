Analog TV becomes a thing of the past

Television's digital era became official just before midnight as the last holdouts broadcasting in old-fashioned analog transmissions were required to shut off their signals.
Tulsa's three remaining analog holdouts --
KTUL (ABC) channel 8, KJRH (NBC) channel 2 and KOKI (Fox) channel 23
-- shut off their signals early Friday and say the transition thus far was smooth.
"We have a bunch of people in here to man the phones, but so far the number of calls has been light," said Pat Baldwin, president and general manager of KTUL.
Friday was the last day television stations were allowed to broadcast analog signals to television viewers. Congress had given stations years to prepare for the change.
Tulsa was targeted by the Federal Communications Commission as one of the nation's "hot spots" where the greatest number of people were considered unprepared for the digital switch.
As of May 24, the FCC estimated that about 24,000, or 4.69 percent, of area households were not ready, meaning they received their television via antennas and did not have televisions or converter boxes to receive digital signals.
Digital signals allow more stations to be broadcast in a region and provide a clearer picture and better sound. But the transition requires users with older television sets to get a converter box to pick up the digital signals.
All of Tulsa's stations have been broadcasting both digital and analog signals for years, and several other area stations shut off their analog signals in February.
At KTUL, the majority of the calls Friday were from viewers just setting up their digital converter boxes, Baldwin said.
KOKI turned off its analog signal and reported no problems in the hours that followed, said Holly Allen, the station's general manager.
"It's been very smooth. We've had about a dozen calls," she said.
"I honestly think that the broadcasting community has done an excellent job getting the word out on this," she said.
The government offered $40 coupons for those affected to buy converter boxes, and about 164,000 coupons were redeemed in the Tulsa area.
At Video Revolution, an electronics retailer, general manager Joel Reed said he had not noticed a rise in people buying boxes in recent days, but Friday the store had several people calling in and asking for help setting up the boxes.
"Most people just need to remember to reprogram their boxes to get all the digital signals," Reed said.
KJRH made its transition at 9 a.m. Friday.
Station manager Michael Vrabac said there were a few glitches with a satellite and cable company that needed to adjust signals, but that only took a few minutes to fix.
For those who do try to tune in to KJRH's old analog signal, the station is playing a nine-minute video from the FCC instructing viewers on how to get a digital signal.
"I would say that if we don't get a lot of calls this evening, I don't anticipate we'll get very many more calls at all," Vrabac said.
