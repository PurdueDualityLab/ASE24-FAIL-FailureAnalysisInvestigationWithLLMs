EVERYONE in the Granada TV region must ensure their TV is ready to receive a digital signal from this autumn - but don't expect the technology to be glitch-free.
From November 4, only digital TVs or those with a set-top box will be able to receive the television signal for terrestrial TV.
A BBC fact-sheet reveals digital TV 'gives better quality pictures and sound than analogue TV and does not suffer from the same kinds of problems.
'You will not get a fuzzy or 'snowy' picture, 'ghosting', hiss or crackling, for example. However, this does not mean digital reception is problem-free.'
The BBC says the picture can break up, freeze or pixelate. Many reception difficulties are the result of a weak signal that the digital receiver cannot decode.
However, the signal strength will be increased after switchover. This cannot happen at the moment as it could interfere with the analogue signal.
Other potential issues are:  picture and sound out of synchronisation  no picture or sound  interactive features (via red button) not working  channels missing Any digital r eceiver - set-top box or digital TV - has a micro-processor and software at its heart and, like a computer, it can suffer from occasional glitches. Often, simply restarting or 'rebooting' is all that is needed.
To reboot the receiver, unplug it from the mains and leave it unplugged for about 10 minutes. Plug the receiver back into the power supply and this will reboot the software.
If channels or features are still missing, the next step to try is to rescan to find all the channels.
On-screen messages about the digital switchover are now appearing on analogue TV channels in the North West.
In six months' time, the Winter Hill transmitter group, which serves the Granada TV region, will start switching to digital television.
