Jun. 13--Bye-bye, bunny ears. Hello DTV.
Friday marked the beginning of a new era in broadcast television as local stations here in Western New York and across the nation shut off their analog signals and began exclusively broadcasting digitally.
It meant that anyone who was still watching their TV using antenna reception without a digital converter box couldn't watch their local news or favorite network shows Friday. Folks who rely on cable or satellite were unaffected.
All of the Buffalo stations that switched Friday fielded calls from viewers following the analog shut off, mostly from people having problems getting their converter boxes working. None of the callers reported being caught off guard by the switch.
At 9 a. m., channels 4 (WIVBTV), and 23 (WNLO-TV) turned off their analog signals for good and began exclusively broadcasting in digital.
"We've had about 50 calls so far," said Dennis Majewicz, director of engineering at Channel 4 and 23 shortly after 3 p. m. Friday, six hours after the two stations went digital. "Most of these calls are from people who need a little help with reception, how to get the converter program working. We had a couple of people looking for [converter box] coupons. That's about it."
Channel 2 (WGRZ-TV) also switched over at 9 a. m., however it decided to keep its analog signal up and running in what the station is referring to as a "night light" mode. The analog signal will stay up another two weeks and will broadcast repeatedly a 16-minute public service announcement about DTV and converter boxes.
"So far, so good," said Scott Semson, engineering supervisor at Channel 2, which received a couple of dozen calls during the afternoon from viewers looking for help with hooking up their converter boxes. "I think the majority of the audience knew it was coming and was pretty well prepared."
Next up at 1 p. m. was Channel 7 (WKBW-TV). Channel 7 engineers got about 30 calls during the day and reported no major problems from viewers, though a couple did grumble about the cost of having to buy a converter box.
Channel 29, the local Fox affiliate, went solely digital in February and Channel 17, the PBS station WNED-TV, made the switch in April.
The federally mandated analog shutoff was aimed at offering a clearer picture for viewers, as well as opening up airwaves for emergency responders, wireless broadband and TV services for cell phones.
At least 2 million households across the country are believed to have been unprepared for Friday's big switch, down from 7 million in January. It's not known locally how many Western New Yorkers were watching static Friday, but in January there were about 40,000 analog- only viewers in the Buffalo market.
In May, the Federal Communications Commission ran a digital television "soft test" to get people ready for Friday's switch-over. The federal agency received 55,000 calls during the test to its help line. Of those, 112 calls came from the Buffalo media market.
To help analog viewers make the switch, the FCC has peppered local stations with ads about the change. It has offered $40 coupons to help offset the cost of converter boxes, which cost anywhere from $40 to $60.
Thursday, the Commerce Department reported a last-minute rush for the coupons. It received more than 300,000 requests, nearly four times the daily average for the past month.
Friday, the FCC's 24-hour technical support help line was flooded with calls. As of 2 p. m., it had received more than 122,000 calls. Anyone experiencing problems can call the FCC, which is operating a 24- hour hotline, at (888) CALL-FCC.
