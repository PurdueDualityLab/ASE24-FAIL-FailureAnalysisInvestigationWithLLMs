Officials Upbeat About Historic DTV Shift

Television makes history at midnight. When 974 broadcasters across the country begin turning off their analog signals early Friday morning, with shut-offs continuing throughout the day, they will mark the end of an era that began with the U.S. debut of TV technology at the 1939 World's Fair in New York.
After more than two decades of planning, a four-month delay imposed by Congress this year and billions spent in federal and private dollars on outreach and converter box coupons, officials finally think the digital switchover is under control.
The FCC has dispatched 200 staffers to trouble spots, deployed 4,000 operators to man its hotline around the clock through Monday, and established more than 500 walk-in centers and DTV clinics.
Yet no one in charge is predicting a trouble-free transition. 'We know there will be some disruption over this weekend and the coming weeks, but it won't be for our not trying,' said William Lake, the FCC's DTV transition coordinator, during a briefing today in which officials involved with planning were largely upbeat.
'We are cautiously optimistic that we will be able to meet demand,' added Deputy Assistant Commerce Secretary Anna Gomez, referring to coupons being issued by her department.
'I can confidently tell you that today we're ready,' added Paul Karpowicz, incoming TV Board chairman for the National Association of Broadcasters.
Nielsen Media Research estimates that 2.8 million households remain unprepared -- half the level from February, when the switchover originally was set to occur. The NAB, which insists Nielsen data is flawed, issued survey results today indicating that only 1.75 million households are unready.
Government officials caution that their toughest work lies ahead, as problems arise with antennas, converter boxes and reception, or in extreme cases, viewers discover blank TV screens. FCC-affiliated contractors and volunteers can accommodate up to 200,000 house calls to provide technical assistance.
Among the glitches that even conscientious consumers will face are reception woes. WETA-TV, the main PBS station serving the Washington region, has warned viewers in outlying counties they won't receive its digital signal, which does not travel as far as its analog one -- a problem that will occur nationwide.
Lake remains concerned about 49 'hot spots' with large concentrations of elderly, low-income and minority residents where preparations are lagging. 'Many of them are in the southwest -- Houston, Albuquerque, Los Angeles,' he said.
Another is the Brownsville, Texas, market along the U.S.-Mexico border, where William Jorn, general manager at NBC affiliate KVEO-TV, estimates that at least 5 percent of residents still rely on analog.
That's due to heavy viewership by Spanish-speaking families on the U.S. side of Mexican stations that don't carry warnings about the switchover. 'We've done everything we possibly could do' to prepare residents, Jorn said in a phone interview, adding that some will continue watching Mexican analog broadcasts or be forced to scramble to upgrade their equipment.
Many of the problems that prompted Congress to extend the deadline to Friday, after the Obama administration's recommendation of a delay, have been ameliorated. A waiting list that reached 4.2 million requests for converter box coupons has been cleared, thanks to an emergency infusion of $650 million from Congress.
Commerce Department data released Wednesday indicates that 60 million vouchers, worth $40 each, have been requested, and nearly 31 million redeemed, with a noticeable spike in applications this week.
