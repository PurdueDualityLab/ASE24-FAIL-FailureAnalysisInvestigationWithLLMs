End of DTV Switch Had Few Hiccups, Stations and FCC Say

The conclusion of full-power broadcasters' analog shutoff was generally smooth, our survey of broadcasters in most of the FCC's 'hot-spot' markets found. The U.S. DTV transition was marred only by some stores running out of antennas and viewers in parts of big cities losing reception, said station executives and commission officials. They said there was little viewer confusion Friday, when the last stations switched, and through the weekend.
When some consumers turned on sets after the DTV transition, they needed to rescan digital converter boxes or buy new antennas to get all digital channels in their market, representatives from stations in 30 of the FCC's 49 priority markets said. 'It's looking more like Y2K than the Bay of Pigs,' FCC Commissioner Jonathan Adelstein told reporters Saturday. Acting Chairman Michel Copps said, 'Job One in the coming days and weeks is to restore service to the consumers who still may be experiencing difficulties.'
KLTS-TV Shreveport, La., which lost all service during the switch (CED June 15 p1), restored it at 10 p.m. Friday, said Fred Christiansen, the assistant engineering director at Louisiana Public Broadcasting. By Monday, the station was at full power, he said. A 'handful of stations' were down, including one in Memphis where a tornado struck, said Bob Ratcliffe, the acting FCC Media Bureau chief. 'We certainly saw some stations that had problems.'
That was an exception, our survey found. 'Things have gone very smoothly,' said a spokesman for CBS, the owner of stations in 11 hot-spot markets including Boston, Denver, Miami and New York. 'I have not heard about there being any problems.' At Tribune, with stations in Philadelphia, Indianapolis, Seattle and other priority markets, 'there were minimal issues,' a spokesman said. There were 'mostly a lot of questions' from viewers in places like New York, he added.
Scripps, with hot-spot stations in six markets, got 'lots of questions' from viewers, including more than 2,300 calls in Cincinnati, and was able to help most callers, a company spokesman said. 'The switch went pretty much as expected, with no major problems,' and 'all in all it went better than we expected,' he added. In Milwaukee, there were 'no big surprises,' said General Manager Jan Wade of Hearst- Argyle's WISN, an ABC affiliate. Most who called WISN 'asked about converter box set up, scanning channels and antenna strength,' she said.
Chicago and San Francisco were two hot spots where some viewers couldn't see in digital all the channels that they could get in analog, said FCC and broadcast officials. No cable or satellite-TV company was completely unable to take stations' digital feed, though there were some brief problems, they said. Some consumer electronics retailers ran out of antennas, but nearby stores had them, FCC officials said.
In Chicago, residents of some high-rises had problems getting digital signals, and the FCC is working with stations there to adjust signals, said an agency official. Some spots in the San Francisco area, including the Oakland hills and the 'far reaches' of the market, couldn't see one or two channels, said General Manager Valari Staab of KGO, an ABC affiliate owned by Disney. 'Better antennas are helping in some areas.' All the market's stations switched to digital without problems, 'and the call volume has been steady but not overwhelming' from viewers, she added.
Though there were few major glitches, it will take time for consumers who have problems receiving DTV signals to sort them out, said Neal Sabin, executive vice president of Wiegel Broadcasting, which owns WCIU-TV Chicago. 'There are still a lot of TVs out there that aren't fully converted and there are people having trouble getting signals,' he said. Viewers may find they need a better antenna or ultimately decide to subscribe to a pay-TV service, he said. Not everyone can afford cable, he said. 'And not everyone wants to have another bill even if they can afford it,' he said.
The commission had trouble keeping up with Friday's single-day record of more than 317,000 calls to 888-CALL-FCC, officials said. Commissioner Robert McDowell had to wait 20 minutes when he called, and 22 percent of callers hung up before speaking with an operator, he said. Not everyone was besieged by calls. Several stations said they got few. Block Communications' WDRB Louisville, a Fox affiliate that hasn't changed digital signals since 2006, got 13 calls Friday through Sunday, Chief Engineer Gary Schroder said. By midday Friday, 'The only call I received was our owner,' Schroder said. 'He was concerned, and I put his mind to rest.' -- Jonathan Make
DTV Transition Notebook ...
Three days into the digital switchover, we saw no evidence Monday that retailers were dumping coupon-eligible DTV converter boxes. There were signs, however, that some were scaling back their assortments. Wal-Mart pricing on its boxes 'varies by store,' its e-commerce site said, suggesting a departure from the uniform $49.87 that the chain has priced the RCA and Magnavox brands of boxes for months. But the Wal-Mart store we checked in East Meadow, N.Y., had 22 units of the Magnavox TB110MW9 analog-passthrough box on display at the same $49.87 price as before. We counted 33 units of the TB110MW9 at Wal-Mart in White Plains, N.Y., also at $49.87. A nearby Target had six RCA STB7766C boxes and 20 Apex DT250s, all at $49.99. About 60 Apex DT250s were on shelves at a nearby Best Buy, also tagged at $49.99. Best Buy's house-brand Insignia converters were no longer available, a salesman told us. Kmart's White Plains outlet was sold out of the RCA and Zenith boxes it had carried at $49.99. A clerk there told us she didn't know whether the store would re-stock the products and referred us to the RadioShack outlet next door. That store had only four converter boxes left, all the DigitalStream DTX9950 at $54.99. Its manager likewise told us he didn't know whether the store would restock. Online, the e-commerce store SolidSignal.com had five models of converter boxes available, priced from $41.75 for the Channel Master CM 7000 to $53.99 for EchoStar's DTVPal. At its peak, SolidSignal.com carried about two dozen models of converter boxes. -- JB, SB, PG
