Digital TV change headache for some

Digital television is all about a better way to view TV -- a crisper picture and more channels. "It's very good, the picture," said Oakland resident Skip Sahlin, a retired baker who installed a digital converter box and a new antenna on his analog set several months ago. "I'm really satisfied with what I've got. I don't have cable but I'm able get so many more channels. Now, I'm in the digital age."
But some local residents with analog sets that pull in signals with antennas who went digital before the upcoming June 12 digital TV deadline are experiencing frustrations with the new technology. In the Bay Area, about 8.3 percent of households rely on over-the-air broadcasts that require antennas.
Once the deadline hits, most TV broadcasters will turn off their analog signals and only transmit digital signals. In order to receive a digital signal, viewers have three choices: subscribe to a cable, satellite or telephone company TV provider; have a TV or DVD recorder/player with a built-in digital tuner or use a converter box and VHF/UHF antenna with an analog set.
The third option is where some viewers are running into problems that include dropped channels and glitches with their VCRs.
Digital signals -- which are already being sent out by broadcasters -- can provide a very good picture, but the signals can be blocked by hills, buildings and weather conditions. An antenna that draws in both VHF (channels 2 to 13) and UHF (channels 14 and above) may help.
While a TV with an antenna can receive a weak analog signal (the picture will come in but look snowy) a digital signal is all or nothing. When it is not received a viewer will see only a blank screen and the message "no signal."
"That's the so-called digital cliff effect. There can be an issue," said Mark Wigfield, spokesman for the Federal Communications Commission, which is overseeing the transition.
Some time after the June 12 deadline, many local broadcasters are expected to adjust their digital signals by either making them stronger or placing them higher on transmitter towers, he said. So people with analog sets may want to wait until after the deadline passes before investing in a new antenna. The digital transformation is expected to result in 89 percent of broadcast stations reaching more viewers while 11 percent will reach fewer viewers, according to the FCC.
But for now, some people with analog TVs who have already installed digital boxes are feeling like they are getting the short end of the stick. (People with pay TV services are not expected to experience the kind of reception problems that some antenna TV viewers have reported with digital signals.)
"It's not so good, let's put it this way. (Channel) 2 we can get but it's kind of spotty. It gets pixilated and it breaks up then comes back again. (Channels) four, five and seven we don't get at all," said Moraga resident John Schick, a retired engineer who figures the Oakland hills are blocking digital signals to his home. "Analog we could get fine," he said.
Last year, when the digital TV public information campaign swung into gear, much was said about how analog TVs would need a converter box, but little was said about the need for a VHF/UHF antennas. Now that message is getting out.
"When it first started, everyone said just get a converter box and everything is fine," said Phavia Kujichagulia, a manager at the DTV Assistance Center in Oakland.
When Redwood City resident Veronica Breuer installed a converter box, she was not able to program her VCR to make future recordings. Not only that, but channels came and went. "Depending wherever I moved in the room, it would break up," said the retired librarian.
Reception improved when she replaced an indoor antenna with an outdoor antenna, but Breuer was still not able to record shows on her VCR. Theoretically, it is possible for a converter box to work with VCRs to record timed programs. The VCR input must be connected to the converter box output. Also, the converter box tuner has to be set to the channel to be recorded. Not quite as easy as before.
Breuer ended up paying about $300 for a DVD/VCR recorder/player with a built-in digital tuner. The device brings in the channels that she was not receiving before and allows future DVD recordings of TV shows.
"It's not exactly a perfect solution but it's better than nothing," Breuer said.
So is the picture better than what she got with analog?
"Oh, I guess it is a bit better," said Breuer, adding that she is also able to get more channels than she did before. "To be fair, I am getting some benefit but was it worth it to go through what I've gone through in the last couple months and the resources and amount of energy expended and frustrations I had?"
