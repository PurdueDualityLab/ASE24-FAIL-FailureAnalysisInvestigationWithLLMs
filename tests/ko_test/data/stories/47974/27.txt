IS YOUR TV READY FOR FRIDAY?

Say goodbye to that snowy reception you get from your television with the rabbit ears every time you watch The Tonight Show.
Like Jay Leno, it's history.
As of Friday, TV programming will be all-digital on all stations all the time. The old, not-so-trusty analog version is toast -- and it's estimated that millions of American TV viewers without the right technology could be left in the dark.
Despite more than $2 billion spent by Washington to ease the transition to digital TV, the latest survey by The Nielsen Co. indicates that as of the end of May, more than 10 percent of the 114 million households that have television sets are either completely or partly unprepared.
"We are much better prepared than we were in February, when the original transition was to have occurred, but there will nonetheless be significant disruptions," said Michael Copps, head of the Federal Communications Commission.
About 3 million homes that do not subscribe to cable or satellite TV services are totally unprepared for the transition and will lose their reception, according to Nielsen. An additional 9 million homes that subscribe to cable or satellite services and have spare television sets -- typically in bedrooms and kitchens -- that are not connected to any service also are expected to lose reception. The conversion does not affect cable or satellite distribution.
Officials say that millions more who thought they were prepared are likely to experience poor reception or improperly connected antennas.
The elderly, low-income citizens and those who don't speak English are among those experiencing difficulty in preparing for the switch, said Bernita Smith, digital television coordinator with the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights Education Fund.
There have been some unforeseen glitches, Smith said. Residents of one group home in Atlanta, for example, have had a hard time in obtaining government-provided discount coupons for digital converter boxes because they're listed as a business.
But the switch to digital is bringing some people choices previously unimagined. One elderly Korean woman, Smith said, was ecstatic after she got her converter box and found access to two Korean-language channels.

The least prepared U.S. market? Albuquerque-Santa Fe, N.M.,where 8.47 percent of households are rated 'completely unready.'
The most prepared? Providence, R.I.-New Bedford, Mass.,where all households are rated ready for the conversion.
Time to tune in
Is your TV ready?Some televisions sold before 2007 have digital tuners, but as of March 2007, virtually all new TVs sold in the United States had to contain a digital tuner. If you're unsure about your set, check the make and model on manufacturer Web sites or look for labels or markings indicating a digital tuner. Terms may include 'integrated digital tuner,' 'digital tuner built-in,' 'DTV,' 'ATSC' or 'HDTV.' ('Receiver' may be used instead of 'tuner.')
Not digital-ready?If your TV isn't digital-ready, most major electronics stores, including Radio Shack, Best Buy and Walmart, have converter boxes, which cost between $40 and $80.
Not ready to buy?Get a converter coupon: The government has offered up to two $40 coupons per household toward the purchase of converter boxes. Apply for coupons at www.dtv2009.gov.
