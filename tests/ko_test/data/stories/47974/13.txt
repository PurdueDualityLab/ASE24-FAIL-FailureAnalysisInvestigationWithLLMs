Jun. 15--Thousands of over-the-air TV viewers lost 6ABC, the No. 1 local news station, in Friday's digtal-TV transition. Officials are meeting in Washington today to find a solution, a government official said.
The channel also is popular with women because of its afternoon soap operas -- One Life To Live, General Hospital and All My Children.
On Friday, the nation ended the age-old analog TV signals in a switch to digital ones. An estimated 145,000 people get their TV only by free over-the-air signals. The 6ABC glitch appears to be the biggest problem with the conversion in the Philadelphia TV market.
An official with the Federal Communications Commission in Philadelphia said today the problem could be with broadcast power from the station, the government-subsidized converter boxes or antennas. The lost reception is widespread in Philadelphia, South Jersey and the suburbs.
David Dombrowski, the FCC official and an electronics engineer, said 6ABC officials and the FCC were meeting in Washington to discuss what could be done. "We probably want to get a game plan to make sure it is not the converter box," Dombrowski said.
The FCC and 6ABC could temporarily relocate the station's transmission to TV spectrum designated for public safety radios, he said. Those radios are not operable and the spectrum is unused.
Even some Philadelphia residents in Roxborough, where the TV transmission towers are located, couldn't get 6ABC, he said.
6ABC is broadcasting its digital signals on the lowest VHF band, which may be the problem.
Dombrowski answered calls on the problem yesterday at the 6ABC offices and said, "It was crazy." A "quick fix" for residents might be an outdoor antenna. But he noted that people might not have the money for an outdoor antenna, or can't install one. Many over-the-air TV viewers are elderly.
"It amazes me that they're the biggest station and they have the trouble," Kathleen Clarke, of Frankford, said today of 6ABC.
