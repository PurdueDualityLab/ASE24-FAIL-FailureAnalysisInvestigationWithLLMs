Era of analog TV at end, but digitally challenged needn't panic

The world ends tomorrow. Or at least the analog TV world. Forget another stay of execution. All East Central Illinois stations, except for WCIA, already ceased analog broadcasts.
I was heartened to see a Target ad in the Sunday News-Gazette advertising a converter the exact cost of the government coupons, meaning it would be free with a coupon. I also was pleased to see Best Buy advertising my current favorite Antennas Direct antenna that can be used indoors or out. It costs $80, the same price you would pay ordering it directly. It solved my reception problems.
Now onward with reader questions involving this momentous transition:
"I live in Champaign and have had great luck with reception for my HDTV with a digital tuner with an UHF/VHF antenna I purchased from Radio Shack. It has been mounted outside on the house, and I received all channels including all three of WILL, 12-1,12-2,12-3, until recently. I can still get everything, except those of WILL. What changed, if anything?"
First, if you were trying to view Channel 12 (now Channel 9) on May 29, they suffered a brief transmitter outage (as they did during the big storm a few weeks back). I spoke with the engineering department at WILL-DTV and was assured that the transmitter is working at full power and that its antenna is optimized for digital transmission.
Two factors that can influence off-air reception are the seasons and type of antenna. If an outdoor or attic antenna delivered good reception in March, but now the reception has deteriorated, the cause may be trees. Strange as it seems, leaves on trees can block radio waves. Also, WILL is the only DTV station in our area that remains on VHF, so you need an antenna that can receive the upper part of the VHF band. VHF signals do not necessarily reach as far as UHF.
As an adjunct to this question, I received a notice in the mail from Mediacom, the cable company that serves the outlying areas around Champaign-Urbana. The notice details Mediacom's new channel configuration for the digital era, effective June 16 to be completed by July 1. It has juggled and rearranged channel numbers as well as offering many new HD channels as part of the basic and family packages. It will carry all of WILL's digital channels: 12.1, 12.2 and 12.3. During this transition period, Mediacom seems to have dropped all of WILL. I assume that this is a technical glitch on Mediacom's part caused by the conversion and that WILL will reappear on June 16.
Remember, you must allow your TV to reprogram itself if you want to receive all the cable channels in the new lineup. Rerun the TV's initial set-up on June 17.
That brings us to this question from an Urbana resident:
"I have a second HDTV that has cable directly connected to it. So the regular and HD channels are whatever you get after the TV scans the cable signal. There are lots of channels like 63.11, 63.12, etc., that to a large extent seem to duplicate other channels but have better picture quality. Can you help me find a key to the channel numbers/broadcasters for these channels?"
Contact Comcast and ask it to send you a complete channel listing, just like Mediacom has done for its customers. When there are duplicate channels, one is the standard analog, and the other is the better quality digital. Remember that all cable companies will continue carrying analog channels for at least the next three to five years.
My in-basket is full of reader questions concerning the digital transition and other aspects of TV reception and connection. I promise to answer all of your e-mails in my next few columns. I realize that most readers feel more baffled by the brave new digital world than by the crossword puzzle above this column.
