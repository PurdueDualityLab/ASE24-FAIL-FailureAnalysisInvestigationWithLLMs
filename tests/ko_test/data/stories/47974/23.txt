Say good-bye to that snowy reception you get from your TV with the rabbit ears every time you watch 'The Tonight Show.' Like Jay Leno, it's history.
As of Friday, the way television programming has been delivered to American homes for more than 70 years is changing for all of us. Television watching will be all-digital, on virtually all stations, all the time. The old, not-so-trusty analog version is toast.
For cable and satellite TV customers, the conversion to digital may hardly register. If you're still relying on an over-the-air signal and antenna, though, and have not yet obtained a digital converter box, you've got some catching up to do. It's estimated that millions of American TV viewers without the right technology could be left in the dark Friday.
TV viewing analyst Nielsen Media Research estimates that about 35,000 metro Atlanta homes aren't ready for Friday's conversion, meaning more than 98 percent of area households are prepared. But Bernita Smith, digital television coordinator with the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights Education Fund, which is spearheading Atlanta's efforts to go fully digital, believes the number of unprepared households is much higher.
She said the elderly, low-income and those who don't speak English are among those experiencing difficulty preparing for the switch. And there have been some unforeseen glitches, she said. Residents of one group home in Atlanta, for example, have had a hard time obtaining government-provided discount coupons for digital converter boxes because they're listed as a business, and therefore not viewed as a residential facility.
On the other hand, the switch to digital is bringing some people choices they could have only imagined. Like one elderly Korean woman in Doraville, Smith said, who was ecstatic after she got her converter box and found access to two Korean-language channels.
Ready or not, there is a lot to know about our new TV landscape. Here's a basic primer:
