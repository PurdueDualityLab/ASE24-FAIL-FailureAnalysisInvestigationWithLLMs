Digital TV transition doesn't go smoothly for all viewers

Jun. 12--The long-awaited television transition from analog to digital signals did not go smoothly for all viewers today.
The second the technicians at WTSP, Channel 10, unplugged the station's analog broadcast at noon, phones started ringing off the hook.
One caller said the CBS affiliate disappeared from his Comcast cable screen.
Some Bright House Networks customers lost the signal, too, which wasn't supposed to happen -- the switchover was supposed to affect only broadcast signals.
Another caller said his digital television converter box died.
With more phones ringing, WTSP personnel descended on a makeshift phone bank set up in its morning show studios staffed by receptionists, cameramen, even the general manager.
A variety of glitches were reported. Some calls were from people with cable; others did not but had the DTV box required to receive the new signal.
"If you want to watch 'Young and the Restless,' you'll need to run a rescan, yes," one WTSP employee told a caller.
"You might need to turn your antenna north to receive us," a caller from south Hillsborough County was told.
WTSP President Ken Tonning emphasized the historic moment.
"This is a big moment," he said. "We knew some people would not be ready, no matter what. We hope they at least know something is happening."
Today was the last day for analog television signals. Anyone without cable or satellite TV service (or a very new TV) will need a digital converter box to watch free, over-the-air broadcast programs.
NBC affiliate WFLA, Channel 8, unplugged its analog broadcast about 5 a.m. Fox affiliate WTVT, Channel 13, made the switch about 1 p.m. Other stations in the area will make the switch throughout the day.
Even for those with a digital converter box, today brings some changes. It's worth having boxes perform a "rescan" on Saturday as some stations are boosting their transmitting power or altering the location of their channel.
Anyone with questions about the changeover or the DTV box coupon program can call the Federal Communications Commission at 1-888-528-2009 or go to www.dtv2009.gov.
