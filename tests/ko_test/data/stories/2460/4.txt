GALILEO GOES TO `SAFE MODE' AS ENGINEERS IRON OUT GLITCH

Trouble aboard the Galileo spacecraft, now orbiting Jupiter, has caused it to turn itself off and phone home for help.
Galileo's computers put the probe on "safe mode" Saturday after encountering a glitch, according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.
"Basically, it phones home," said Torrence V. Johnson, who is project scientist for Galileo's two-year, unmanned mission to Jupiter and its moons.
"Usually, these things turn out to be false alarms," Johnson said.
The spacecraft Galileo, named after the astronomer who discovered the four great moons of Jupiter in 1610, has gone into safe mode 10 other times since its launch in 1989.
Scientists expect Galileo to be turned on again by Sept. 1, in time for its second pass by the Jovian moon Ganymede on Sept. 6.
Johnson said the shutdown was not altogether unexpected because of a previous software fix that was "at least as tricky as taking a dozen computers and loading Windows 95 on them - and then expecting them to work together."
At the time that Galileo went into safe mode, it was transmitting the last of images that had been sent previously but in a different form. Johnson said the images would be re-sent.
Already, Galileo has probed Jupiter's Red Spot and discovered evidence of water on one of its moons, Europa.
