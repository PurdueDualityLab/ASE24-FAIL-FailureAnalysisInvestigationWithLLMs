MOSCOW Yeltsin begins vacation
President Boris Yeltsin's aides abruptly announced Monday that the ailing Russian leader was on vacation - again - renewing speculation about his health. Yeltsin is staying at his Rus country residence, about 56 miles northeast of Moscow, spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said. He refused to say how long the president, who has been in seclusion for most of the summer, would remain on vacation.
Yastrzhembsky told The Associated Press that Yeltsin might not stay there for the entire duration of his vacation, saying his time off "has just started." Earlier this month, Yeltsin spent two days in the northern region of Valdai on what was described as a pre-vacation trip.
Yeltsin "is working on documents and maintains control over the issues of domestic and foreign politics," Yastrzhembsky said in a statement.
Earlier, there were reports that Yeltsin might meet Tuesday with security chief Alexander Lebed to discuss a peace settlement for the breakaway republic of Chechnya; the sudden announcement made such a meeting unlikely.
Yeltsin may hold meetings during his vacation, but Yastrzhembsky told Russian news agencies the president "must be given a chance to rest and restore his health after the election campaign."
Aides have said that the 65-year-old Yeltsin, who has a history of heart trouble, was exhausted by the furious presidential race and needed a "proper" rest.
Yeltsin vanished into a health resort near the end of his re-election campaign in June, resurfacing briefly to take his oath on Aug. 9 and give a television interview last Thursday.
A weary shadow of the energetic leader who plunged into the campaign, he moved stiffly and slurred his speech at times. The Kremlin has provided no concrete information about the state of Yeltsin's health.
Working from the resort and occasionally from the Kremlin, the president has managed to push through parliament the re-appointment of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, and has named the entire Cabinet.
He also has issued a number of important economic decrees - but did little to address the new outburst of violence in Chechnya, where Russian soldiers have been fighting separatist rebels for the past 20 months. DUBAI, United Arab Emirates Woman pardoned from beheading
As the executioner cleaned his sword for her beheading, a condemned Saudi woman won a pardon from the father of a man she had slain, according to a dramatic Saudi account that offered a rare glimpse of crime and punishment in the Islamic nation.
Tears and pleading are the only appeals criminals can make in Saudi Arabia, where only the families of their victims can grant pardons. In the woman's case, clemency came just moments before she was to die, the Al-Eqtisadiah newspaper said.
The newspaper reported the near-beheading in detail Monday from a public square in the holy city of Mecca.
Saudi executions are usually conducted in public, although few foreigners have witnessed one. Usually they are reported briefly in newspapers. Monday's account, unusual in its detail, described not only the process of execution, but the power a victim's family can have over the fate of a criminal.
The newspaper gave this account: Najah Al-Kariss was locked in a police truck Sunday when she heard the roar of the crowd. She knew that meant the first execution of the day - of a Pakistani man convicted of armed robbery - had been carried out.
Hers would be next. She would be led out of the truck in the head-to-toe veil that all women in Saudi Arabia wear in public, and beheaded with a sword for killing a man who had tried to "harm" her. The newspaper did not say how.
As the executioner wiped the crescent-shaped blade of his sword, Al-Kariss asked to see Dakheel Al-Luhaybi, the father of the man she killed.
A guard opened the truck door, and Al-Kariss stepped into the 109-degree sun. In a tearful appeal, she begged Al-Luhaybi to spare her.
Al-Luhaybi, 66, had already heard appeals from the woman's friends and family, and had even been offered $1 million to grant the pardon, he said.
His wife and children, however, were opposed to it, and he had resolved to watch Al-Kariss die.
But after hearing the woman's pleas - and after the intercession of police officers and others in the crowd - he consulted family members again and decided to forgive Al-Kariss in order to "gain God's blessings."
Al-Kariss wept with gratitude, and as word circulated through the square, the crowd began chanting "Allahu akbar," Arabic for "God is great." Some spectators cheered and ululated, while others fought back tears, the report said.
It said Al-Kariss would be freed as soon as the family signs papers acknowledging the pardon.
It did not indicate whether Al-Luhaybi would take the $1 million.
In the Saudi interpretation of Sharia, the Islamic code of justice, a victim's family has control over the fate of a criminal.
LOS ANGELES Computer problem hits Jupiter mission
Another computer glitch aboard the troubled Galileo spacecraft was puzzling engineers Monday, 10 days before the probe was scheduled to pass by one of Jupiter's moons.
"We've got a ways to go to figure out what happened here," said William O'Neil, project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.
Galileo is supposed to be transmitting information about the moon Ganymede. The spacecraft took black-and-white photographs of Ganymede June 26 during the first of four flybys of the planet and its four major moons.
But a computer problem Saturday knocked Galileo into "safe mode," where only essential functions are up and running. It was the 11th "safe mode" for the spacecraft since it was launched in 1989.
Engineers believe the problem was caused by a mistake in a sequence a computer was ordered to perform, O'Neil said. Galileo should be ready to gather more information during a Sept. 6 flyby of Ganymede, but transmitting the data home may have to wait for a fix.
Galileo was launched in 1989 and reached Jupiter last December, beginning a two-year exploration of the solar system's largest planet and its moons.
Earlier problems affected Galileo's tape recorder and main antenna, which reduced the craft's capacity for capturing and sending home pictures.
AURORA,Ohio Charges filed in Sea World accident
AURORA, Ohio (AP) - The driver and the owners of a stunt boat that slammed into a grandstand at Sea World of Ohio, injuring 23 people, face charges related to the boat's operation, officials said Monday.
Andrew R. Schleis was driving the boat Aug. 17 when the steering mechanism broke and the 1,500-pound boat slid five rows into the bleachers. Investigators said the boat was missing a part of its steering controls.
Schleis, 25, of Kent, was charged with failing to operate at a safe speed for the conditions and failing to turn off the motor when the steering failed. Each charge is punishable by 30 days in jail and a $250 fine.
He did not return a message left at his home Monday.
The owner of the boat, World Entertainment Services Inc. of Winter Park, Fla., was charged with three marine regulation violations unrelated to the accident but discovered during the investigation.
Investigators said the company failed to observe requirements for life preservers, on-board distress signals and anchors. Each is punishable by a $100 fine.
Tom Weber, general manager of World Entertainment Services, said the company was unaware of the regulations but would comply.
SPRINGFIELD, Mo. Firing violated religious freedom
A school violated the religious freedom of a second-grade teacher when it fired her after she gave her pupils "magic rocks" to boost their morale, a jury ruled Monday.
A U.S. District Court jury ordered the Strafford public school system to pay Leslie Cowan the $18,000 salary she lost when the school board refused to rehire her for the 1993-94 school year.
School lawyers insist she was let go because of poor performance, but Cowan said it was the rocks.
"I never thought that it would offend anybody," Cowan said. "I just did it for the self-esteem of the kids. It wasn't a question I ever asked myself."
At the end of the school year in 1992, Cowan sent 20 second-grade students home with a smooth glass rock and a note, stating:
"The magic rock you have, will always let you know that you can do anything that you set your mind to. To make your rock work, close you (sic) eyes, rub it and say to yourself three times, `I am a special and terrific person, with talents of my own!' Before you put your rock away, think of three good things about yourself. After you have put your rock away, you will know that the magic has worked." The rock was meant to be a morale-booster and had nothing to do with religion, Cowan said.
When her contract was not renewed in the fall of the following year, she blamed it on parents and a local preacher who complained.
"There was a fear in the community of New Agism and occultism," her lawyer, Lisa Van Amburg, said. "She had no idea when she sent home this letter that she would offend anybody or that anybody would think she was a witch."
Cowan's lawyers showed jurors a note written by Principal Lucille Cogdill in which she stated her belief that parents had removed their children from the school because of the rock.
School lawyer Tom Mickus said the rock was irrelevant.
