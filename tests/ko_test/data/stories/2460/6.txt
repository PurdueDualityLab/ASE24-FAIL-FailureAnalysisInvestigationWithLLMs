Galileo Team Wrestles To Keep Second Flyby

The Galileo orbiter went into a ``safe'' mode on Aug. 24 because of a computer error, and engineers were hoping to have full operation restored by Sept. 1, when the science sequence for the second Ganymede flyby is set to start.
Controllers began sending commands on Aug. 28, and the spacecraft and its computer were operating normally again on Aug. 29. However, the majority of scientific instruments still needed to be turned on or reconfigured, and this was to be done on Aug. 31.
The orbiter was able to perform a small but critical orbit trim maneuver (OTM) while it was in the safe mode, with only one of its two command and data subsystem computers (CDS-A and CDS-B) operating. This was the first time an OTM had been performed while in the safe mode, and the procedure had been practiced on a ground simulator several months earlier.
OTM-9 was conducted on Aug. 27 so that the Ganymede moon flyby on Sept. 6 gives the proper gravity assist. Though OTM-9 changed velocity by under 0.1 meter/sec., the uncorrected error would have been amplified by the flyby to where there would not have been enough propellant to complete the mission, William J. O'Neil, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory project manager, said. ``I was very relieved that it got done,'' he said.
The error occurred in a CDS-A processor located on the despun side of the spacecraft, and initially looked like a slip ring shorting problem that was last seen in September, 1993. But readout of the memory showed that some of the new data compression software had taken too long to execute, which shut all of CDS-A down. The new software has been in operation for three months, O'Neil said. Galileo then automatically entered the safe mode, which put CDS-B in charge and suspended all but basic engineering activities. Spacecraft spin and attitude remained constant.
The cause of the error was not clear late last week and also could have been a single-event upset or other glitch not related to the new software, O'Neil said. ``We still don't know if it won't go down again,'' he said last week. An alternate science sequence is being prepared that would start three days later if there are revival difficulties.
``There's still a chance there's some `gotcha' in there, but it's less likely after three months of operation. We'll be a little more apprehensive in the future.'' Galileo was resending an image from the first Ganymede flyby at a higher resolution when the problem occurred (AW&ST Aug. 19, p. 28). There are several pieces of data on the spacecraft tape recorder that have not been sent yet, and they will be overwritten by the second flyby. ``Normally, we don't expect to be able to play back all the data that's been recorded,'' O'Neil said. The new data compression software had been working more efficiently than expected and the playback was ahead of schedule, he said.
