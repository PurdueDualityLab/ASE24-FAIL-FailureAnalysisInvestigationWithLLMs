AIDS researcher charged with stealing $570,000
MIAMI -- An AIDSresearcher accused of keeping more than $570,000 in federal grant money for his own use surrendered to authorities Monday, vowing to continue his work. Dr. Lionel Resnick was charged Aug. 21 with 49 federal counts of mail fraud and three counts of money laundering. He was released on $100,000 bail. Resnick, the former chief of research at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach, is accused of using the hospital's laboratory, staff and equipment to do virus tests for other facilities while billing his own company, Vironc Inc., for work done from 1989 to 1994.
Residue may be traced to soldiers
SMITHTOWN, N.Y. --Investigators said Monday they are looking into whether microscopic traces of explosive residue might have come aboard Trans World Airlines Flight 800 when the Boeing 747 was being used as a troop carrier in the Persian Gulf war. The TWA plane, which exploded July 17, killing 230 people, was among several planes pressed into service to move troops during the gulf war. According to sources close to the investigation, its last use for a troop movement was in 1991. Explosives are not supposed to be brought into the passenger cabin, but investigators will want to know whether the traces found so far could have been brought aboard on the boots or uniforms of soldiers who had used explosives.

Galileo glitch puzzles engineers
LOS ANGELES -- Another computer glitchaboard the troubled Galileo spacecraft was puzzling engineers Monday, 10 days before the probe was scheduled to pass by one of Jupiter's moons. Galileo is supposed to be transmitting information about the moon Ganymede, but a computer problem Saturday knocked Galileo into ``safe mode,'' where only essential functions are up and running. It was the 11th ``safe mode'' for the spacecraft since it was launched in 1989.
