Galileo Team Deals With Mode Glitch
LOS ANGELES -- Just months into the exploration of Jupiter and its moons, a computer error put the Galileo spacecraft into a 'safe mode' and engineers were hustling to solve the problem.
Mission officials on Monday said the spacecraft was otherwise OK and they believed the problem can be sorted out -- with some effort.
'We've got a ways to go to figure out what happened here,' said William O'Neil, Galileo project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.
Church Fire Likely Arson, Prober Says
BENTON, Ark. -- A fire that burned a church with a predominately white congregation was apparently arson, investigators said.
Accidental factors were ruled out in Saturday night's fire at the Kentucky Missionary Baptist Church, said Bill Buford, agent in charge of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms office at Little Rock.
A final ruling on the cause will come after tests are complete, which could take at least two weeks, Buford said Monday.
The fire does not appear to be related to arson fires last week at two other churches in eastern Arkansas, Buford said.
Wilson To Sign 'Castration' Bill
SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Child molesters could be given drugs to stifle their sex drives and repeat offenders would automatically face 'chemical castration' under a bill Gov. Pete Wilson has vowed to sign into law.
Legislation passed by the state Senate last week would allow courts to make first-time child molesters take hormone-suppressing drugs when paroled from prison.
The drug treatment would be mandatory for a second offense. The bill does not actually require emasculation, though a molester could choose physical castration instead of the drug treatment intended to lower testosterone levels.
