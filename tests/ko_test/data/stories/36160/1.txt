Japan's Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) delayed launch of an imaging satellite because of a glitch in data transmission between the H-2A rocket and ground control. JAXA officials said a new date for the mission, originally scheduled for a Jan. 19 launch from Japan's Tanegashima Space Center, hasn't been set. The H-2A payload is a Japanese Advanced Land Observation Satellite. The craft was built by major Japanese aerospace firms Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries.
