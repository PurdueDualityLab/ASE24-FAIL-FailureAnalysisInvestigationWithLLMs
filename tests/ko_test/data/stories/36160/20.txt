(EDS: ADDING DETAILS, POSSIBLE NEW LAUNCH DATE)
The Japan AerospaceExploration Agency (JAXA) said Wednesday it has postponed the launch of a land-observation satellite, originally scheduled for Thursday, due to a technical glitch in the launch vehicle.
The No. 8 version of theH-2A rocket carrying the Advanced Land Observing Satellite was set to be launched from the Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture on Thursday morning.
One of the devices fortransmitting data on flight and rocket conditions to the ground was found to be malfunctioning, the agency said.
The new launch date isexpected to be Saturday at the earliest, the agency said. Replacement work would require one day while the weather is forecast to deteriorate Friday, it added.
The transmitters will be used for the first time. The malfunction did not reoccur after rebooting but since the cause of the glitch was unknown, the agency decided to replace a transmitter.
The satellite, dubbedDaichi, is intended to orbit about 690 kilometers above the earth and capture images of disaster-hit regions.
