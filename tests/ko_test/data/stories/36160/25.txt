The launch of Japan's H2A rocket has been put off due to a problem on a part, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) announced Wednesday.
The rocket was originally scheduled to blast off at 10:33 a.m. (0133 GMT) Thursday at the Tanegashima Space Center in southern Kagoshima prefecture.
Technicians, however, found Tuesday that an electronic device was in trouble. The gadget serves to transmit the rocket's flight data back to controllers.
The new launch will not be realized at least by Saturday due to necessary work of replacing the faulted part and bad weather conditions, according to JAXA.
With the rocket, Japan intends to put in orbit its Advanced Land Observing Satellite, which can provide high-resolution and three-dimensional terrestrial images with newly developed sensors.
