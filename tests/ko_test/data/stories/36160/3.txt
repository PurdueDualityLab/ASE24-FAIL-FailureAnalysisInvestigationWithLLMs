We will take effective defense measures if attacked," he said.

Strong earthquake rocks eastern IndonesiaJAKARTA - The Associated Press
A powerful earthquakejolted a 2,000-kilometer (1,240-mile) swath of Indonesia early on Saturday, sending hundreds of panicked residents fleeing to higher ground, but fears of a tsunami did not materialize. There were no immediate reports of injuries or serious damage from the magnitude-7.7 quake. The earthquake struck beneath the Banda Sea in the Maluku Islands at 1:58 a.m. Saturday (1658 GMT Friday), but its depth of 342 kilometers (212 miles) helped minimize the impact, Indonesian meteorological officials said. Still, fears of a tsunami -- like the 2004 waves that killed more than 130,000 people on the western side of the sprawling archipelago -- sparked panic among residents and sent them fleeing from their homes, witnesses said.Hundreds of thousands attend Islamic gathering TONGI, Bangladesh - The AP
