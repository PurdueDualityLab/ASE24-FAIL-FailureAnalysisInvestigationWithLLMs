TOKYO (AP)--A computer glitchthat partially shut down a Japanese satellite has been repaired and the craft has returned to normal operation, Japan's space agency said Saturday.
The four-ton AdvancedLand Observation Satellite had reported an error late Friday night in the system that processes the observation data it collects, said spokesman Tatsuo Oshima of the Japan Space and Exploration Agency.
The agency was able to clear the error Saturday, he said.
Information about what caused the glitch could not yet be made available, he said.
The agency was confident the glitch had not caused any permanent problems for the satellite's data-processing system, he said.
After clearing the glitch,the space agency began a three-month-long instrument initialization procedure originally set to start Saturday morning, Oshima said. The effect of the late start was seen as minor.
"The delay has had no impact on our schedule," Oshima said.
The satellite - whichbegins its observation mission in April - has three earth sensors that can obtain terrain data for maps and make weather observations of the Asia-Pacific region.
Its successful liftoffTuesday came after repeated delays caused by bad weather and problems with sensing equipment. [ 28-01-06 1056GMT ]
