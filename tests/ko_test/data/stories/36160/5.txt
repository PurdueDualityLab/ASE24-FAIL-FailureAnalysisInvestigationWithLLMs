TOKYO (AP)--A computer glitchis disrupting communications with a Japanese observation satellite, the latest in a string of problems since the ship's launch last week, the space agency said Monday.
Some of the data receivedon Monday from the four-ton Advanced Land Observation Satellite, now orbiting the Earth about 700 kilometers away, was defective or missing, the Japan Space and Exploration Agency said in a statement.
The missing data don'taffect JAXA's ability to control the satellite, according to spokesman Tatsuo Oshima. The agency was investigating the glitch, Oshima said.
The satellite, which hasthree earth sensors that can obtain terrain data for maps and make weather observations of the Asia-Pacific region, was partially shut down last week following a glitch in its data processing system, but recovered on Saturday.
Its successful liftoff this past Tuesday came after repeated delays due to bad weather and problems with sensing equipment.
Japan, which put its first satellite in orbit in 1972, has recently experienced a number of problems in its space program.
Last month, the spaceagency announced it would delay until 2010 the return of a probe sent to collect samples from an asteroid because a thruster problem put the vehicle into an unexpected spin.
The probe was originally scheduled to return to Earth in June 2007. [ 30-01-06 1328GMT ]
