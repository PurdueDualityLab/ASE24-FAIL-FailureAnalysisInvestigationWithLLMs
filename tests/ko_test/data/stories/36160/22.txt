Computer glitch hits new satellite

A computer glitch partially shut down a Japanese satellite that launched earlier this week, a space agency spokesman said today.
In the latest problem with Japan's star-crossed space programme, the four-tonne Advanced Land Observation Satellite reported an error yesterday in the system that processes the observation data it collected, Japan Space and Exploration Agency spokesman Tatsuo Oshima said.
The satellite was switched into "safe mode" - a hold state - while agency officials reviewed the error-detection data, Oshima said.
"We don't think the problem will turn out to be something that cannot be repaired," he said, adding that the agency at present did not believe the glitch would have a long-term effect on the satellite's mission.
The satellite has three earth sensors that can obtain terrain data for maps and make weather observations of the Asia-Pacific region.
Its successful lift-off on Tuesday came after repeated delays due to bad weather and problems with sensing equipment.
Japan - which put its first satellite in orbit in 1972 - has experienced a number of problems in its space programme of late.
Most recently, the space agency announced last month it would delay until 2010 the return of a problem-plagued probe sent to collect samples from an asteroid because a thruster problem put the vehicle into an unexpected spin.
The Hayabusa probe was originally scheduled to return to Earth in June 2007.
