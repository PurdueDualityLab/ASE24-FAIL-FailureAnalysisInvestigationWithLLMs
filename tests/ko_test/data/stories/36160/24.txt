(EDS: UPDATING WITH SPACE AGENCY SAYING IT FINDS NO PROBLEM)
Some trouble had beendetected in a land-observation satellite Friday after it was deployed from a domestically made H-2A rocket earlier this week, Japan's space agency said Saturday, later identifying it as caused by a computer glitch that posed no problem to the satellite's operation.
The trouble was detectedin the data processing system of the Advanced Land Observing Satellite, nicknamed ''Daichi,'' at 10:51 p.m. Friday during an operation check upon completion of the process to change its position control, according to the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency.
The computer controllingthe whole satellite system detected the trouble due to a temporary malfunctioning of the computer after it was exposed to radiation in the space, it said.
Proper function wasrestored after resetting the computer and there will be no resulting problem in operation caused hereafter, it said.
With the check ended, the satellite is now able to precisely control its position, it said.
The satellite Daichi willorbit about 690 kilometers above the Earth and is intended to collect topographic data to contribute to cartography and capture images of disaster-hit areas anywhere in the world, among other things, the agency said earlier.
