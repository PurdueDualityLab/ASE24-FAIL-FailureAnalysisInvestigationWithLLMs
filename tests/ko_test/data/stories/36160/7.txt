TANEGASHIMA, Japan (AP) -Japan's space agency said Thursday it is postponing the launch of an observation satellite due to poor weather. The original date of a Thursday launch has been moved back to Saturday at the earliest.
The rocket launch hadearlier been delayed because of a technical failure in data transmission equipment on the launch vehicle.
The H-2A rocket was to carry a four-ton Advanced Land Observing Satellite.
Officials at Japan'sspace agency, known as JAXA, had to put off the launch at first because one of three telemetry transmitters intended to send flight data to the ground malfunctioned during final tests.
That problem has beensolved, but a thunderstorm has hit this remote island, about 1,200 kilometers (700 miles) south of Tokyo, forcing the further delay. A new launch date has not been determined, but will not be before Saturday, JAXA said in a statement.
The satellite is carryingthree earth sensors that can obtain terrain data for maps and make all-weather observations of the Asia-Pacific region.
The H-2A rocket, thebackbone of the Japanese space program, was last launched successfully in February 2005. In November 2003, an H-2A rocket carrying two spy satellites malfunctioned and was destroyed in mid-flight.
The launch is to be theeighth for an H-2A, a two-stage launch vehicle. The rocket had five successful flights in a row after its first in August 2001.
