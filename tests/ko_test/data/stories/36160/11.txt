TOKYO (AP)--A computer glitch partially shut down a Japanese satellite that launched this week, a space agency spokesman said Saturday.
In the latest problemwith Japan's star-crossed space program, the four-ton Advanced Land Observation Satellite reported an error Friday night in the system that processes the observation data it collects, Japan Space and Exploration Agency spokesman Tatsuo Oshima said.
The satellite wasswitched into "safe mode" - a hold state - while agency officials review the error-detection data, Oshima said.
"We don't think theproblem will turn out to be something that cannot be repaired," he said, adding that the agency at present does not believe the glitch will have a long-term effect on the satellite's mission.
The satellite has threeearth sensors that can obtain terrain data for maps and make weather observations of the Asia-Pacific region.
Its successful liftoff this past Tuesday came after repeated delays due to bad weather and problems with sensing equipment.
Japan - which put its first satellite in orbit in 1972 - has experienced problems in its space program.
Most recently, the spaceagency announced last month it would delay until 2010 the return of a problem-plagued probe sent to collect samples from an asteroid because a thruster problem put the vehicle into an unexpected spin.
The Hayabusa probe was originally scheduled to return to Earth in June 2007. [ 28-01-06 0629GMT ]
