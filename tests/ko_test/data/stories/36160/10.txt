TOKYO (AP) - A computer glitchthat partially shut down a Japanese satellite launched this past week has been repaired and the craft has returned to normal, the space agency said Saturday.
In the latest problemwith Japan's star-crossed space program, the four-ton Advanced Land Observation Satellite reported an error late Friday night in the system that processes the observation data it collects, Japan Space and Exploration Agency spokesman Tatsuo Oshima said.
The agency was able toclear the error on Saturday and returned the satellite to normal operating condition that afternoon, Oshima said.
Information about what caused the glitch could not yet be made available, he said.
The agency was confident the glitch had not caused any permanent problems for the satellite's data-processing system, he said.
After clearing the glitch,the space agency began a three-month-long instrument initialization procedure originally set to start Saturday morning, Oshima said. The effect of the late start was seen as minor.
"The delay has had no impact on our schedule," Oshima said.
The satellite --whichbegins its observation mission in April -- has three earth sensors that can obtain terrain data for maps and make weather observations of the Asia-Pacific region.
Its successful liftoff this past Tuesday came after repeated delays due to bad weather and problems with sensing equipment.
Japan -- which put its first satellite in orbit in 1972 -- has experienced a number of problems in its space program.
Most recently, the spaceagency announced last month it would delay until 2010 the return of a problem-plagued probe sent to collect samples from an asteroid because a thruster problem put the vehicle into an unexpected spin.
The Hayabusa probe was originally scheduled to return to Earth in June 2007.
