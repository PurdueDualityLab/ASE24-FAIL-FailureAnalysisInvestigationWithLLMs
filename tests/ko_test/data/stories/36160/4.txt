Citizens Against Govt.Waste (CAGW) criticized an Air Force plan to grant a multimillion dollar annual subsidy for heavy satellite launches to the United Launch Alliance -- Boeing and Lockheed Martin's joint venture. CAGW officials said the DoD has conditionally approved the subsidy plan; final approval rests with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC has shown more skepticism than the DoD on the United Launch Alliance deal. In Oct., the FTC questioned Boeing and Lockheed Martin's claim that allowing them to team on the $32 billion Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program will save the govt. $100-$150 million a year, and told the companies it needed time to review the proposal (SW Oct 31 p1). "The Air Force policy is tantamount to a government bailout," argued CAGW Pres. Tom Schatz: "It is a multimillion dollar subsidy to an entity that is effectively insulated from competition." The EELV program started in 1995 to assure federal govt.
access to space bykeeping the 2 domestic heavy launch players viable. The first round of contracts was awarded to Boeing and Lockheed Martin in 1998 with the expectation that a strong commercial launch market would emerge to fill in govt. launch gaps. But that hasn't happened, the CAGW said, and so the govt. has assumed an increasing share of the risk and cost of the launching operations. According to Govt. Accountability Office reports, the EELV's unit cost has grown 81% since its start. If the Air Force plan to subsidize the United Launch Alliance is approved, the group will benefit from $650 million in govt. subsidies for infrastructure and $100 million a launch, CAGW officials said. "The contracts' structure obscures the true cost to taxpayers... The Air Force should revert to price- competitive acquisitions and widen the playing field to new competitors," Schatz argued. Boeing and Lockheed Martin are jointly negotiating for the 3rd round of EELV launches for the Air Force, NASA and the National Security Agency, which will cover 23 missions lasting through 2011 and beyond. The firms continue to compete for private launches.

Japan's Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) delayed launch of an imaging satellite because of a glitchin data transmission between the H-2A rocket and ground control. JAXA officials said a new date for the mission, originally scheduled for a Jan. 19 launch from Japan's Tanegashima Space Center, hasn't been set. The H-2A payload is a Japanese Advanced Land Observation Satellite. The craft was built by major Japanese aerospace firms Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries.

Telesat said it tappedInternational Launch Services (ILS) to launch Nimiq 4 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in 2008 aboard a Proton Breeze M vehicle. ILS's Proton Breeze M lofted Telesat's Anik F1R in Sept. 2005 and will launch the Anik F2 this year, ILS officials said. Nimiq 4, built by EADS Astrium for satellite TV distribution in Canada, is Telesat's 18th satellite.

China Satcom signed lastweek with China's launch provider to send up a French-made broadcast satellite, Chinese news reports said. The Chinese launch contractor will tap the China Great Wall Industry to launch an Alcatel Alenia Space satellite in 2007, reports said. The satellite, ChinaSat 6B, will see use for TV and radio in the region.
