TOKYO, Jan. 18 (Xinhua)-- The launch of Japan's H2A rocket has been put off due to a problem on a part, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) announced Wednesday.
The rocket was originallyscheduled to blast off at 10:33 a.m. (0133 GMT) Thursday at the Tanegashima Space Center in southern Kagoshima prefecture.
Technicians, however,found Tuesday that an electronic device was in trouble. The gadget serves to transmit the rocket's flight data back to controllers.
