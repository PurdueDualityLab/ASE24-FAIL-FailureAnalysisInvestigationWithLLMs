The launch of an H-2A rocket carrying a land-observation satellite that was postponed due to a technical glitch will be carried out Sunday or later, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency said Thursday.
The No. 8 version of theH-2A rocket carrying the Advanced Land Observing Satellite was originally scheduled to be launched Jan. 12 from the Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture.
But the aerospace agencypostponed the launch as it found malfunctions in one of the devices for transmitting data on flight and rocket conditions to the ground.
The agency has fixed theproblem but the launch cannot happen until at least Sunday in view of continuous rain and strong winds in the region.
