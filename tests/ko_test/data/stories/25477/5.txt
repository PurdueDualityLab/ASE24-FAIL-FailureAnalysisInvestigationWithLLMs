Kellogg Co has revealed that thousands of people who entered American Airlines' online sweepstakes have been wrongly informed of winning a grand prize.
Due to a computer glitch, several thousand people were informed erroneously by e-mail that they had won a grand prize of 25,000 of the airline's frequent-flyer miles. The glitch has now been corrected and the contest - which runs from 7 April to 5 June - will continue.
As a goodwill gesture, Kellogg will issue credits for 500 AAdvantage miles to each household that received the erroneous message.
