The chief executive of Eli Lilly and Co. said Monday the drug maker is reviewing whether the company might have a drug that could combat SARS.
Sidney Taurel told reporters that one recently approved Lilly drug potentially could help those with severe acute respiratory syndrome. The drug Xigris was approved in late 2001 to fight fatal blood infections, or sepsis.
Taurel said some SARS patients exhibit symptoms of sepsis in the latter stage of the illness and that Xigris possibly could reverse the infection.
However, he said it is too early to say whether Xigris would help and that the Indianapolisbased company's scientists were studying the issue.
Taurel spoke to reporters before Lilly's annual shareholders meeting in Indianapolis on Monday.

The reopening of the operation is expected to result in at least 10 production jobs and four management positions.

Computer glitch leads to too many winners
Kellogg Co. said a computer glitch involving its American Airlines online sweepstakes resulted in some people being informed erroneously by e-mail that they had won a grand prize of 25,000 of the airline's frequent-flier miles.
American spokeswoman Laura Mayo said Monday that several thousand of the airline's customers who take part in the AAdvantage loyalty program received the computer notification during the weekend.
The Kellogg's-American Airlines 25,000 Miles-a-Day Sweepstakes started April 7 and continues through June 5. Only 60 grand prizes - one per day - were supposed to be awarded.
