BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) - Kellogg Co. said a computer glitch involving its American Airlines online sweepstakes resulted in several thousand people being informed erroneously by e-mail that they had won a grand prize of 25,000 of the airline's frequent-flier miles.
American spokeswoman Laura Mayo said Monday that all were customers who take part in the AAdvantage loyalty program. They received the erroneous notification sometime over the weekend, she said.
The Kellogg's-American Airlines 25,000 Miles-a-Day Sweepstakes started April 7 and continues through June 5. Only 60 grand prizes - one per day - were supposed to be awarded. Each grand prize has a retail value of $700.
Kellogg spokeswoman Christine Ervin said the glitch was corrected and the contest is continuing, she said.
As a goodwill gesture, Kellogg will issue credits for 500 AAdvantage miles to each household that received the erroneous message, she said.
