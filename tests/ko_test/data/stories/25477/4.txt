(FinancialWire) Surprise from Kellogg! You just won a free round-trip on American Airlines! April Fool! American Airlines is the embattled unit of AMR Corp. (NYSE: AMR). Kellogg (NYSE: K) is involved in an online promotion with the airline that somehow went awry. A computer glitch apparently resulted in several thousand of the company's Aadvantage loyalty program customers receiving an email notification that they each had won a grand prize of 25,000 frequenty-flyer miles, enough for a round-trip coach fare anywhere in the U.S. Actually only 60 of the grand prizes were supposed to be awarded in the Kellogg' s-American Airlines 25,000 Miles-a-Day Sweepstakes running from April 7 to June 5. Kellogg said it will issue credits of 500 Aadvantage miles to each recipient of the erroneous message. That should be enough mileage for a trip to the corner grocery store to buy some Post Raisin Bran.
