Exchange Service Works to Correct Inadvertent Charges
From an Army and Air Force Exchange Service News Release
DALLAS, Aug. 16, 2010 - Numerous transactions at Army and Air Force Exchange operations are experiencing a double whammy no one saw coming: a processing error resulting in duplicate charges on credit and debit card transactions.
"Shoppers who swiped their cards any time between Aug. 7 and Aug. 9 at an AAFES facility are strongly encouraged to review their statements to see if they are impacted by this issue," said Army Col. Virgil William, AAFES chief of staff. "If a customer finds a billing anomaly, no action will be required on their part, as we're working to correct inaccuracies on their behalf."
Scores of associates from AAFES' information technology and finance and accounting teams are working around the clock to remedy all erroneous charges created as a result of the processing error.
"We're putting all the resources we have towards doing the right thing for customers affected by this unfortunate turn of events," Williams said. "If there is an overdraft fee as result of a duplicate charge, we're going to fix it. Our priority is to take corrective action as quickly as possible and return customers' accounts to the exact state they were prior to this glitch."
The processing error that produced duplicate charges affected AAFES locations worldwide. Depending on the type of card used, officials said, corrective action could be visible to the customer anywhere from 24 hours to a couple of weeks.
"The timeline is subject to a number of variables," Williams said. "Regardless, we want exchange shoppers to know that every possible measure is being taken to eliminate any additional charges and rectify any concerns created as a result of this processing miscue."
