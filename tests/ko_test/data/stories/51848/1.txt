While the Army and Air Force Exchange Service continues to work around the clock to remedy erroneous credit and debit card charges created as a result of a processing error, shoppers who incurred overdraft fees are being reimbursed at their local facility.
'We promised to do the right thing for our customers that were affected by this unfortunate glitch and we are honoring that promise,' said AAFES' Senior Enlisted Advisor Chief Jeffry Helm. 'We regret any inconvenience this may have caused and want to reimburse them as quickly as possible.'
Shoppers whose credit cards were double charged and, as a result, suffered overdraft fees, can simply bring documentation, such as an overdraft notice or online statement, to their nearest exchange for a full refund of the fees.
The processing error that produced duplicate charges affected AAFES locations worldwide. Depending on the type of card used, corrective action could be visible to the customer anywhere from 24 hours to a couple of weeks.
