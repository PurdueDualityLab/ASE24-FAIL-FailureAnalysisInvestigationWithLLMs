Computer glitches at banks today were causing customers problems but they did not appear to be related or systemic.
Bank of New Zealand (BNZ) spokeswoman Sarah Hensley said the bank had experienced some problems overnight, and its own staff had not been paid.
However, the problems were minor 'in the scheme of things' and were expected to be fixed by lunchtime today, Ms Hensley said.
The problems had affected BNZ's business banking section and did not seem to have interfered with automatic teller machines or Eftpos systems, she said.
It was not known what had caused the glitches.
ANZ Bank spokeswoman said that the bank had experienced some minor problems due to the heavy volume of transactions it had had to process following the five-day Easter holiday.
ANZ customers were unable to get their transactions records today but could carry out transactions normally. Separately, ANZ's telephone banking operation had crashed due to unrelated glitches.
The spokeswoman expected the phone banking system to be fixed later this morning and customers should be able to get their transaction records tomorrow.
A Reserve Bank spokesman said the central bank was unaware of any problems.
Similarly, a spokeswoman for EDS, which took over the old cheque and bank transaction company, Databank, said her company was not aware of any problems.
WestpacTrust also reported problems overnight, due to the large number of transactions to be processed after the long weekend, bank spokesman Peter Thornbury said.
The backlog meant information transferred between banks took two or three hours longer than usual to arrive, but the processing delays had now been cleared up, Mr Thornbury said. -- NZPA
