WASHINGTON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission gave interim approval Wednesday for three California electric utitlies to start up the state's first independent system operator (ISO), which is supposed to help bring competitive electricity rates to California consumers.
The ISO, which will be formed by Pacific Gas and Electric Co, San Diego Gas and Electric Co, and Southern California Edison Co, is designed to ensure that electricty provided by different power companies is transmitted fairly.
The FERC said the ISO can begin operating Nov. 1. However, additional regulatory hurdles must be cleared by the three utilities before the agency gives its final approval for the ISO.
"When the inevitable glitch becomes apparent we will have to make a change," FERC commissioner Vicky Bailey said. "For now, we're saying let's let this market go," she said, referring to the deregulation of California's electricity market.
In its iterim approval, the FERC again rejected a request from the three utilities that the governing board of the ISO be made up of only California residents. The FERC's decision reflects the likelihood that the ISO will be doing business across state lines. ((Washington energy desk, 202 898 8320))
