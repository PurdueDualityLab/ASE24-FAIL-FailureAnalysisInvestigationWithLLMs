CALIFORNIA GETS GO-AHEAD

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission told California last week, as expected, it is free to go ahead with testing its new power exchange and transmission grid system Nov. 1 and operating it Jan. 1 as planned.
Although FERC made some changes to the proposals filed in August by entities in the state, it decided that in the end, ''We could argue over theory until we all run out of consultant money,'' but the historic restructuring plan generally is ''good enough for prime time,'' said commissioner Vicky Bailey. When ''inevitable glitches'' occur, Bailey said, FERC will be ready to step in and order changes or examine alternatives.
A source with the PX and ISO said FERC's order contains lists of requirements for fulfillment by Jan. 1 and afterward, but includes ''no show-stoppers.'' He called significant FERC's requirement that before Jan. 1, chief executive officers of the IOUs, PX, and ISO must certify their plans will maintain the reliability of the grid. The provision is a good example of ''cooperative federalism,'' this source said, in that federal regulators are saying, ''We are relying a great deal on your judgment and credibility.''
The California entities had not read the almost-300-page order by press time. ISO CEO Jeff Tranen said in a brief statement, however, that ''preliminary indications are that FERC has taken positions on certain issues that are contrary to California's positions -- such as the role of the Oversight Board. We will be assessing how FERC's positions can be reconciled with those of California.'' FERC affirmed its July decision that the system's Oversight Board, created by California law, has outlived its function and should be disbanded. It also affirmed its ruling that the ISO governing board must admit members from outside California; a residency requirement is untenable, the commission said.
