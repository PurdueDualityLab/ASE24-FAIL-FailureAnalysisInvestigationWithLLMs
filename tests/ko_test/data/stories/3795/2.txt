CALIF. ISO/PX GETS FERC GREEN LIGHT, WITH A STRONG MONITORING MANDATE

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission told California last week, as expected, it is free to go ahead with testing its new power exchange and transmission grid system Nov. 1 and operating it Jan. 1 as planned.
Although FERC made some changes to the proposals filed in August by entities in the state, it decided that in the end, ''We could argue over theory until we all run out of consultant money,'' but the historic restructuring plan generally is ''good enough for prime time,'' said commissioner Vicky Bailey.
Chairman James Hoecker explained that if features of the plan passed muster under the Federal Power Act, FERC did not change them to match its own preferences, but instead gave California the deference it has promised states that take restructuring action. When ''inevitable glitches'' occur, Bailey suggested, FERC will be ready to step in and order changes or examine alternatives.
A source with the PX and ISO said that FERC's order contains lists of requirements for fulfillment by Jan. 1 and afterward but includes ''no show-stoppers.'' He called significant FERC's requirement that before Jan. 1, chief executive officers of the IOUs, PX, and ISO must certify their plans will maintain the reliability of the grid. The provision is a good example of ''cooperative federalism,'' this source said, in that federal regulators are saying, ''We are relying a great deal on your judgment and credibility.''
The California entities had not read the almost-300-page order by press time. ISO CEO Jeff Tranen said in a brief statement, however, that ''preliminary indications are that FERC has taken positions on certain issues that are contrary to California's positions -- such as the role of the Oversight Board. We will be assessing how FERC's positions can be reconciled with those of California.''
FERC affirmed its July decision that the system's Oversight Board, created by California law, has outlived its function and should be disbanded. It also affirmed its ruling that the ISO governing board must admit members from outside California; a residency requirement is untenable, the commission said.
FERC's order, which gave ''conditional, interim approval'' to the overall plan (Docket No. EC96-19 et al), gave the IOUs authority to sell at market-based rates into the PX and to turn over operational control of their transmission systems to the ISO. Key to FERC's willingness to approve the plan, according to commissioner William Massey, was the divestiture by the state's investor-owned utilities of most of their generation, leaving very little that they will be able to bid into the PX: ''Divestiture is a long-term solution and one that we believe mitigates generation market power on a long-term basis,'' Massey said.
Another key to FERC's approval, Massey said, is an ''extremely important'' monitoring function that the ISO and PX will establish. ''We must rely on reports, studies, and complaints of market participants to keep us informed,'' he said. FERC asked for quarterly status reports on the plan's staged implementation; a series of studies and reports on the PX auction; a market power review; studies on congestion; and a comprehensive review after three years of operation.
Among changes FERC made was a modification in the ISO's congestion management rules. Addressing so-called ''must-run'' units that are so designated to ensure system balance, FERC said instead of having the group decide how to operate the units when there is too much generation at one time, each schedule coordinator must resolve its own overgeneration problems.
