The contractor of Taipei's Neihu mass rapid transit (MRT) line has sent a senior engineer to Taiwan to help fix the newly inaugurated system's problems, a city official said Sunday.
'The engineer from Canada-based Bombardier Inc. arrived in Taipei a day after the system suffered a sudden power outage that forced an overnight shutdown of the line, ' said Tan Kuo-kuang, the Taipei city government's deputy secretary-general who concurrently serves as spokesman for the administration's emergency response task force.
Frequent false alarms and malfunctions have hampered the operation of the new MRT line, which is connected with the 12-year-old Muzha line.
Its most serious glitch occurred Friday, when the system's power supply suffered an apparent malfunction. The failure affected 21 trains carrying more than 9,000 passengers on the Neihu/Muzha line, including 700 on three trains that were left stranded between stations. Services were not resumed until 6 a.m. the following day.
'Preliminary investigations show that Friday's mishap was caused by the breakdown of an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system at the line's Zhongshan Junior High School station, which cut off all signals and communications along the line, ' Tang explained, adding that a back-up electric circuit will be installed to improve the UPS system's reliability.
The installation project will take two to three months to complete, Tan added.
Asked whether the city government will seek compensation from the contractor, Tan said the city government's top priority is to maintain the line's normal operations and reliability.
However, he noted that acceptance testing for the Neihu line has not yet been completed.
According to the city's contract with Bombardier, the system's reliability must reach 99 percent within eight months of the start of operations.
'We will require the contractor to strengthen its reliability testing to achieve the stated goal as soon as possible, ' Tan said, adding that whether the contractor can achieve this goal within the required timeframe will be one of the criteria used by the city government when deciding whether or not to seek compensation.
