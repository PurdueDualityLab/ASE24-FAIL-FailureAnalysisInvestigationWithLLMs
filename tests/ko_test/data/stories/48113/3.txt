The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Tuesday:
United Daily News: On opening Taiwan to Chinese capital
The government's latest liberalization move to open Taiwan to Chinese capital has raised apprehension about the possibility of creating a bubble economy and making Taiwan overreliant on China. While such apprehension is inevitable, the government should transform the apprehension into momentum to upgrade Taiwan's competitiveness.
So far, the government has not presented any analytical report that is sufficient to prove that it is prepared for these scenarios. An unsubstantiated guarantee and a wait-and-see strategy cannot resist any real attacks.
The apprehension probably stems from a lack of confidence in Taiwan's economic competitiveness. With competitiveness, Taiwan will be able to take advantage of Chinese capital, rather than being taken advantage of by Chinese capital.
Liberty Times: On the launch of Taipei Metro's Neihu line
The crowded and chaotic scenes following the recent launch of the Neihu line of Taipei's metro system demonstrate that there is a serious problem with the governance of the capital city. Only if we face up to mistakes honestly will the development of the city and the country get back on track.
The line, which includes stops in Songshan Airport, Nangang Software Park and Taipei Nangang Exhibition Center, was originally aimed to serve the convenience of business people with operations in China. The train carriages, however, are so small that they can hardly accommodate the passenger flow in peak hours, not to mention providing room for luggage. This raises suspicion of negligence and irregularities behind the project.
Looking beyond the Neihu line project, we wonder if anyone in the country is monitoring the huge public construction projects launched over the past year by the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou -- formerly mayor of Taipei. If we cannot even prevent rigging in a small metro project, corruption will definitely prevail.
Apple Daily: On crisis management
The fact that the Taiwan branch of computer vendor Dell has experienced two glitches involving its online sales platform in 11 days indicates that there are serious flaws in the company's management.
The company's refusal to honor orders affected by the glitches has severely damaged the company's credibility. Also, the company's slow response to the errors has hurt consumer trust in its crisis management.
Crisis management is also required in the government. The Dell case should be a lesson for civil servants to improve their response and efficiency.
China Times: On the potential fiscal crisis of a graying society
The International Monetary Fund has warned of the huge financial costs following the retirement of the baby-boom generation. In Taiwan, the population has also been graying rapidly in recent years. Is the government prepared for the resulting fiscal land mine?
The Council for Economic Planning and Development has predicted that by 2050, those aged 65 and older will account for more than 30 percent of Taiwan's population, making the country the world's second grayest society after Japan. By 2051, the ratio between the 15-64 age group and those aged 65 and older is expected to reach 1.5:1.
We urge the government to responsibly introduce substantive measures to improve the worsening fiscal dilemma and seek to slow down the speed of the population's aging. Once the fiscal land mine explodes, the consequences will be unthinkable.
