Taipei Mayor Hao Lung-bin publicly apologized for the suspension of service on the city's Neihu/Muzha mass rapid transit line Friday, and said if the shutdown was caused by system failure, the city would seek damages from the system's contractor, Canada-based Bombardier Inc.
Operations of the newly-inaugurated line were shut down Friday at 3: 30 p.m. when the power supply system apparently malfunctioned. Twenty-one trains were running at the time, and 700 passengers were forced to get off three of the trains that were stuck between stations.
Hao insisted that the city government cares for the safety of passengers, and he apologized for the inconvenience caused by the malfunction.
The city government has demanded that service resumes Saturday at 6 a.m., he said.
Though not the first time that trains on the MRT line were forced to stop in the middle of their runs because of glitches since the system formally opened last Saturday, Friday's incident was by far the most serious.
The Neihu Line is a medium capacity system connecting the Muzha Line's Zhongshan Junior High School station to the Nangang Line's Nangang Exhibition Center. Apart from the Songshan Airport and Dazhi stations, the entire Neihu Line runs above ground.
