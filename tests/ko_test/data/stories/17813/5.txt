Japanese organizers of the 2002 World Cup have received more than 1.7 million applications for 221,000 tickets made available to the general public in this soccer-crazy country, a national newspaper said Saturday.
With fans requesting an average of 10 tickets each, that makes about 80 would-be buyers for every ticket, the Yomiuri newspaper reported. A drawing will be held in June to determine who ends up with them.
But public response reportedly fell short of forecasts, in part because computer glitches caused delays in plans to accept ticket orders over the Internet.
The Japan World Cup Organizing Committee also announced Friday that it had received about 2.4 million requests for all categories of tickets during a first round of applications between February 15 and March 14, the Yomiuri newspaper and other news media reported.
That figure included orders for tickets reserved for corporate sponsors and soccer officials. The reports did not specify the total number of tickets available in all categories in the first round.
Japan is co-hosting the first-ever soccer World Cup to played in Asia with neighbor South Korea. Japanese organizers have been allocated a total of 630,000 tickets for the 32 matches to be held in this country, which will be sold in two rounds.
Fewer than half have been earmarked for ordinary fans, and Friday's numbers showed that the odds of getting into a match are razor thin.
Overwhelming as they seem at first glance, the 2.4 million requests JAWOC received for all categories of tickets was less than half of the 5 million initially projected, national broadcaster NHK said.
JAWOC blamed the last-minute technical malfunction by soccer's governing body FIFA for prevented organizers in both Japan and South Korea from launching Internet ticketing services at the same time as they began accepting mail-in applications.
Only 100,161 requests were made online, the Yomiuri reported. A second allotment of 63,000 tickets will be offered to the general public early next year.
Tickets for the 32-nation, 64-game tournament are priced between dlrs 60 and dlrs 750, depending on the round and location.
Telephone calls to JAWOC went unanswered Saturday morning.
