Tokyo, Apr 12 (EFE).- A computer glitch has forced Japanese soccer authorities to delay the availability of online volunteer applications for 2002 World Cup final-round matches in Japan, Japanese tournament organizers said Thursday.
The problem marks the second major computer-related snafu to beset the Japanese World Cup Organizing Committee (JAWOC) efforts.
Japanese organizers said the problem was caused by software licensing problems involving ISL, the marketing company for FIFA, world soccer's governing body.
In February, JAWOC had to postpone the availability of online ticket requests for World Cup matches and later, in March, the committee's computer was overloaded by ticket requests on the last day ticket application requests could be submitted online.
JAWOC also said on Tuesday that it would delay selecting the security firm that will handle next year's World Cup.
The committee was forced to push back its April 15 deadline on account of the large number of applications received.
"On account of the large number of applications, we are having a hard time making the best choice. I don't think it's a problem that can't wait a little longer," said Takahisa Ishida, the head of security for JAWOC.
The committee is also expected to decide soon on banning smoking or alcohol sales at soccer's crowning event.
