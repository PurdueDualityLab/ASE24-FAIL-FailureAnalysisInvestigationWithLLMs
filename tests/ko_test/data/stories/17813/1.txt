SOGWIPO, South Korea, April 4 --
FIFA on Wednesday sought to reassure 2002 World Cup hosts Japan and South Korea that ISL, the marketing company for soccer's world governing body, will not go under, despite filing for bankruptcy last month.
At a meeting with Japanese (JAWOC) and South Korean (KOWOC) organizers in Sogwipo, one of South Korea's 10 World Cup venues, FIFA general secretary Michel Zen-Ruffinen asked the co-hosts to adopt a "wait-and-see" approach to the ISL problem.
Zen-Ruffinen said that ISL is planning an alliance with new partners in order to stave off bankruptcy and urged JAWOC and KOWOC not to panic.
However, JAWOC secretary general Yasuhiko Endo was still left grumbling about the knock-on effect the latest hitch -- coming after a computer glitch delayed domestic online ticket applications in February -- could have on Japanese preparations for the World Cup.
"We had all those problems with the ticket applications and now it looks like volunteers will have to apply by post too," said Endo, referring to further computer delays expected as a result of the current latest problems.
The draw for the May-June Confederations Cup, to be staged in Japan and South Korea as a rehearsal for the World Cup, was scheduled to be held in Sogwipo later on Wednesday.
