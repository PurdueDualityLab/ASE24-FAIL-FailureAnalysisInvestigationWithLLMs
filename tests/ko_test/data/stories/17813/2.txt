JAPANESE organisers of the 2002 World Cup have received more than 1.7 million applications for 221,000 tickets made available to the general public in the soccer-crazy country.
Fans have requested an average of 10 tickets each which makes 80 would-be buyers for every ticket. A draw will be held in June to determine who ends up with them.
But public response fell short of forecasts, in part because computer glitches caused delays in plans to accept ticket orders over the Internet.
Japan is co-hosting the first-ever soccer World Cup to be played in Asia with neighbour South Korea. Japanese organisers have been allocated 630,000 tickets for the 32 matches to be held there.
