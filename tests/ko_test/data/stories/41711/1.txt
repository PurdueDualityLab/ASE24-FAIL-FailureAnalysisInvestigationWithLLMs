THE management of Thai AirAsia, the budget airline previously jointly owned by Shin Corp and Malaysia's AirAsia, have increased their stake to 51 per cent, they said yesterday.
The managers, led by Thai AirAsia chief executive Tassapon Bijleveld, had earlier held just a one per cent stake in the airline.
The deal is likely to clear the air about the nationality of Thai AirAsia, which has been under investigation by Thai authorities. The airline stake was part of the Shin Corp package which the family of ousted prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra sold to Temasek Holdings of Singapore.
The management buyout is worth a little less than one billion baht ($48S million), which will be financed by a loan from Credit Suisse. The half-share of the airline was in the hands of a Shin Corp subsidiary company called Air Aviation, which is now to be wholly owned by the managers. Under the terms of the deal, they are required to divest their shares in a public offering after three years.
The management had earlier planned to buy 49 per cent of Asia Aviation from Shin for 472 million baht, with Shin talking to Thai investor Sittichai Veerathammanon about buying the remaining 51 per cent.
Malaysia's AirAsia still owns the remaining 49 per cent stake in its Thai partner airline. With the ownership issue apparently resolved, Mr Tassapon said that Thai AirAsia should record a net profit of between 150 to 200 million baht this year, up from the 50 million baht seen in 2006. He said that in the future of the airline now looks brighter and that his aim was to lease 40 new Airbus A320 aircraft. The first of these 40 new aircraft is set to be delivered by October.
Meanwhile the new Suvarnabhumi airport in Bangkok saw another glitch in which most of the luggage scanners failed, thus paralysing the conveyor belt system and requiring bags to be shifted by hand. Extra staff, including army personnel, were called in.
Suvarnabhumi airport is equipped with 26 CTX machines supplied by GE InVision of the US. Four of these were already out of action and a further 13 failed yesterday, Saprang Kalayanamitr, chairman of Airports of Thailand. 'Technicians are trying to fix them as quickly as possible,' he said.
The airport, which opened last September, has been facing various problems and is still repairing cracks on taxiways and runways caused by underground water. The company had to reopen the 93-year-old Don Muang airport in March to alleviate congestion caused by faults at the new facility.
