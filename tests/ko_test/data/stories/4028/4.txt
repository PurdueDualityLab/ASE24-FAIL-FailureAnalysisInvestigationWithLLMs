WASHINGTON -- Senior citizens will miss out on as much as $570 million in savings on their Medicare co-payments because of delays while the government fixes a glitch that threatens to shut down computers on Jan. 1, 2000. Elderly and disabled Americans covered by Medicare pay 20 percent of the bills for most medical care out of their own pockets or by buying private supplemental insurance. But an accounting problem has stuck them with 50 percent of the bill, on average, for tests, one-day surgeries and rehabilitation services received in hospital outpatient clinics. Congress and the Clinton administration agreed last year that Medicare should correct the problem in 1999 by taking over a slightly bigger share of outpatient bills each year until retirees co-payments are down to the usual 20 percent. "Mismanagement . . . is undoing the bipartisan agreement and taking money out of the pockets of our nation's seniors and disabled citizens," Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., wrote in an Aug. 28 letter to the administration. Thomas heads the House Ways and Means Committee's health subcommittee that oversees Medicare. Yesterday Thomas' office released an internal Medicare memo estimating the lost savings to the elderly at $570 million if co-payment corrections are postponed until April 2000.
