EDITORIALS; Today's debate: Medicare and Y2K; OUR VIEW: Data processing problems ignored for too long; patients will pay. Among the many contenders for the title of most troublesome Y2K crisis, Medicare is a front-runner. The program is the largest health insurer in the country. By the year 2000, it will handle one billion claims worth more than $288 billion on behalf of almost 40 million elderly and disabled Americans. So you can imagine what would happen if Medicare's computers failed because they had not been reprogrammed to accept data after the year 2000. Providers would not be paid. Medical records would be unavailable. New enrollees would be left in limbo. Plainly, the Health Care Financing Administration, which oversees Medicare, should be charging the Y2K problem at warp speed. Instead, it has barely hitched the oxen to the cart. Indeed, Congress' General Accounting Office recently concluded that "it is highly unlikely that all Medicare systems will be compliant on time to ensure the delivery of uninterrupted benefits and services into the year 2000." One major obstacle is the complexity of Medicare's network. It uses seven different data processing systems, nine databases and scores of independent contractors to manage claims and payments among millions of patients, providers, insurers and banks. The system is so intricate, HCFA experts don't even know how many data-exchange links they have, only that there are more than 200,000. Medicare officials insist they have made more headway than the GAO gives them credit. But even if all of Medicare's internal systems are renovated on schedule, there's little evidence that validating and implementing the fixes on 50 million lines of date-sensitive code can be completed on time. Officials also say the systems used by their contractors are 90% renovated. But the GAO report suggests the reliability of that work is questionable. In one case, a contractor found that even after reprogramming, as much as 14% of the date codes had not been properly corrected. Already the Y2K problem is causing trouble. For example, Medicare has identified an accounting problem that more than doubles the co-payments paid by some beneficiaries. But money to fix that problem has been diverted to remedy the Y2K glitch. The ensuing delay could cost seniors $570 million. According to a recent survey, officials at most federal agencies think the Y2K problem stifles creativity and obstructs other projects. Medicare, unable to correct its billing programs because of the demands of date-code work, is proof of that. But the problem isn't just that Y2K is an albatross. The problem is that agencies have ignored the hanging carcass for so long. Most agencies also say they are well on the way to fixing the problem. You can only hope they say so with more authority than the happy-face overseers at HCFA.
