Senior citizens will miss out on as much as $570 million in savings on their Medicare copayments because of delays while the government fixes a glitch that threatens to shut down computers on Jan. 1, 2000. Elderly and disabled Americans covered by Medicare pay 20 percent of the bills for most medical care out of their own pockets or by buying private supplemental insurance. But an accounting problem has stuck them with 50 percent of the bill, on average, for tests, one-day surgeries, and rehabilitation services received in hospital outpatient clinics. Congress and the Clinton administration agreed last summer that starting in 1999 Medicare should correct the problem by taking over a slightly bigger share of the outpatient bills each year until retirees' copayments are down to the usual 20 percent. "Mismanagement . . . is undoing the bipartisan agreement and taking money out of the pockets of our nation's seniors and disabled citizens," Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., wrote in an Aug. 28 letter to the administration. Thomas heads the House Ways and Means Committee's health subcommittee that oversees Medicare. Thomas' office Monday released an internal Medicare memo estimating the lost savings to senior citizens will be $570 million if the copayment correction must be postponed until April 2000. "Beneficiaries will see only a temporary impact from the necessary delay," Medicare administrator Nancy-Ann Min DeParle responded in a statement. She added: "Medicare must deal with year 2000 compliance aggressively to ensure no interruption in our services in claim payments."
