EDITORIALS; Today's debate: Medicare and Y2K; OPPOSING VIEW: Medicare, contractors on track to meeting '99 deadline.; Nancy-Ann DeParle is administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration. Medicare beneficiaries need not worry: They'll receive health care services come Jan. 1, 2000, as they have for the past 33 years. Remember, beneficiaries get services from doctors, hospitals and other providers. Medicare pays the bills. Even in a worst-case scenario, no year 2000 glitches will keep Medicare's 38 million beneficiaries from needed care. Our challenge is different -- making sure Medicare's contractors can promptly process and pay claims, so providers do not suffer interruptions in their cash flow. As an agency, we face unique challenges. By law, most of the mission-critical computer systems that process Medicare claims are controlled and operated by more than 60 private insurance companies, not by the government. All of our critical internal systems have been renovated. Many have finished the advanced testing needed to ensure year 2000 compliance. This allows us to focus even more on speeding our contractors' efforts to complete renovation and testing of Medicare's crucial external systems. We've worked closely with them, and independent experts have found their reprogramming work is, on average, more than 90% complete. So Medicare and its contractors are on track to meet the government-imposed March 31, 1999 compliance deadline. Medicare has steadily increased the time and resources devoted to this essential mission: Following the advice of outside computer experts, we made the difficult decision to delay some critical projects that could interfere with year 2000 efforts. We established a "war room," with staff dedicated to solving problems, and have sent staff on site to monitor contractors' progress. We rehired retired federal programmers to join our compliance teams. We received additional funding in the new federal budget to support our efforts. And we are reaching out to hospitals, doctors and other health care providers, urging them to check their own computers for year 2000 compliance. After all, if a provider can't send us a bill, we can't pay it. Though we expect our aggressive actions to succeed, we are preparing contingency plans just in case. I intend to get Medicare across the finish line in time. Our beneficiaries and providers deserve nothing less.
