Despite safety concerns, Russia ready for launch

MOSCOW -- Rejecting last-minute evidence of safety risks, the United States and Russia on Wednesday are scheduled to launch the key module of the controversial International Space Station, hoping to jump-start the 16-year-old project to enable humans to permanently live and work in space.
The unmanned Russian-made Zvezda module is to lift off at 11:56 p.m. CST -- more than two years behind schedule -- from the Russian space agency's Baikonur launch site in Kazakhstan to its new home orbiting Earth. Once aloft, Zvezda -- which means 'star' in Russian -- will serve as the living quarters for crew and visitors at the space station.
Tension had built over the weekend about lingering technical problems associated with the Russian Proton booster rocket, the workhorse of Moscow's space program.
According to Russian space officials, a July 5 test launch for the Zvezda module nearly ended in disaster due to a sudden drop in pressure in the fuel tank just before the second stage engine separated from the main rocket seconds after leaving Earth.
The Proton boosters exploded twice last year shortly after take off, once in July and once in October, during attempts by the Russians to launch vessels unrelated to the space station program.
Those accidents caused a temporary suspension of all Russian space launches, as well as a great deal of sweat from NASA. The U.S. space agency has waited 27 months for the Russians to complete their assignment so that work on the space station could commence.
In addition, the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of the U.S. Congress, has warned that station crews will face increased risk and noise because of Russia's failure to meet NASA safety standards. It says the module's aluminum and magnesium skin doesn't offer strong enough protection against collisions with space junk, and its equipment will fail if cabin pressure is lost, jeopardizing the entire station.
The space station has been described variously as either the most complex and costly construction project ever attempted or NASA's biggest boondoggle. Its price tag has jumped from $8 billion, when President Ronald Reagan proposed the plan in 1984, to upwards of $100 billion today.
The Zvezda, a silver box the size of a bus, cost an estimated $350 million to design and develop.
Criticized for these lengthy delays and rising costs, NASA and the Russian space agency are under pressure to make Wednesday's launch a success.
Both agencies brushed aside the risk associated with the Proton and revelations made Friday that serious glitches occurred during the test launch.
In the wake of the 1999 explosions, both of which were attributed to problems with the Proton engine, the United States spent millions of dollars to help the Russian space agency check and upgrade the rocket's propulsion systems.
NASA spokesman Carlos Fontenot said Friday that the U.S. agency did not believe the July 5 test uncovered new problems serious enough to delay the Zvezda launch any longer.
'The Russians have given us no information to cause a reason for delay. We will proceed as planned,' Fontenot said.
Unmanned segments of the space station -- a venture among 16 nations, including Russia, the United States, Europe, Japan and Canada -- have orbited Earth since late 1998.
More than 350 feet long and more than a million pounds, the station will be four times larger than Russia's Mir space station and, like Mir, visible to the naked eye from Earth.
Also like Mir, the Russian-built portions of the station will sport advertisements from multinational corporations. On one side of the Zvezda module is a 9-by-9-foot ad for Pizza Hut covered by a special film so that it can withstand the heat of the launch and the wear and tear of space.
The ad reportedly cost Pizza Hut $1 million, and the proceeds will go to Russia's space agency and aeronautics companies.
Full assembly of the space station will require more than 80 Russian and American launches and 1,900 hours of spacewalks over the next seven years.
Zvezda will reach the space station by late July. In the next few months, four supply flights -- two by the Russians and two by the U.S. space shuttle -- will make the station ready to receive its first three-man crew, made up of both Americans and Russians, in late October.
