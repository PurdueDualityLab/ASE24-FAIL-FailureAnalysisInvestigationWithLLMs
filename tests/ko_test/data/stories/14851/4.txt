Zvezda continues to check out for ISS docking; lone glitch said minor

Russia's Zvezda Service Module continues to check out on orbit as controllers get ready for its planned July 25 automatic docking with the International Space Station, NASA said yesterday, describing as minor a problem with one of the critical module's visual docking targets.
Controllers at Mission Control Center-Moscow reported to their NASA counterparts that all systems performed nominally in a two-orbit rehearsal for the rendezvous between Zvezda and ISS that will precede the docking, scheduled for 8:53 p.m. EDT July 25. Among systems tested was the Kurs automatic docking system, which will have two chances to link the two modules already on orbit with Zvezda automatically.
Preliminary data indicated both the primary and secondary Kurs systems functioned properly, NASA said. If Kurs doesn't work next week, two cosmonauts are standing by to fly to Zvezda and manually dock it to the Station. They will use a system of three visual docking targets to guide their maneuvers, but telemetry data after Zvezda's launch last week indicated that one of the targets might not have opened as planned, according to NASA and Russian officials.
A spokesman for Johnson Space Center said yesterday the target may in fact be open, and the sensor that indicates it is closed is malfunctioning. If it is closed, Russian engineers believe there is a "good chance" it will be shaken open by the maneuvers that will take Zvezda to ISS, particularly as it reacts to the cycles of sunlight and shade in orbit.
During the rendezvous rehearsal, controllers commanded two correction burns on the Russian-built Zarya control module of about five seconds each, which raised the Station's orbit by about two miles. Plans called for a burn on Zvezda of about 15 seconds last night to continue nudging the module toward rendezvous with the Station.
Zvezda's secondary computer system has also been tested in both its primary and secondary "sets," which have both demonstrated their capability to receive commands from the ground and verify that they have done so. On Friday controllers plan to test Zvezda's docking mechanism, to verify the system's software and mechanical gear, NASA said.
