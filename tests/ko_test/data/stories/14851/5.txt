Space station module ready for launch

The space station is finally going to get its long-awaited bedrooms and kitchen following a decision Friday to roll out the Russian Zvezda space station module for launch.
The Zvezda Service Module, which has two sleeping niches, a galley and a bathroom, is set to launch on July 12. On July 25, after a series of on-orbit tests, it will dock automatically with the Zarya and Unity segments of the International Space Station (ISS) which are already in space.
The 42,000-lb Zvezda module, (zvezda is the Russian word for 'star') is an essential part of the station and the core of the Russian section.
It will provide propulsion to keep the station in proper orbit, a data processing system and ISS flight control.
The module has been delayed for two years, in part because of financial and technical problems. Mikhael Senelshchikov, chief of piloted programs at Russia's Rosaviakosmos acknowledged the problems Friday during a Moscow news conference. Valeri Ryumin, ISS program manager for Russia's RSC-Energia, downplayed 368 malfunctions uncovered during tests of the module since May. All those problems have been resolved he said.
Still to be addressed are noise and other issues stemming from the module's design.
In March, Allen Li, associate director of the U.S. General Accounting Office, told the House Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics that there were concerns that Zvezda will not meet noise limits, making it hard for the astronauts and cosmonauts to communicate.
The Service Module is essentially the same as the core of Russia's Mir space station and nearly all the cosmonauts on Mir have suffered temporary hearing loss. The hearing loss for some has been severe enough to disqualify them from future flights.
There are also questions about whether there will be enough shielding to protect Zvezda from orbital debris, said Li and whether the windows can meet either design or service-life requirements. Fixes for problems have been identified said Ryumin. Some of the fixes will not be put into place until after the launch.
Zvezda will be launched Wednesday on a Proton rocket.
Deployment of the module was further delayed when the Proton series of rockets suffered two failures last year. There have been three successful Proton launches since the failures though a question has arisen in the last few days about a problem with the most recent one. That rocket successfully put a Russian military satellite into orbit on July 5 but suffered a loss of pressure in its second stage during the launch.
Sergei Shayevich, a program manager at the Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center for the Zarya station module, said the problem was minor and had been over dramatized by the press. The glitch was fully understood and did not effect the overall functioning of the system. The problem was not related to modifications to the Proton he said.
Senelshchikov said that if the Zvezda launch did have to be delayed, the critical components could last up to a month.
The launch of Zvezda will set the stage for a series of 15 flights to the station over the next year: eight space shuttle flights, five flight Russian Progress flights and two Russian Soyuz flights.
Humans could take up permanent residence in the station starting in either late October or early November of this year.
The long-term future of Russian participation in the space station is clouded. Russian officials said Friday they would proceed with the launch of a docking module, development of pressurized and instrumented capability and their joint project with Spacehab. Spacehab is paying pay roughly half the cost of the Enterprise module, which will house lockers, research bays and the first on-orbit broadcast facility.
Any activity beyond these areas, however, depends on funding and that is unclear said one Russian official.
