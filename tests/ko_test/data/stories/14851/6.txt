MOSCOW Rejecting last-minute evidence of potential safety risks, the United States and Russia on Wednesday are scheduled to launch the key module of the controversial International Space Station, hoping to jump-start the 16-year-old project that would allow humans to permanently live and work in space.
The Russian-made Zvezda module is to lift off at 12:56 a.m. EDT (9:56 p.m. PDT today) more than two years behind the original schedule at the Russian space agency's Baikonur launch site in Kazakhstan to its new home orbiting Earth. Once aloft, it will serve as the living quarters for crew and visitors at the space station.
Tension had built over the weekend about lingering technical problems associated with the Russian Proton booster rocket, the workhorse of Moscow's space program.
According to Russian space officials, a July 5 test launch for the Zvezda module nearly ended in disaster due to a sudden drop in pressure in the fuel tank just before the second stage engine broke off of the main rocket seconds after leaving the Earth.
The Proton boosters exploded twice last year shortly after take-off, once in July and once in October, during attempts by the Russians to launch vessels unrelated to the space station program.
Those explosions caused a temporary suspension of all Russian space launches as well as a great deal of sweat from NASA, which has waited 27 months for the Russians to complete their assignment so that work could commence at the ISS.
The space station has been described variously as either the most complex and costly construction project ever attempted or NASA's biggest boondoggle. Its price tag has jumped from $8 billion when President Reagan proposed the plan in 1984 to upward of $100 billion today.
Criticized for these lengthy delays and rising costs, NASA and the Russian space agency were under enormous pressure to make Wednesday's launch a success.
Both agencies brushed aside the risk associated with the Proton and revelations made Friday that serious glitches occurred during the test launch.
The Proton was the rocket used to launch Zvezda, a silver-shaped box the size of a large tour bus that cost an estimated $350 million to design and develop.
In the wake of the 1999 explosions, both of which were attributed to problems with the Proton engine, the United States spent millions of dollars to help the Russian space agency check and upgrade the rocket's propulsion systems.
NASA spokesman Carlos Fontenot said Friday the U.S. agency did not believe the July 5 test uncovered new problems serious enough to delay the Zvezda launch any longer.
'The Russians have given us no information to cause a reason for delay. We will proceed as planned,' Fontenot said.
Unmanned segments of the ISS a venture grouping Russia, the United States, Europe, Japan and Canada have orbited Earth since late 1998.
More than 350 feet in length and weighing more than a million pounds, the ISS will be four times larger than Russia's Mir space station and, like Mir, visible to the naked eye from Earth.
Also like Mir, the Russian-built portions of the ISS will be sporting advertisements from various multinational corporations. Alongside of the Zvezda module is painted a 9-by-9-foot ad for Pizza Hut covered by a special film so that the design and lettering can withstand the heat of the launch and wear and tear of space.
The ad reportedly cost $1 million, and the proceeds will go to Russia's space agency and aeronautic companies.
Full assembly of the ISS will require more than 80 Russian and American launches and 1,900 hours of spacewalks over the next seven years.
Zvezda will reach the space station by late July. In the next few months, four supply flights two by the Russians and two by the U.S. space shuttle will make the station ready to receive its first three-man crew, comprised of both Americans and Russians, in late October.
