3 governors asking FairPoint to keep customers in mind

ln
Oct. 22--The governors of New Hampshire, Maine and Vermont sent a joint letter to FairPoint Communications on Wednesday urging the troubled telephone company to keep the welfare of its customers a top priority as it contemplates bankruptcy.
Any debt restructuring plan FairPoint pursues should honor to the commitments the company has made to improve customer service, update infrastructure and expand broadband to rural areas, the letter said.
'We seek to ensure that any financial restructuring of FairPoint will not result in further erosion of the services you provide, nor adversely impact the commitments that FairPoint made when it was granted licences to operate in our three states,' it said.
The letter is the latest in a series of stern warnings FairPoint has received since taking over Verizon's landline and Internet business in the three states, but the first directly from the executive level. Most of the scrutiny thus far has come from public utilities regulators in all three states who are closely monitoring the company's health.
FairPoint officially took the reins from Verizon in late January after the $2.4 billion sale, but was quickly plagued with massive customer service complaints, billing errors and e-mail glitches. Although the bulk of those complaints have subsided, FairPoint is now in serious financial trouble. The company has defaulted on its loans and will have to file for bankruptcy unless it can strike a deal with its creditors by month's end.
Meanwhile, FairPoint is losing land-line customers -- and thus, revenue -- faster than anticipated. Amid all the problems, it has suspended the celebrated launch of a TV service to compete with cable.
The letter from the governors, addressed to FairPoint CEO David Hauser, emphasized that the three states have entrusted FairPoint with an important public asset and are relying on the company to keep its promises, despite the debt situation.
'Our concern is that the outcome of those negotiations might have a profound effect on telephone service and future investments in telecommunications infrastructure, which are so important to the businesses and citizens in our states.'
