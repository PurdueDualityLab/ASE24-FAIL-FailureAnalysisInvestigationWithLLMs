FairPoint files for bankruptcy

Oct. 27--The news that New Hampshire's biggest telephone company has entered bankruptcy after a year of tumult raises more questions than answers. The only thing that's certain is that the dial tone will remain.
'The most important thing for you to know is that we are not going out of business,' FairPoint CEO David Hauser said Monday in a conference call with reporters. 'I'm confident FairPoint will emerge as a stronger, more viable company.'
Monday's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing was not unexpected; the company has warned for months that it was possible. Chapter 11 allows a company to remain in business while a court reorganizes its debt.
The plan will reduce FairPoint's debt load by $1.7 billion, or nearly two-thirds, but give lenders nearly full equity ownership of the company.
New Hampshire Consumer Advocate Meredith Hatfield, a long-time critic of the FairPoint deal, told The Associated Press on Monday that because the company has a line of credit for operating expenses, customers should not worry about their phone service. The company has secured a $75 million credit line while in bankruptcy court, in addition to the $46 million in cash it has on hand.
Hatfield said there are a lot of uncertainties about how the bankruptcy proceeding affects the role of state regulators, who have legal oversight on the telephone business. It is extremely unusual for a regulated utility to go into bankruptcy.
It has been a rocky nine months since FairPoint officially broke ties with Verizon after spending $2.4 billion for its landline operations in New Hampshire, Maine and Vermont. The sale catapulted the Charlotte, N.C.-based FairPoint from a tiny carrier specializing in rural telephone and broadband service to the seventh-largest telecom company in the United States.
Not long after 'cutover' from Verizon billing and computer systems began in late January, FairPoint was inundated with customer complaints about e-mail glitches, spotty service, billing errors and long delays to fill service orders or fix problems. The company couldn't handle the volume of calls coming in, so some customers waited for hours on hold or were never able to get through for help. Problems were so bad that regulators in all three northern New England stepped in. Vermont has gone so far as to warn that it might yank FairPoint's license to operate in that state.
FairPoint says its inability to make debt payments stems both from the millions of dollars spent on the cutover and the recession, which raised interest on its bond payments. In late September, FairPoint announced that it had defaulted on bank loans and had warned that it would have to file for bankruptcy by the end of October if it failed to reach a private restructuring agreement with its creditors.
Chapter 11 bankruptcy allows a company to remain in business while the court helps to reorganize debt. Unlike Chapter 7, which liquidates the assets of a company, it does not mean a company is going out of business.
The bankruptcy filing in U.S. Court for the Southern District of New York lists scores of creditors owed more than $619 million. Most of that, $517 million, goes to the banks holding the company's loans, but other creditors include New Hampshire Electric Co-Operative, Anthem Blue Cross-Blue Shield's New Hampshire office, and a North Billerica, Mass., firm that provides telephone poles.
FairPoint CEO Hauser said the company filed for bankruptcy in New York because it is the 'financial hub' of the country, where bankruptcy proceedings are routine and handled quickly. It is not unusual for large bankruptcy cases to be filed in New York, regardless of where a company is based.
An initial hearing is scheduled for 1 p.m. today, and FairPoint expects to file its reorganization plan within 45 days. Hauser said the company should emerge from bankruptcy 'in a matter of months.'
Gov. John Lynch, Attorney General Michael Delaney, and Public Utilities Commission Chairman Tom Getz released a statement Monday morning saying the state would intervene and 'actively participate' in the FairPoint reorganization, 'in order to protect the interests of New Hampshire businesses, consumers, and workers.'
Hauser said eliminating $1.7 billion in debt will free up more capital for the company to continue to invest into broadband technologies. The company is counting on increased broadband revenue to make up for the decline in the voice and telephone portion of the business. In addition to a $27 million loss in the second quarter of this year, FairPoint lost 3 percent of its landline customers between March 31 and June 30. Although some decline in telephone customers is expected as households continue to 'cut the cord' and move to cell phones, the company also lost 1.6 percent of its Internet customers.
FairPoint is not the only telephone company struggling with declining revenues. Hawaii Telecom, which bought Verizon's landline business in Hawaii in 2005, has also filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
Verizon itself is also struggling with shrinking the landline business, although it has Verizon Wireless, which continues to grow, to make up the difference.The company announced Monday that it saw a dip in third-quarter profits due to a nearly 5 percent decline in landline revenue.
Verizon has been trying to get out of the landline business in rural areas for many years. Following the Hawaii and Northern New England deals, Verizon announced plans last spring to sell its landlines in 14 states to a company called Frontier. That $8.6 billion deal is being examined by regulators in all those states.
The Frontier deal is controversial in the wake of financial troubles from the two smaller deals. Opponents are arguing that Frontier doesn't have the resources to take over such a large operation -- the same argument that was made when FairPoint first announced plans to buy Verizon's northern New England assets.
State regulators in New Hampshire, Maine and Vermont said they took into account FairPoint's size and relative inexperience when approving the deal, but also had to consider the fact that Verizon wanted out of the landline business in the region and had already stopped investing in local infrastructure.
The two unions that represent most FairPoint workers have predicted bankruptcy for some months now and have argued since the sale was announced that FairPoint lacked the resources for a successful takeover of Verizon's assets. They waged an aggressive 'Stop the Sale' campaign during the year state regulators were weighing the deal.
The unions issued a statement Friday in anticipation of the bankruptcy announcement warning that the interests of FairPoint customers could take a back seat to the interests of Wall Street with the company's creditors in control of the company. The union also said it shouldn't be asked to make concessions when employees are not to blame for the company's debt problems. FairPoint is currently in discussions with the unions to renegotiate employee contracts amid the financial trouble.
Hauser said FairPoint's creditors have the same interest in expanding broadband and investing in the company to see that it grows.
Monday's filing prompted the New York Stock Exchange to suspend trading in the company's stock. The company was notified last month that its stock could be removed from the exchange because the price had fallen below $1 a share for 30 consecutive trading days.
