Business As Usual?: FairPoint Needs to Do Better

When it comes to the fine art of issuing soothing public statements in the midst of a debacle, FairPoint CEO David Hauser has some work to do. In fact, his comments on Monday, after the communications company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, provide a great model for what not to say.
"From a customer point of view, this is a nonevent," said Hauser in a conference call after the utility, which provides land-line and Internet service in Northern New England, filed for protection from its creditors.
The message that Hauser thought he was delivering, of course, is that FairPoint's customers shouldn't overly concern themselves: Even though the company is so financially compromised that it needs court protection while it restructures its debt, customers won't notice a bit of difference.
But "more of the same" is the last thing FairPoint customers want to hear. What the company has delivered since it acquired Verizon's land-line business in the three northern New England states is mostly empty promises to improve its poor customer service. Yes, there's still a dial tone when people pick up the phone (or, more importantly for some, a DSL light flashing on the modem), but that doesn't necessarily mean they'll be properly billed for the service or get prompt help when the service isn't what they expected.
The Chapter 11 filing was unsurprising on a couple of levels. The company's dire financial situation has been apparent for several months now, and company officials and state regulators had openly discussed the likelihood that bankruptcy court was in the offing. But even back in 2007, when FairPoint, a company with 975 employees and 300,000 access lines, proposed acquiring a telephone business with 3,000 employees and 1.6 million access lines, many observers expressed skepticism about whether the smaller company was sufficiently capitalized and experienced to pull it off.
Even after FairPoint filed for court protection, defenders of the sale were not ready to concede that they had miscalculated. The problem, they say, wasn't that FairPoint bit off more than it could chew, but that a credit crisis saddled the company with borrowing rates that exceeded 13 percent -- the company had assumed around 8 percent -- which completely altered cash flow requirements. When technical glitches plagued the switchover from Verizon computers to FairPoint's system, the resulting billing and order-fulfillment problems drove away customers, further eroding its financial stability.
"Hindsight is a wonderful thing, and if we'd known all these things back then, I'm sure there would've been a different decision," said Maine Public Advocate Richard Davies about regulators' decision to approve the acquisition.
Yes, but foresight is an even more wonderful thing, especially for regulators and corporate strategists: It prompts them to consider worst-case scenarios before assenting to a plunge into the unknown.
But that's all irrelevant now, particularly in light of the fact that there isn't a lot of competition in the communications industry to enter the land-line business. Land lines may be a fading technology, but they still provide an essential service to many of FairPoint's remaining customers. Those people still dependent on their old-fashioned telephone service -- not to mention FairPoint's employees, creditors and investors -- still have much at stake in the company eventually finding its footing.
That's why it would have been more reassuring to hear the CEO say that the bankruptcy filing was a crucial event that would be impossible for FairPoint customers not to notice -- because company officials expected it to mark a big step toward establishing a healthy company that efficiently provides reliable service.
