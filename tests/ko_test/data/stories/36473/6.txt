I'm not dead, yet

HAMILTON (CP) -- Lloyd MacEachern says rumours of his death have been greatly exaggerated.
The 78-year-old Hamilton pensioner was shocked when he found out last week that his $684 monthly pension and $434 Old Age Security cheques weren't in his bank because he'd died.
'I called and told them I'm not dead, far from it,' MacEachern said Monday.
'I am very much alive, I play in a band and everything else,' the retired ironworker added.
What happened to MacEachern 'is very rare,' federal officials said.
But they admitted it happens occasionally as Service Canada processes almost 100 million payments worth $4.5 billion a year.
MacEachern and his wife Alice, 72, have no idea how he ended up deceased.
MacEachern said the glitch that made him 'deceased' has left him in a financial bind.
'I've got to borrow money or something to pay my hydro bill, my taxes, my Star Choice and overdraft at the bank,' he said.
A daughter has offered to spot him some cash in the meantime.
Brodie Harrington of Service Canada said the agency handles more than 10,000 notices of death a month.
'That's an idea of the volume we deal with,' Harrington said. 'Errors do happen. We're all human beings.'
