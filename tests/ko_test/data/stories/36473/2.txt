Rumours of Lloyd MacEachern's death have been greatly exaggerated.
The 78-year-old Hamiltonpensioner was shocked when he found out Friday his $684 monthly pension and $434 Old Age Security cheques weren't in his bank because he'd died.
"I called and told them I'm not dead, far from it," Lloyd said yesterday.
"I am very much alive, I play in a band and everything else," the feisty retired ironworker added.
Federal officials say what happened to Lloyd "is very rare."
But they admit it happens occasionally as Service Canada processes almost 100 million payments worth $4.5 billion a year.
Lloyd and his wife Alice, 72, have no idea how he ended up deceased.
No one has died in his family recently so there's little chance of a mixup there.
So he called and afriendly voice at Service Canada's regional office in Sudbury told him a computer record listed him as "deceased" and it must be a glitch.
"It leaves me in ajackpot, I've got to borrow money or something to pay my hydro bill, my taxes, my Star Choice and overdraft at the bank," he said yesterday.
Lloyd will have the money in his bank account by Monday and a daughter has offered to spot him some cash in the meantime.
Brodie Harrington, seniordirector of operations for Service Canada, the delivery arm of Social Development Canada which handles federal pensions, said he cannot discuss individual pensions but there are several ways a mistake could be made.
Service Canada suspendsan account as soon as a death is reported to them, he said. That way officials do not have to go back to a grieving family later and ask for money back. They will suspend an account on a phone call from a relative or a funeral home but demand proof, a death certificate and date of death, be forwarded before an account is completely cancelled.
"In any month, we get more than 10,000 notices of death," said Harrington. "That's an idea of the volume we deal with.
"Errors do happen. We're all human beings.
"As soon as we find outthere's been an error, we do everything we can to get it back on track immediately and have things right in five to 10 days."
The agency relies onaccurate information and sometimes family members, funeral homes and others don't get all the details correct, he said. Service Canada may get the right name but the wrong social insurance number, or it may get the right number and an incorrect spelling of a name.
"This kind of error is a very unusual occurrence.
"Whenever there is anerror, we act immediately to rectify it. We always say to the person that we are terribly sorry and we apologize."
Lloyd worked in highsteel for "40 odd years," married Alice during a two-year job on the first Burlington Skyway bridge, raised four daughters and dotes on four grandsons, owns his own home and drives "everywhere."
He has seen a lot in life but never anything likes this.
"Did you ever hear the like of that?" he asks. "Being thought dead when you're not dead?"
