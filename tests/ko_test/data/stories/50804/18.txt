First commute on new LRT line right on track
EDMONTON - South-side LRT passengers got a smooth ride Monday morning on the first commute since the extension to Southgate and Century Park opened during the weekend, but it wasn't a glitch-free travel day for drivers.
Some drivers on 51st Avenue had to wait several traffic light changes before they could cross 111th Street due to a timing issue, said transportation general manager Bob Boutilier.
Boutilier heard of some motorists being stuck for 10 minutes because turn signals weren't properly coordinated with train movements, but said staff were out in the morning looking at ways to fix the problem.
'I'm sure there were some people disappointed they had to sit out there because they missed out on their turn to cross the tracks.'
It may take a day or two to find the proper configuration, said Boutilier, who rode the LRT downtown from his south-side home.
Coun. Don Iveson said transportation operations had just about the entire staff monitoring the new stations Monday.
The city spent many months tweaking the system when the LRT extension to McKernan/Belgravia and South Campus stations opened last April, Iveson said.
'I do expect there will be some disruptions and some changes but the good news is it should get better,' he said.
Boutilier said everything else worked fine. He was surprised to see the 1,230-stall Century Park parking lot filled, expecting this level of interest wouldn't develop for at least a week. This could mean 'exciting times' in September, when transit ridership typically spikes as students return to class, he said.
People packed the trains at the height of the commute; it was standing-room only on train cars leaving the new stations between 7:20 a.m. and 8 a.m.
The full trains were a good sign for Iveson, who said the LRT will be able to run with four or five cars instead of three once some platforms are lengthened by the end of the year.
'It's definitely way more convenient,' said Robyn Volk, who drove to the Century Park park-and-ride from her home in Ellerslie Crossing. The LRT won't reduce her commute time to downtown by much, but she'll have a more relaxing trip to the city's core, she said.
Some drivers accidentally drove through the bus lanes at Century Park to get to the park-and-ride, but LRT inspector Sheri Alexander expects small problems such as these to disappear in the next few days.
Alexander spent her morning directing passengers at the Century Park platform. 'It's going good for the first day,' she said. 'It's been pretty smooth.'
A few new riders expressed frustration when the trains left them behind on the platform, Alexander said. Even if people miss the train, the next one arrives in five minutes during peak times, she said.
'They have to understand the train has to leave at some point,' she said.
People crowded around route maps at the stations and asked other riders and transit staff what stations to get off at downtown.
'I'm just following people I see on my bus,' said Robin Wilms, who used to take the bus to work at 101st Street and 103rd Avenue. 'I'm hoping to save time. It seems fairly seamless.'
