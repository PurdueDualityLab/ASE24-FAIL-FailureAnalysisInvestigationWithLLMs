Traffic troubles continue on LRT route
Tuesday was another frusturating morning for motorists commuting near the new south LRT line. It's the second full operational day for the new stations, and while all is well for LRT passengers, it's a different story for drivers waiting at train crossings.
A glitch with the traffic lights at the intersection of 111th street and 51st avenue caused delays of six minutes or longer for drivers travelling east or west through the intersection.
