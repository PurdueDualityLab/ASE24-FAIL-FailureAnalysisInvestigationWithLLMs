Re: "Glitch snarls traffic at busy LRT crossing; Bad timing creates 'perfect storm' for motorists, city official admits," The Journal, April 28.
After having to live through the debacle the city created at 114th Street and University Avenue with the LRT, I shuddered when I saw their comical plans for the traffic light sequencing on the much more complicated 51st Avenue and 111th Street intersection.
What world do these project designers live in? It was obvious that longtime residents were going to have trouble with the convoluted intersection; I pity the poor tourist.
There are rail systems all over the world which have to stop and wait for right of way, along with the traffic. If the city were smart enough and forward thinking (I know, now I'm riding on Michael Jackson's ferris wheel), the trains would have stopped for the red lights at these two intersections.
All the complications and expense would have been forgone and we would only be looking at a minuscule delay for the trains, as they'd have zero traffic to wait on. Oh well, why make life simple when you can just clutter it up with confusion?
