Re: "Glitch snarls traffic at busy LRT crossing; Bad timing creates 'perfect storm' for motorists, city official admits," The Journal, April 28.
I find it unbelievable that Edmonton's Transportation Department failed to foresee the traffic nightmare created at 51st Avenue and 111 Street in extending the LRT line to Southgate and beyond.
They didn't even need computer simulations or an ounce of common sense. All they had to do was ask any resident of Belgravia or McKernan, who has sat through endless lights trying to get across 114th Street.
I find it even more astounding that the only solution they can propose is "avoid that intersection at busy times."
I submit that a bright, 12-year-old child with a $30 microcontroller could set up a better traffic control scheme than the city has implemented along the south LRT extension.
The LRT and other traffic can coexist peacefully, if we don't try to orchestrate them with thinking and technology from the 1960s.
