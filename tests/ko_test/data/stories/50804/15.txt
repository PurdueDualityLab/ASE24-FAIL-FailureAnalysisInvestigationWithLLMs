New traffic-light patterns causing backups; City struggles to solve LRT intersection problem
EDMONTON - Drivers who have waited up to 26 minutes to cross 111th Street at 51st Avenue will have to wait until rush hour Wednesday afternoon before the traffic light timing glitch related to the new south LRT extension is fixed, the city of Edmonton said Tuesday.
During morning and evening rush hours, drivers have had to wait several traffic light changes before crossing 111th Street.
'We discovered the way traffic moves and the way the LRT trains arrive at an intersection, it's creating a perfect storm ... totally unacceptable,' said transportation general manager Bob Boutilier.
East-, west-, north- and southbound traffic all have a predetermined amount of time to get through the intersection. But every time the LRT approaches 51st Avenue, it takes priority, he said.
'If the train just happened to be arriving the same time your opportunity came up, after two or three of those, people were very upset and I can understand,' Boutilier said.
Transportation operations staff have been trying to properly co-ordinate traffic light changes with the LRT at the intersection since the problems began Monday, but they haven't yet had success.
'The crews did an adjustment this morning and there was some improvement, but it's not good enough,' Boutilier said.
Drivers should avoid the intersection for the next few days if they can, or take the LRT if it fits in with their commutes, he said.
The city plans to install an 'intelligent transportation system' by the end of the year that will ensure similar problems won't occur when the LRT is eventually extended throughout the city, Boutilier said. The system will determine traffic light changes based on traffic flow, he said.
'That system will determine what that actual traffic flow is. If there is a need to improve traffic flow east to west or north to south right now, all we can do is set the timing based on a normal day operation.'
While city staff's and councillors' telephones have been 'ringing off the hook' about 51st Avenue, all other intersections are working just fine, he added.
