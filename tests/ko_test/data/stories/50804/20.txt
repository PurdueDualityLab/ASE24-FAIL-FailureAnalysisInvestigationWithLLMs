LRT causes snarls
Startup glitches are to be expected with any complex new facility, and Edmonton's magnificent new ground-level LRT extension was never likely to be an exception. With bus routes and thousands of individual travel patterns changing, and with a new series of level crossings for car drivers to get used to, it would have been a miracle it this week's LRT opening south to Century Park had not put a few frowns on commuters' faces.
Nevertheless -- especially considering similar problems were experienced after last year's opening of the South Campus leg -- one wonders how on earth it was a surprise to city transportation officials that there could be trouble where the high-volume arterial 51st Avenue crossed the new line just west of the intersection with 111th Street.
After all, to be a success, the LRT needs to be something Edmontonians associate with words like 'helpful,' 'improvement' and 'faster commutes.' And to put it delicately, those weren't the words most commonly on the lips of drivers Monday and Tuesday as they waited up to 20 minutes watching the train barrier come down seemingly the moment the light turned green.
Indeed, as they fumed, many drivers must have been asking themselves what it is going to be like getting across the lights at 51st Avenue and other crossings if the LRT is sufficiently successful as to force Edmonton Transit to increase the frequency of trains.
Perhaps, by today, technical adjustments will be improving the situation, some drivers will have eased the pressure by avoiding the problem areas, and everyone will take the precaution of having a nice, calming cup of tea before setting out.
The future of LRT, and the willingness of Edmontonians to pay for a huge further expansion, depends on finding ways of making public transit work with private vehicle traffic, not against it, and making it easier and less stressful for everyone to get around their city.
