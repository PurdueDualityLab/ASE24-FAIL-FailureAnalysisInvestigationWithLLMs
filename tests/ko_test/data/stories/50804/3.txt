snarls traffic at busy LRT crossing; Bad timing creates 'perfect storm' for motorists, city official admits
EDMONTON - It was just after 5 p.m. when Travis Couturier pulled his red pickup into the turning lane at 51st Avenue and 111th Street. Staring at a bank of red traffic lights, he eased into neutral, lit a cigarette and settled back into the driver's seat.
Since the new Southgate LRT stop opened on the weekend, Couturier has been through this intersection a handful of times, never waiting for less than five minutes at the lights.
A timing glitch related to the LRT extension has backed the traffic here up during rush hours, forcing some drivers to wait up to 26 minutes through multiple light changes before making it through.
It's a problem the city says it hopes to have fixed in time for today's afternoon commute, but one that had the drivers lining up Tuesday behind Couturier increasingly antsy as the minutes ticked by.
After four minutes at the intersection, Couturier revved his engine, inched forward, then stopped. This light should have been his -- an advance green clearing his way onto 111th Street. But before the signal could change, a train arrived and the gates came down.
'The way traffic moves and the way the LRT trains arrive at an intersection, it's creating a perfect storm,' said the city's transportation general manager, Bob Boutilier.
East, west, north and southbound traffic all have a set amount of time to get through the intersection, Boutilier said. But every time the LRT approaches 51st Avenue, it takes priority.
As a result, some drivers are getting stuck over and over again. The trains keep coming before their lights have a chance to change.
'After two or three of those, people were very upset,' Boutilier said.
Transportation staff have been trying to co-ordinate the light changes with the LRT since the problems began Monday, but they haven't had much success. They did an adjustment Tuesday and Boutilier said there was some improvement, but not enough.
After waiting more than 11 minutes, Couturier's cigarette had burned down to a nub. Behind him the cars stretched more than a full city block and drivers had taken to yelling out their frustrations.
'This is ridiculous,' one woman said from inside a blue sedan.
'This is f---ing ridiculous,' a man said with a little more emphasis.
Boutilier said drivers should try to avoid the intersection for the next few days, or take the LRT if it fits their commutes.
The city plans to install an 'intelligent transportation system' by the end of the year that will ensure similar problems won't occur when the LRT is extended throughout the city.
While city staff and councillors' telephones have been 'ringing off the hook' about 51st Avenue, all other intersections are working just fine, he said.
Couturier finally made it through the intersection after more than 14 minutes at the light. Still, he thinks the delays are a reasonable, if annoying, price to pay for extending the train.
'I think they should have put it underground at these busy intersections,' he said. 'But I think it's worth it.'
