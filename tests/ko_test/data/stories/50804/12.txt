Traffic troubles continue on LRT route
Tuesday was another frusturating morning for motorists commuting near the new south LRT line. It's the second full operational day for the new stations, and while all is well for LRT passengers, it's a different story for drivers waiting at train crossings.
A glitch with the traffic lights at the intersection of 111th street and 51st avenue caused delays of six minutes or longer for drivers travelling east or west through the intersection.
At one point during the Tuesday morning commute, motorists travelling eastbound at the intersection waited 26 minutes before the light turned green in their direction. Drivers in the left hand turning lane were left with few options to cross the intersection and some attemped to drive over the curb to get out of the turning lane.
'It's awful,' One motorist told Global News on Tuesday, 'I actually watched cars going back, turning back because they couldn't wait. The cars going across 111th are not even going.'
City transportation staff have also been at the intersection since Monday working on the timing system for the traffic lights, but according to city officials there is still a lot of work to be done.
'It's a fairly complex system, putting all the different elements together' Dave Geake, the city's Director of LRT said on Tuesday, 'certainly along here there is more integration that we've tried to bring about with traffic operation and train operation, so it's been a challenge.'
Officials say they understand that the traffic tie-ups are frusturating, but are urging motorists to be patient. The best advice for drivers is to avoid the intersection completely until the situation is sorted out.
