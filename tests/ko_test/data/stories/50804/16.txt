Re: 'Provinces to get role in choosing Senate; Wildrose party calls for candidates in uncalled vote,' The Journal, April 28.
The idea of electing our senators sounds reasonable, as it should in a democracy. We might even get lucky and have a few quality people elected.
Even though we're trying to minimize political favouritism by not appointing senators, I have my doubts about leaving it to the general public to select qualified senators. It usually ends up being a politically popular person, perhaps without the qualities of a good senator.
Important posts which have a lot of authority, such as federal judges, do have some minimum requirements. What are the minimum standards for a senator?
Should education level, legislative experience, community involvement or project commitments be part of the criteria? Should a history of wise decision-making come into play? Could a relatively young person qualify? I'm sure there must be many factors that could be involved.
It's time the government set up an all-party committee to research and create a new Senate reform policy. Just sending in a name or two from provinces isn't going to cut it.
The Senate needs reform. We need to take a long, hard look at the Senate to see where it can be improved.

Re: 'Conflict leaves soccer board soaked in 'bad blood': Former members' attempt to oust president lands in court,' The Journal, April 30.
If the former board members of the Alberta Soccer Association were concerned about the state of the sport, they would set aside their battle for the control of Edmonton soccer at the provincial association.
They would accept, with dignity, the overwhelming judgment of the membership's special general meeting and stop spending the soccer kids' money on legal fees.
This fight has cost the soccer kids of Alberta upwards of $300,000 in the last three years and now they want to spend more.
Enough is enough; the membership has spoken.

Re: 'Taking responsibility,' by Art Tighe, Letters, April 27.
Tighe asks us what is wrong when a grown woman 'fights' a 14-year-old? I would suggest that this incident wasn't a fight, although blaming the victim is an old strategy for many who don't want to address issues of violence in society.
More disturbing is that Tighe shifts attention away from the real issue. In his view, women apparently should not be drunk, or for that matter, gallivanting about at 3:30 a.m. Tellingly, he does not show the slightest sign of condemnation for the outrageous violence that resulted from the confrontation.
And so I would suggest that, in pointing out the 'sins' of these women, yet omitting any mention of or response to the 'punishment' that was meted out upon them, Tighe is telling us that he does not disapprove of the violence that took place on that morning. Such complicit indifference to random acts of violence occurring in our city is completely wrong.

Re: 'LRT 'glitch' was avoidable,' Kelly Thierman, April 29.
Thierman seems to have his facts wrong. The traffic flow at the intersection at 51st Avenue and 111th Street was designed to be much smoother than it was; there was simply a glitch that didn't allow things to go well. It can happen with any large, complex project like an LRT expansion.
I'm not sure what rail systems he refers to, but any I have seen in my travels (Europe, New York, China, Australia) give trains the right of way because a subway/LRT system is designed to move people from cars to the train for more efficient and environmentally sustainable transportation. If the LRT had to stop for red lights like cars, it would defeat the goal of being an attractive alternative to cars.
I cross 34th/40th Avenue and 111th Street many times a day and those intersections are no worse than they were before the LRT.
People in this city need to give up their car-oriented ideals and look to the future.
