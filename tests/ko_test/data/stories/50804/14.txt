EDMONTON - Transportation operations staff are still working on properly co-ordinating traffic-light changes with the new south LRT extension at 51st Avenue and 111th Street.
Drivers on 51st Avenue have had to wait several traffic-light changes before crossing 111th Street, due to a timing glitch. Transportation staff have been at work at the intersection since the problems began during the morning rush hour on Monday, but still need to make major changes to the timing system, city spokesman Ben Mittelsteadt said.
"We've noted that further changes will be required. Staff are going to continue to actively monitor the signal timings and more significant timing changes will occur," Mittelsteadt said Tuesday morning.
Some drivers have attempted creative ways of getting around the intersection, but safety is the biggest concern, he said.
"We want to discourage any unsafe behaviour from motorists," Mittelsteadt said. "We understand it's frustrating, but we're working hard to correct the situation."
