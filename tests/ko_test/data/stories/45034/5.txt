Airboat operators target Lake Toho night ban

Jun. 8--KISSIMMEE
As Florida airboaters crank up fundraising to fight a nighttime ban they say essentially ends chances of successfully hunting alligators on Lake Tohopekaliga, state game officials have issued six more supplemental permits for taking alligators on the lake this season.
A computer glitch at third-party vendor Outdoor Central of Missouri on the opening day of alligator permit sales last week, caused by the high demand of applications being processed at the same time, resulted in a failure to handle many applications.
While June 10 is the typical cutoff date for sales of the 4,800 available permits, at least 369 more will be available statewide starting at 10 a.m. June 17, including the six for Lake Toho as well as 35 for the Kissimmee River and four for Lake Kissimmee.
However, hunters such as Capt. Phil Walters of Tampa, owner of Gatorguides.com, aren't too excited about the prospects on Lake Toho despite increasing numbers of gators on the lake in recent years. They say a ban on night operation of airboats effective in April on East Lake Toho and Lake Toho, passed by the Osceola County Commission, will reduce their chances of a successful hunt, regardless of permits.
Walters plans to hunt on Lake Jesup and other areas drawn by his clients, but he doesn't see much point in coming to Toho, he said last week.
"You just aren't going to have much luck during the day," he said, although he would like to see a change in Florida's law to allow daytime hunting of gators. Currently in Florida, unlike some places, gators may not be hunted during the day at all.
When searching for alligators, hunters prefer using airboats to get into marshy areas where the reptiles usually stay.
The Florida Airboat Association, meanwhile, is raising money to back a lawsuit. Airboaters say they fear if they lose night boating on Lake Toho now, it will be other lakes later.
"We have consulted with legal counsel and intend to bring legal action against Osceola County over the issue of access to this lake for everyone, including gator hunters. We want to save our rights before the attack becomes more invasive -- in Osceola County or elsewhere," said a message to members from Bishop Wright Jr., president of the airboat association.
Osceola County officials repeatedly have said they value gator hunting and the service hunters do by keeping lakes safer, and they do not intend to stop or hinder the hunting.
Commissioners saw a video from a resident taken in the middle of the night near his home, and the sounds of airboats sounded not unlike helicopters overhead. Residents had complained of sleep deprivation night after night during gator season. After seeing the video, commissioners voted unanimously for the night ban on those lakes.
Hunting is still allowed at all hours on the lake, although it must be from other types of craft, commissioners said. The ban is aimed at reducing noise on lakes where homes have been built nearby in recent years and is aimed only at airboats, not the practice of hunting.
