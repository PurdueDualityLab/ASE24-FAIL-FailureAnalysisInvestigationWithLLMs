The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is opening a supplemental sales period for alligator harvest permits because of a glitch in the licensing system.
All available permits will go on sale at 10 a.m. June 17 on a first-come, first-serve basis. To check the status of any permit requests, log on to MyFWC.com/gators - then click the link, "Check Your Alligator Harvest Permit Status." You can check the number of permits still available by clicking the link, "Check Alligator Harvest Permit Availability."
Only one permit will be allowed during the supplemental period. Permits will be distributed June 24.
GULF RULES NOW IN EFFECT
First Coast anglers who spend time in the Gulf of Mexico, remember that new reef fish rules took effect June 1. Vessels must use circle hooks, venting tools and dehooking devices. The new rules apply in federal waters.
GREGARIOUS BEAR BAGGED
The black bear that was frequenting Universal Studios in Orlando recently was caught by FWC officers May 31 in a nearby neighborhood. It was taken to the Ocala National Forest and released.
