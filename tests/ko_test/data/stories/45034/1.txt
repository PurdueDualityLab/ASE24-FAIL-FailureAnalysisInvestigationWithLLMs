TALLAHASSEE, Fla., June 5 -- The Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission issued the following news release:
The Florida Fish andWildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) will hold a supplemental sales period for people who failed to get an alligator hunt permit or those who would like to return a permit with the hope of trying to obtain another.
This additional sales period will help reduce any inconveniences caused by a computer programming glitch during the initial sales period on Tuesday, June 3.
At 10 that morning,approximately 4,800 alligator hunt permits went on sale on a first-come, first-served basis. Shortly after the start time, the licensing system operated by a third-party vendor, Outdoor Central of Jefferson City, Mo., experienced problems handling the high volume of applications. For some applicants, the system either failed to process the permit requests or failed to provide electronic confirmation to those who were successful at obtaining a permit. This computer glitch resulted in confusion and frustration for many applicants as they tried to buy permits. Persons who are unsure of whether they have been awarded a permit should check their status online by going to MyFWC.com/gators and clicking on "Check Your Alligator Harvest Permit Status."
A limited set of permitswill go on sale starting at 10 a.m. (EDT) Tuesday, June 17 on a first-come, first-served basis through the Total Licensing System. Outdoor Central's management team identified and corrected the glitch in its system, and the next day the FWC held a successful first-come, first-served hunt process with no troubles.
A listing of the minimumnumber of permits that will be available during this supplemental sales period, along with instructions on how to return unwanted permits and more details about this opportunity, will be posted on the FWC's Alligator Management Web site at MyFWC.com/gators. The deadline to purchase a permit during this supplemental sales period is 11:59 p.m. (EDT) June 23.
During this supplementalsales period, people will be allowed to purchase only one permit, enabling them to take two alligators. Anyone who has already been awarded a permit will not be allowed to apply during the supplemental sales period, unless they have already contacted the FWC to return the previously awarded permit. Persons who applied on June 3 and wish to apply during the supplemental sales period are encouraged to check their permit status to ensure they do not have a valid permit.
The date when customerscan purchase additional permits, if any are available after the initial and supplemental sales periods, has been postponed from June 10 to June 24 at 10 a.m. (EDT). People can apply for a permit at any county tax collector's office, any retail outlet that sells hunting licenses or on the Internet at www.wildlifelicense.com[http://www.wildlifelicense.com].
People can check theavailability of permits during any sales period, in real time, by going to MyFWC.com/gators and clicking "Check Alligator Harvest Permit availability."
