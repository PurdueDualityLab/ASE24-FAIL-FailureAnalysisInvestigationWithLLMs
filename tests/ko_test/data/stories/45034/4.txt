TALLAHASSEE, Fla., June 3 -- The Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission issued the following news release:
Within the first sixhours, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) sold 4,555 alligator hunt permits, despite a computer programming glitch.
The licensing system,operated by a third-party vendor, Outdoor Central in Jefferson City, Mo., experienced problems handling the high volume of applications and failed to provide confirmation to customers when they tried to purchase a license and permit. This resulted in some people being unable to successfully purchase a license and permit generating confusion and frustration for many applicants.
"This is not the firsttime we have had issues with this vendor," said Rodney Barreto, FWC Commission chairman. "This is totally unacceptable, and I am asking agency staff to look into all options for recourse and remedy, including possible termination of the vendor's contract and seeking a new vendor.
"In addition, I am askingstaff to identify options for making this right for people who encountered problems with the system and were unable to purchase a permit."
As of 4 p.m. Tuesday,fewer than 200 permits remained and are still available for issuance. The deadline to purchase a permit is 11:59 p.m. (EDT) on June 9.
Approximately 4,800alligator hunt permits went on sale at 10 a.m. on a first-come, first-served basis. During this initial sales period, people are allowed to purchase only one permit per person, enabling them to take two alligators.
People can check theavailability of permits, in real time, by going to MyFWC.com/gators and clicking "Check for Available Permits."
The alligator hunting season runs Aug. 15 - Nov. 1.
