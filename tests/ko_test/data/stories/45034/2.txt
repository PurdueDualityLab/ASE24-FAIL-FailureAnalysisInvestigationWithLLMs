The Florida Fish andWildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) announced Thursday it will offer "at least" 369 more alligator hunting permits in a special supplemental sales period June 17. The sales period is targeted toward people who failed to get one after 4,800 permits went on sale Tuesday.
The sale also will enable those who obtained a permit to return it and obtain another.
This additional sales period was added to defray the frustration cause by a computer programming glitchthat occurred during the initial sales period Tuesday. The licensing system operated by a third-party vendor, Outdoor Central of Jefferson City, Mo., experienced problems handling the high volume of applications. For some applicants, the system either failed to process the permit requests or failed to provide electronic confirmation to those who were successful at obtaining a permit.
Additional permits wereallocated based on areas that sold out quickly and permits that did not sell as of Thursday, said Steve Stiegler, FWC alligator harvest coordinator. Each permit allows the harvest of two alligators. Additional permits mean that slightly more than 10,000 alligators could be harvested by hunters during the state's 2008 alligator hunt season Aug. 15-Nov. 1.
"The hunt usuallyaverages a tag fill rate of about 70 percent," Stiegler said. "So about 7,000 alligators will potentially be harvested this year."
The date when customerscan purchase additional permits, if any are available after the initial and supplemental sales periods, has been postponed from June 10 to June 24 at 10 a.m. People can apply for a permit at any county tax collector's office, any retail outlet that sells hunting licenses or on the Internet at www.wildlifelicense.com[http://www.wildlifelicense.com].
The cost for a residentalligator trapping license and hide-validation tag is $271.50, and non-residents pay $1,021.50. The cost for each additional alligator hunting permit is $61.50 regardless of residency. All fees are nonrefundable.
An alligator trappingagent license is also available for $51.50, enabling the license holder to assist a trapper in taking alligators, but only in the presence of the permitted trapper. All permit holders must be at least 18 years of age by Aug. 15.
