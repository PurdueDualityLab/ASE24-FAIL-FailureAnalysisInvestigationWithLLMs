TURKISH-SYRIAN BORDER -- Turkey said it would start bypassing Syria to ship goods to the Middle East via Iraq and the Mediterranean Sea, in response to a Syrian blockade that has left hundreds of Turkish vehicles stranded at the border.
The escalating dispute came as relations between the two neighbors plumbed new depths. Syria's state news organs accused Turkey of preparing a Western invasion and of harboring insurgents who staged an attack across the border.
Ankara will begin on Thursday to truck goods across Iraq and ship them by sea from the southern port of Mersin to Alexandria, Egypt, avoiding Syria, Economy Minister Zafer Caglayan told Turkey's CNBC-e television channel.
Ankara's shift was forced by Syria's decision to block traffic at Turkey's borders, Mr. Caglayan said on Wednesday. He said the blockade, in turn, was retaliation for Turkey's decision last week to impose sanctions against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, but that the blockade punished mainly the Syrian people.
"It is very easy for us to bypass Syria but we preferred not to do this," said Mr. Caglayan. "But they wanted it this way. I say again, whatever they do they will suffer more than Turkey every time. To trade with the Middle East and the Gulf we do not have to go through Syria. Our A, B and C plans are already ready."
Ankara and Damascus were close regional allies until this summer, when Turkish officials said Mr. Assad's refusal to end a bloody crackdown against opponents forced a shift. Ankara last week joined the Arab League in imposing sanctions on regime officials, but it is neighboring Turkey that has borne the brunt of anger in Damascus.
Mr. Caglayan's announcement came a day after Syria's SANA state news agency reported that 35 "terrorists" had crossed the border from Turkey and were driven back in a gunfight, with several wounded taken away in Turkish military vehicles.
A spokesman for Turkey's foreign ministry on Tuesday said Ankara doesn't send "armed persons to any other country."
On Wednesday, the Free Syrian Army, an opposition group whose leadership is based in Turkey, confirmed that one of its units did stage an attack on a Syrian police station close to the border and that wounded rebels had crossed the border to seek treatment, Reuters reported.
However, the spokesman said the unit wasn't from Turkey, but rather was based inside Syria.
One soldier from the dissident force said Syria's military on Wednesday moved into several towns in Idlib province, near the Turkish border, including Kafr Nabl and Saraqeb, with some troops riding on tanks painted blue.
Syrian activists have reported seeing blue tanks around the city of Homs over the past month, in what they describe as a government attempt to appear to pull military deployments from its cities, as part of a November agreement with the Arab League.
As fighting broke out between the military and defected soldiers from the Free Syrian Army in the Idlib towns, dozens of new soldiers defected and joined the fight, said the dissident soldier, who was briefed on the fighting. There was no immediate report of casualties from the dissident army or from Syria's government.
In further signs of Syrian anger, the state-run Tishreen newspaper on Tuesday ran an op-ed article that said: "Turkey today is ruled by Jews. . . . Its foreign minister, [Ahmet] Davutoglu, and those walking his walk are all related."
Mr. Davutoglu is Muslim and Turkey recently has taken a tough line against Israel. The article called that stance a sham.
In another article, the paper alleged that Turkey was preparing the way for Syria's invasion by France and the U.S.
Ankara has said it may have to impose a buffer zone inside Syria if the country destabilizes.
At the main Bab al-Hawa border crossing between Syria and Turkey on Wednesday, drivers complained they had been held up for days since Syrian customs officials stopped allowing Turkish vehicles into Syria.
"They're only allowing in Syrian drivers and goods from Europe, no Turkish origin goods," said Mehmet Kurtoglu, who had spent three days waiting.
Some 400 to 500 trucks were stranded on the Syrian side of the no man's land between the two border posts, some with perishable fruit, vegetables and meat, according to drivers entering from the Turkish side. A Turkish official wouldn't allow a reporter to cross into the no man's land.
Syrian officials had said the shutdown was due to a computer glitch. Turkish drivers weren't buying it. They complained, too, of new customs duties and fuel surcharges that were making their deliveries unprofitable. "The bribes have doubled, too," said Mr. Kurtoglu, who said he had been a driver for 30 years.
Mr. Caglayan said Wednesday that as soon as Turkey made it clear it would begin bypassing Syria, Syrian customs officials had begun letting trucks through again. On Wednesday morning, truckers said the Syrians had begun to let transit vehicles through, but not Turkish traders bound for Syria.
Trade between the two countries has slowed significantly over the past few months, according to drivers and the Turkish-Syrian Business Association. Turkish -- but not Syrian -- drivers also complained that the roads were no longer safe.
Mitar, a 37-year-old driver who declined to give his surname, said he was in a convoy that was caught in crossfire outside the Syrian city of Hama. He said the convoy had parked in parallel lines, and that he and the other truck drivers crouched between them for protection.
Fifty-five-year-old Ahmet Yeter said he lost the sight in one eye after being beaten by Syrian troops on his way to Tarsus. He was staffing a tea concession for waiting drivers.
