BANGKOK, May 27 (Reuter) - Thai stocks are seen falling on Tuesday as worries surrounding Monday's market closure, finance sector woes and economic concerns could fuel further sales by foreign investors, analysts said.
Authorities blamed a technical problem for Monday's abbreviated trading session in which the SET Index closed 12.77 points lower at 568.36. The SET 50 lost 1.35 points to 41.14.
"I don't think we can expect a good day today, there will be a lot of selling pressure. I heard that sell orders were lining up at the moment," said Nimit Wongjariakul, senior vice president at Thaimex Finance and Securities Plc.
Monday's computer glitch was regarded suspiciously by some brokers who believed the interuption may have been politically motivated despite the exchange's denial.
"The market has been squeezed down to institutional players and they don't like the idea that big brother could be muscling in on everything," Nimit said.
Interest rate cuts engineered by the Bank of Thailand are not sufficient to produce an easier monetary environment, analysts said. Concerns about finance sector merger problems may also weigh on sentiment after the abortive Thai Danu Bank Plc and Finance One Plc merger plan, analysts said.
Thai Danu shares resumed trading after being suspended since February 28 at 46 baht. Early bids were placed at around 38 baht.
