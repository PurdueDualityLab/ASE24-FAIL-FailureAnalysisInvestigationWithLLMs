The Security Exchange of Thailand (SET) had to stop trading after an extensive computer glitch hit its communication hardware in May 26, 1997. Investors were expected to sell their stock of debt-troubled Finance One PCL, following the collapse of merger talks between the countryEs largest finance company and Thai Danu Bank PCL, during the trading day. Moreover, speculators were also curious whether the Bank of Thailand would alter its interest-rate policy. Technical difficulties occurred just three minutes after the start of the trading day, with benchmark SET index down 9.02 points at 572.11. The market closed the trading day 12.77 points down at 568.36.
