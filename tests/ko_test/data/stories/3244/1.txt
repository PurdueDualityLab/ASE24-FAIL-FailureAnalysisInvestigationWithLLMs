BANGKOK (Dow Jones)--It was touted as a day of reckoning for Thailand's financial markets, but it almost didn't happen.
Chilled by the collapse of takeover talks between Thai Danu Bank PCL (P.TDB) and debt-laden Finance One PCL (H.FIO) late last week, stock pickers were expected to flee the market Monday. Dealers pointed to the uncertain fate of 'FIN1' - Thailand's largest finance company - as cause for alarm.
Punters were also anxious to see what the Bank of Thailand, tipped to cut interest rates at the weekend, would actually do.
But judgment was stalled when a massive computer glitch wiped out the bulk of Monday's trading at the Stock Exchange of Thailand, known as SET.
'The timing was curious, but these things occasionally happen at the SET,' one foreign broker said.
The exchange's communications hardware seized up just three minutes into the day's trading with the benchmark Stock Exchange of Thailand, or SET, Index 9.02 points down at 572.11. With brokers about to give up after a series of false starts, the market squeezed in half an hour of trading with the help of an extra 15 minutes tagged on the end of usual closing time. Just enough time, observers said, for support funds to move into action and stave off heavy declines. The SET Index finished the day 12.77 points down at 568.36.
But despite support buying, fueled by a 50 billion-baht fund set up by the Thai Bankers Association last week, the underlying uncertainty surrounding Finance One was enough to bring the market down. The finance company now has to treble its capital by order of central bank and sell each new share at 7.50 baht, below the 10 baht par value.
Whether there will be any takers remains to be seen.
