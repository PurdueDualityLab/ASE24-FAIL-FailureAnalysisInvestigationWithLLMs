Computer Problems Stall SET Trading

BANGKOK -- It was touted as a day of reckoning for Thailand's financial markets, but it turned out to be more of a day of waiting around.
Chilled by the collapse of takeover talks between Thai Danu Bank PCL and debt-laden Finance One PCL late last week, stock pickers were expected to flee the market Monday. Dealers pointed to the uncertain fate of Finance One -- Thailand's largest finance company -- as cause for alarm. Punters were also anxious to see if the Bank of Thailand would change its interest-rate policy.
But judgment was stalled when a massive computer glitch wiped out the bulk of Monday's trading at the Stock Exchange of Thailand. "The timing was curious, but these things occasionally happen at the SET," one foreign broker said.
The exchange's communications hardware seized up just three minutes into the day's trading, with the benchmark SET Index down 9.02 points at 572.11. With brokers about to give up after a series of false starts, the market squeezed in half an hour of trading with the help of an extra 15 minutes tagged on after the usual closing time. Just enough time, observers said, for support funds to move into action and stave off heavy declines. The SET Index finished the day 12.77 points down at 568.36.
But despite support buying, fueled by a 50 billion baht ($1.96 billion) fund set up by the Thai Bankers Association last week, the underlying uncertainty surrounding Finance One was enough to bring the market down. The finance company now has to treble its capital by order of the central bank, and sell each new share at 7.50 baht, below the 10 baht par value.
Whether there will be any takers remains to be seen. "For those people who had bought up the market from 550 to 600 points, it certainly would be sensible for them to realize some gains," said Song Seng Wun, a regional economist at ABN Amro Hoare Govett in Singapore. "And given that everybody is still nervous about the collapse of the Finance One deal, it may precipitate further as selling pressure remains."
SET officials were at pains to stress the computer foul-up had nothing to do with the collapse of the Finance One deal. Some brokers were skeptical though, noting that when the Finance One-Thai Danu merger was first announced back in early March, the exchange took the unprecedented step of suspending all trading in the finance and securities sector. But others said that milder computer problems hampered trading on Friday.
