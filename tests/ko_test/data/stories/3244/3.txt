BANGKOK, May 26 (Reuter) - Brokers in Thailand took a grim view of an official shutdown of the local share market on Monday, many fearing it could further damage the market's troubled image as prices continue to slide.
The market's bellwether SET Index initially opened 1.55 percent down before trading abruptly ground to a halt after the first three minutes. The blue chip SET 50 was down 2.31 percent.
The authorities, blaming a computer glitch, said the market would reopen an hour and forty five minutes later at 0445 GMT, but that reopening was delayed until the afternoon session.
When trading finally resumed, orders failed to go through. The exchange said it would try again later in the afternoon for a curtailed session.
As trading re-opened around 0915 GMT, the SET Index plunged 4.98 percent on heavy turnover, driven primarily by foreign investors.
A support fund, set up by local banks, helped the market pare losses near the close, leaving the SET down 2.20 percent, or 12.77 points, at 568.36 on the day.
Some brokers speculated that an unseen hand may have been behind the computer fault on a day when the market was expected to tumble.
The computer crash followed Friday's news that a much-touted mega-merger between Thai Danu Bank Plc and Finance One Plc had failed. That news was expected to propel the market lower on Monday.
Local brokers said the breakdown of the computerised and normally efficient Thai market trading system for such a lengthy period of time was unprecedented.
"It makes Thailand look even worse," said a trader at a major regional brokerage.
"This is the worst thing you can do -- stop a bear market in a downturn," he added. "It's more bad news...a combination of many things over the last few years would lead someone to have very strong suspicions about this closure."
The Thai bourse is one of the world's worst performing exchanges over the last year following a slew of negative economic news.
"I think people are very disappointed. You could say people think this is the second time the exchange has been halted this year...and now maybe they think this is the best way," said Tanawat Patchimkul, an analyst at Seamico Securities Plc.
The Stock Exchange of Thailand halted trade in finance and bank stocks on March 3 this year while announcing measures to shore up the troubled sector.
An exchange spokesman said the computer system was having problems on Monday matching sell and buy orders.
"I don't think it is possible that the market was ordered to close by anyone. The SET president, and under exceptional circumstances I think the finance minister, have the authority to do this. But why would they? We have been through situations like this before so there are no fundamental reasons for doing so," he said.
The spokesman denied the speculation that the SET intentionally halted trading due to fears about the adverse impact of the failed merger between Thai Danu and Finance One.
"We really did not want this situation to happen. It's not good for the exchange," he said.
