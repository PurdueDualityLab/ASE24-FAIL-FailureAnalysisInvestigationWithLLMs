Thailand stock fall after day of "gremlins" on bourse
BANGKOK, May 27 (AFP) - Shares on Thailand's stock exchange opened lower Tuesday, a day after the bourse was shut by an apparent computer glitch amid market fears of a plunge in the financial sector, officials said.
The Stock Exchange of Thailand's SET index was off 4.73 points at 563.66 in midmorning trade, off an early low of 562.81.
Authorities closed the market after just three minutes of trading Monday before reopening the bourse for just half an hour at the end of the day, blaming computer problems.
Monday was the first trading day since the announcement that a much vaunted merger between a respected bank, Thai Danu, and the country's largest but debt-ridden finance firm, Finance One, had fallen through.
But a stock exchange official Tuesday denied rumours that the breakdown, which prevented calculation of the index, had been deliberate to avoid a meltdown in financial stocks.
"The breakdown was a computer problem and had nothing to do with the scrapping of the Finance One-Thai Danu deal," a spokeman told AFP Tuesday.
Stock Exchange of Thailand executive vice president, Surat Palalikit, also dismissed suggestions that the exchange ceased operations at the behest of the government.
In a Bangkok Post report, Surat said the stock exchange's hardware, which links the trading system with the systems of member brokerages, "had simply failed."
