Cebu City was the fastest among four cities in the country to electronically send vote results to Manila in yesterday's mock polls.
There was no major glitch with the machines or Precinct Count Optical Scanners (PCOS), said Cebu City Election Officer Marchel Sarno, but he emphasized that massive voter's education is still needed to make ordinary voters familiar with the new steps.
Some elderly voters, who had trouble shading the ovals in the ballot, found their ballots rejected by the machine on the first attempt.
Voting by a batch of 50 people each was finished in test barangays of Bulacao and Mabini by about 9 a.m.
Data was received at the canvassing area at 9:11 am for Bulacao and 9:48 a.m. For Mabini, a mountain barangay.
The consolidation report was done at 9:50 a.m. and sent to the Comelec Manila office at exactly 10 a.m. Manila confirmed receiving it five minutes later.
Gregorio Larrazabal, Comelec commissioner and steering committee head for automation, arrived past 9 a.m. to observe the exercise in Cebu City.
He said he was satisfied that the process went smoothly with no problem met during the canvassing.
The other cities where mock polls were conducted were Taguig in Metro Manila, Davao and Baguio.
It was “very impressive, it was successful. So far we haven't seen problems. Everything was under control, but when it comes to machines, it is already beyond our control,” said Veronica Petalcorin, assistant Comelec regional director, who observed and assisted the canvassing.
The four-hour exercises tested balloting to transmission of results to a board of can vassers at the Legislative Building of Cebu City Hall.
Some minor glitches were noted.
Flashing cameras of TV crews and journalists covering the event may have affected transmission signals in the mountain barangay of Mabini.
Due to fluctuating signals of the mobile phone network, poll officials in barangay Mabini had to switch to satellite antennae of Smartmatic's broadband global area network (BGAN).
The unsteady signal delayed the sending of vote results to the Cebu City board of canvassers. The actual voting in Mabini was finished at 9 a.m., but the result was transmitted only at 9:58 a.m.
With this, Cebu Provincial Election Supervisor Lionel Marco Castillano, who was supervising the exercise in Mabini Elementary School, said he will recommend to the Comelec central office that no video footage be taken in the polling area until vote results are finished, at least in remote areas.
Gaps in voters' education, especially for the elderly, was also noted.
He said a 70-year-old voter failed to fully shade the ovals in the ballot corresponding to his choice candidates.
The ballot was rejected when it was fed into the PCOS. On the second try, after the voter fully shaded the circles, the machine accepted the ballot.
Castillano said older voters who have difficulty with their vision should bring eyeclasses.
Or they could be considered a disability and allowed to be assisted by a relative.
Castillano confirmed that Cebu was the first one again to transmit the result to the Comelec central office. When the field test was done a few weeks ago in two areas in Naga city, Cebu was the first to transmit its result.
