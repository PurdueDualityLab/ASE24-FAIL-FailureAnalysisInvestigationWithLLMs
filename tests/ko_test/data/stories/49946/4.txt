MANILA, Philippines—The Alliance of Concerned Teachers called on the Commission on Elections (Comelec) to provide teachers serving in the May 10 elections with training in the use of automated counting machines at the actual precinct sites where they would be deployed.
“Hands-on, on-site training is crucial. It's the only way to know if the wireless transmission of election results will work or not at a particular location. This will give teachers the chance to prepare for contingencies before election day,” ACT chair Antonio Tinio said in statement.
Tinio cited the “glitch-riddled field testing” of the voting machines held at the Aguho Elementary School in Pateros on Friday as an example of what to expect on election day should the Comelec fail to provide teachers with on-site training.
“The wireless transmission of votes from the precinct to servers at the municipal and national levels is the most challenging procedure from the point of view of the teachers who will operate the machines,” Tinio said.
“As we saw, it took the Smartmatic technicians over three hours to get the machine to transmit from the school in Pateros. If these experts had a hard time, what more the teachers?” he added.
