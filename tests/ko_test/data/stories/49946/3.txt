Glitches hit Manila's electronic voting plan; Poll watchdog stands by new system amid calls for manual count

Problems have beset the project since July, when the 7.2 billion peso (S $220 million) contract was awarded to Venezuelan company Smartmatic, to supply 82,200 optical-scan voting machines.
Already, some prominent politicians and interest groups are calling on the election authorities to switch back to counting votes the old-fashioned way rather than put the May 10 polls in jeopardy.
They include the head of the influential Makati Business Club, which represents local big business, and senior members of the Catholic Church in this Christian-majority country.
But public sentiment is firmly behind modernising elections, and voters hope the new system will reduce poll fraud and deliver a speedy count.
It takes several weeks to count votes by hand, an unnerving period when ballots are vulnerable to tampering while being transported to counting centres and during the tally itself.
Accusations of cheating are a fixture of the Philippines' boisterous polls. The last general election in 2004 is mainly remembered for the allegations that votes were rigged for President Gloria Arroyo to win.
'It's high time the Philippines holds automated elections and this may reduce cheating, though we'll have to wait and see if it does,' said Ms Elena Torijos, a Filipino freelance writer living in Singapore.
Plans are under way for Filipinos in Singapore and Hong Kong to use the system.
The machines scan hand-marked ballots and relay the results to a central server via mobile-phone networks. But test runs last month uncovered transmission problems because of weak signals, as well as problems reading filled-in ballots.
Smartmatic executives say the hitches can be fixed in time for the polls. Comelec, the country's election commission, is also upbeat about the new system working and has criticised the 'negative atmosphere' and 'apocalyptic predictions' of opponents.
Over the past weeks, Comelec officials have appeared in public forums and before Congress to allay concerns including the possibility that voting machines can be hacked into, and the logistical challenge of getting the right machines to 77,000 polling centres.
Fears of high-tech sabotage intensified after Comelec said a shipment of 5,000 mobile-phone jamming devices had recently entered the Philippines.
'We cannot help but be suspicious,' a spokesman told reporters. 'Certain people are afraid of the change that automation will bring.'
The poll body has readied a back-up plan for manual voting in case some areas are unable to use the voting machines.
Fifty million voters are set to elect a new president and nearly 18,000 local and national government officials.
The authorities, meanwhile, are considering holding early elections if needed in parts of the country blighted by violence in past polls. These include the autonomous Muslim region on Mindanao island and northern provinces notorious for their warlords.
The move would allow the police and military to deploy more forces to these areas during the polling.
