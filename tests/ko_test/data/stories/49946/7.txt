Jan. 27--The Senate Committee on Codes and Laws approved on Tuesday the bill allowing early voting "to ease congestion of polling stations and increase participation on election day.
Meanwhile, the Commission on Elections (Comelec) did not discount the possibility that the May 2010 elections will be conducted manually.
Sen. Francis Escudero, the committee chairman, said that early voting would also allow the Comelec to concentrate its resources in critical areas.
He added that basically, areas with problems of peace and order or with history of fraud would be voting between 10 to 14 days before May 10, 2010. The Comelec will identify these areas.
The poll body had declared the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, Masbate, Abra and Nueva Ecija as election "hot spots" because of their history of violence during an election period.
Sen. Richard Gordon, the principal author of the early voting bill, said the measure would benefit people who are normally out of polling places on election day like poll workers, the elderly and people with medical problems.
Escudero is hopeful that the measure could still become a law even if there are only four session days left and provided that Malacanang certifies it as urgent.
Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel Zubiri had said that measures not contained in a committee report as of last week could no longer become laws "unless they are certified by Malacanang."
Certification by Malacanang exempts a bill from the three-day rule before it could undergo third reading. A bill is normally voted upon on third reading three days after its printed copy as approved on second reading is distributed to the senators.
Escudero said that with automated elections, votes cast by early voters would immediately be counted and canvassed.
Manual system
Comelec Chairman Jose Melo also on Tuesday said that failure of the field testing of the Precinct Count Optical Scan (PCOS) machines might result in the adoption of manual elections in May 2010.
The testing of the machines will begin on Wednesday, or two days after laboratory testing was completed.
"Kapag all-go doon [If it's all go in the field testing], then, it's also all go for automation. Otherwise, we have our contingency plan for manual [elections]," Melo told reporters.
"It would be easy," he said in Filipino, referring to the idea of going back to the manual system.
Also, the poll body chief said that the Comelec was awaiting certification of the source code that will be used to program the election machines.
A Colorado-based company, SysTest Labs, is scheduled to deliver the results of the certification on February 1.
A source code is a series of numbers that will be installed in the PCOS machines.
"By February 2 or 3, we will meet with the SysTest people. Then we will talk with those who would like to review the source code, so that we can agree on the ground rules on what can be done," Melo said.
Open to the public
The poll body chief added that the source-code review would be open to all interested parties, including political parties and citizens' groups, after the certification from SysTest arrives.
By February 4, Melo said that the source code would be embedded in the machines.
"That would mean it's all go [for the automation system]," the poll chief added in Filipino.
"All we would be needing now is the final field test, then the certification from SysTest, then the review and finally, the certification of acceptance by the Technical Evaluation Committee."
He said that he was expecting the field testing and the source-code certification to be finished by February 10, which will also be the date the poll body will decide whether to push through with the automation of the 2010 polls.
"The field testing is basically the same as the lab tests, but it will be in the field," Comelec Commissioner Gregorio Larrazabal said.
Larrazabal, who heads the Comelec Steering Committee, added that if the field testing on Wednesdays failed, the poll body and the joint venture of Smartmatic and Total Information Management would conduct another field testing on Friday.
The commissioner said that the laboratory tests conducted last week went well enough, except for some glitches encountered during the transmission process.
"When we inserted the SIM [subscriber identity module] card of one company, it didn't work. But when we replaced it with another SIM card of [another] company, the transmission was made," Larrazabal explained. He refused to name the telecommunication company that owns the SIM cards.
Larrazabal said that the poll body would be providing backup SIM cards during election day to prevent incidences of transmission hitches.
"Those are the things that we are looking into. To ensure all areas are covered, we have back-up plans," he added.
