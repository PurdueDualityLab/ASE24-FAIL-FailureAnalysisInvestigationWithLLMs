Major failures with a 4 million NHS computer system led to operations being cancelled, appointments being lost and letters being sent out for clinics that did not exist.
The Bristol hospital trust affected has called for an independent inquiry into the failed project.
The IT director at North Bristol NHS Trust (NBT) said that if he had foreseen the problems caused by moving to the electronic records system he would not have let it proceed.
The chairman of the hospital trust said in a meeting of its board that the Cerner Millennium system was 'not fit for purpose'.
The trust, which runs Frenchay and Southmead hospitals made the call after dozens of patients were affected by the bungled move to electronic records. Since the programme was launched at the hospital trust in mid December, consultants have been forced to send patients away without surgery because their notes were not available and turned away people who had turned up for outpatient appointments that had not been recorded on the new system.
Chief executive Ruth Brunt said those affected would be compensated. Letters have gone out to GPs to explain the issues and provide them with a hotline to contact about appointments. The system was launched after more than a year of preparation and staff training. Director of IT at the trust, Martin Bell told of glitches when the transfer to the new system was first carried out but said that issues with outpatients' letters and problems with medical notes became apparent afterwards. He could not say how many letters had gone out in error or how many operations had been cancelled as a result of issues with the computer system.
The trust said it was not aware of any patients being harmed as a result of the move.
One woman in her 50s, who did not wish to be named, said that she had become anxious waiting for a cardiac appointment that had taken six weeks to come through.
She said her father, who is also being treated at the trust for several different medical problems had had his details written on various different cards because the medical records were not available. NBT said it was sure the issue was not with the Cerner system itself but issues that had occurred in its implementation. Chairman of NBT, Peter Rilett, said: 'Quite why we were trying to launch something that was not fit for purpose when we went through all the simulations we could do, will be a matter for pretty urgent review.'
Chief executive Ruth Brunt said: 'We recognise this has been a very poor experience for some of our patients.'
77% Of clinics the trust says will run on the system by February 13
