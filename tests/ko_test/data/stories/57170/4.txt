HUNDREDS of patients have had operations cancelled or given appointments for clinics that did not exist due to failures with a new Pounds 3.9 million hospital computer system. Managers have called for an independent review of the chaos that has affected Southmead and Frenchay hospitals.
The IT director at North Bristol NHS Trust, which runs both hospitals, told the Evening Post that if he had foreseen the problems caused by the move to the electronic records system he would not have let it go through, while the chairman of the hospital trust has said that the Cerner Millennium system was "not fit for purpose".
The scale of the problems caused by the move to electronic records was laid bare at a meeting of the trust board yesterday.
Since the programme was launched at the hospital trust in mid December, consultants have been forced to send patients away without surgery because their notes were not available and turned away people who had turned up for outpatient appointments that had not been recorded on the new system, which is intended to cope with about 30,000 outpatient appointments per month. Chief executive Ruth Brunt said those affected would be compensated. Letters have gone out to GPs to explain the issues and provide them with a hotline to contact about appointments. The computer system was launched after more than a year of preparation and staff training. Director of IT at the trust Martin Bell told the Post of glitches when the transfer to the new system was first carried out but said that issues with outpatients' letters and problems with medical notes became apparent afterwards. He could not tell the Post how many letters had gone out in error or how many operations had been cancelled because issues with the computer system made the figures impossible to retrieve. The trust says it is not aware of any patients being harmed as a result of the move to the new system, designed to replace all paper notes and files, and stressed that clinical safety was always a priority.
One woman in her 50s, who did not wish to be named, said that she had become anxious waiting for a cardiac appointment that had taken more than six weeks to come through. She said her father, who is also being treated at the trust for several different medical problems, had had his details written on various different cards because the computer medical records were not available. As well as affecting patients and clinical staff the move to the new computer system has meant the trust has not been able to compile all the information it usually does on performance within its hospitals. Mr Bell said that in A&E, the 65 wards and the minor injuries units at Southmead and Yate issues had now settled down and that problems with the operating theatres should be dealt with by the end of this week. By the start of next week about 77 per cent of outpatient clinics should be working properly on the new system, with everything expected to be running to plan by the week of February 13. "I do not know how many letters have gone out in error but would like to think it was a really small proportion of the total letters," he said. "We know we had to cancel some people because their notes didn't arrive. We have been supporting staff in theatres and they have done everything they can. Very small numbers have been affected." He said the theatres data had been 80 per cent correct but he was not sure which 20 per cent was wrong. NBT said it was sure the issue was not with the Cerner system itself but issues that had occurred in its implementation.
Mr Bell said that he and his team have been working with Cerner to fix the problems but it took time to "get on top of the issues" and rebuild and relaunch clinics on the system. He added: "I would not have let it go through if I had known the problems we were going to have."NBT chairman Peter Rilett said: "Quite why we were trying to launch something that was not fit for purpose when we went through all the simulations we could do, it will be a matter for pretty urgent review." Medical director Christopher Bur - ton said processes were put in place as soon as they realised the problems and patients with an urgent medical need or those with cancer were prioritised. "There has had to be a process where professional clinicians have made a judgement about whether it is safe for them to provide and whether they are able to provide healthcare for individuals before the information is available," Dr Burton said. "Individual judgements are being made about that and on occasion we have had to advise patients that we are unable to treat them at that point. It has caused significant disruption to some individuals but the process ensures that these patients do receive the treatment they do need and are not put at risk, even though it no doubt caused inconvenience to a number of people." Chief executive Ruth Brunt said information has been put up on the NBT website, sent out to GPs and a dedicated hotline had been set up.
"We are also putting some mitigating factors in place to pay for the inconvenience caused to patients, offering free car-parking when they next have to come," she said. "We recognise this has been a very poor experience for some of our patients. I am working at the highest level with our provider Cerner and am in contact with their chief executive. They are as committed as we are to ensure that we learn lessons from the problems. "I will be commissioning an independent review of this situation and Cerner are committed to that." ? NORTH Bristol NHS Trust has moved to the Cerner Millennium system to manage outpatient appointments and inpatient bookings electronically. The transfer from the old computer system was gradual and started with the emergency department at Frenchay followed by minor injuries and ward areas. Transferring systems in operating theatres followed, then outpatient clinics. Mr Bell said he knew there would be some issues moving to the system but once it had bedded in he expected it to become a complete patient record, replacing paper files. He said that over time the new system could enable the trust to set up flags for patients at risk of falls or developing pressure ulcers so that doctors and nurses could take precautionary actions. And within about six months he hopes that doctors will be making their patient notes in the system so that information is available on the computer as soon as a patient is admitted.
