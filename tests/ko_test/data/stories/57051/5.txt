Russian spacecraft destined for death

A Russian spacecraft designed to burnish the nation's faded space glory in a mission to one of Mars' moons has turned into one of the heaviest, most toxic pieces of space junk ever.
It will come crashing down to Earth in just a few days.
The Russian space agency Roscosmos' latest forecast has the unmanned Phobos-Ground probe falling out of Earth's orbit Sunday or Monday, with the median time placing it over the Indian Ocean north of Madagascar.
It said the precise time and place of its uncontrolled plunge can only be determined later, and unless someone actually spots fiery streaks in the sky, no one may ever know where any surviving pieces end up.
At 14.6 tons, the Phobos-Ground is one of the heaviest spacecraft ever to plummet to Earth. It's cylindrical and about the size of a van.
Roscosmos predicted that only 20 to 30 fragments of the Phobos probe with a total weight of up to 440 pounds will survive the re-entry and plummet to Earth.
It's the third satellite to crash out of the sky in less than five months: An old NASA 6-ton atmospheric research satellite came tumbling down in September, and a 3-ton German science satellite followed suit in October, both landing in water.
Both were aging. But Phobos-Ground was launched in November, and a glitch left it stranded in orbit around Earth instead of bound for Mars to collect soil samples.
The 12 tons of highly toxic rocket fuel aboard Phobos-Ground account for the bulk of its weight for the long journey to the Martian moon of Phobos. Roscosmos insists all the fuel will burn in the atmosphere and pose no danger, and some experts in Russia and the West share that view.
Some experts theorized, however, that part of the fuel might have frozen in the cold of space and could survive the fiery descent, posing a strong threat if it spills over populated areas.
Such fears prompted the United States to shoot down its USA-193 spy satellite with a Navy missile in 2008.
Some botched Russian rocket launches in the past have showered fragments over populated areas in Siberia and neighboring Kazakhstan.
