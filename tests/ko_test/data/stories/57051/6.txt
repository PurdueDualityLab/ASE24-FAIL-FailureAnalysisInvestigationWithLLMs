BRIAN WILLIAMS, anchor:
It looks like we have another piece of space junk to look out for. This will be the third in five months, by the way. This time it's different. It's a Russian spacecraft and at 14 and a half tons, it's one of the largest and heaviest ever to plummet uncontrollably to Earth. It was just launched in November on a mission to Mars, but an electronic glitch left it in Earth--in space. The Russians are assuring the world only about 20 or 30 of the heavier chunks are likely to survive re-entry to Earth's orbit. The latest forecast has this thing crash landing Sunday or Monday, perhaps over the Indian Ocean, potentially close to Madagascar. If so, they'll have to move it, move it. But we all know a lot more information will be coming as the weekend approaches.
