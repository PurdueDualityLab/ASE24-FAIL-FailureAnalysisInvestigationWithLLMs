BRIAN WILLIAMS, anchor:
A quick update on a couple of situations we were following for you last week. The fuel tanker that was stuck in the ice in the Bering Sea was finally freed with the help of that ice-breaking vessel, and has arrived finally at its destination port in Nome, Alaska.
And the Russian-made Mars satellite that never made it to Mars, never made it out of Earth's orbit because of an electrical glitch, has fallen back to Earth. Russian news agencies say it apparently fell into open ocean, the Pacific, far off the Chilean coast. The concern was at 14 tons it was among the largest pieces of space junk ever to re-enter our atmosphere.
