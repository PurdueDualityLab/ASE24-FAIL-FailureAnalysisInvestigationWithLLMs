A RUSSIAN spacecraftdesigned to burnish the nation's faded space glory in a mission to one of Mars' moons has turned into one of the heaviest, most toxic pieces of space junk ever.
It will come crashing down to Earth in just a few days.
The Russian space agencyRoscosmos' latest forecast has the unmanned Phobos-Ground probe falling out of Earth's orbit Sunday or Monday, with the median time placing it over the Indian Ocean just north of Madagascar.
It said the precise timeand place of its uncontrolled plunge can only be determined later, and that unless someone actually spots fiery streaks in the sky, no one might ever know where any surviving pieces end up.
Space experts agree it's unlikely to pose big risks.
At 14.6 tons, thePhobos-Ground is one of the heaviest spacecraft ever to plummet to Earth, considerably larger than the two defunct satellites that fell to Earth last fall and landed in the water. It's cylindrical and about the size of a van.
Roscosmos predicted thatonly 20 to 30 fragments of the Phobos probe with a total weight of up to 440 pounds would survive the re- entry and hit Earth.
This is the thirdsatellite to crash out of the sky in less than five months: An old NASA 6-ton atmospheric research satellite came tumbling down in September, and a 3-ton German science satellite followed in October. But both were well past their prime.
Russia's Phobos-Ground probe is still a mere babe. It was launched in November, and a glitch left it stranded in orbit around Earth instead of bound for Mars to collect soil samples.
"What's different aboutthis re-entry is that it's not a re- entry of an old, inert satellite that just was expected for years. It's something that is coming down because of an accident. ... For me, that puts it in a different category," said Jonathan McDowell of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.
Another strikingdifference is the 12 tons of highly toxic rocket fuel aboard Phobos-Ground, accounting for the bulk of its weight for the long journey to the Martian moon Phobos. This makes it potentially the most toxic spacecraft to fall ever.
Roscosmos insists all thefuel will burn up in the atmosphere and pose no danger, and some experts in Russia and the West share that forecast.
And if it's any consolation, both of the two previous uncontrolled satellites harmlessly showered fragments over water.
The Phobos-Ground is oneof the heaviest and most toxic spacecraft ever to plummet to Earth. But the Russian space agency Roscosmos predicts that only 20 to 30 fragments of the failed Mars probe, with a total weight of up to 440 pounds, will survive the re- entry and hit the planet.
