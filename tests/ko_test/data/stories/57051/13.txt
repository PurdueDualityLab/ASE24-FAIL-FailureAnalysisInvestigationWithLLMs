Fiery return to Earth imminent for toxic Russian space probe

MOSCOW -- A Russianspacecraft designed to burnish the nation's faded space glory in a mission to one of Mars's moons has turned into one of the heaviest, most toxic pieces of space junk ever.
It will come crashing down to Earth in just a few days.
Russian space agencyRoscosmos's latest forecast has the unmanned Phobos-Ground probe falling out of Earth's orbit Sunday or Monday, with the median time placing it over the Indian Ocean north of Madagascar. It said the precise time and place of its plunge can only be determined later, and unless someone actually spots fiery streaks in the sky, no one may ever know where any surviving pieces end up.
Space experts agree it's unlikely to pose big risks.
At 13.2 metric tonnes,the Phobos-Ground is one of the heaviest spacecraft ever to plummet to Earth, considerably larger than the two defunct satellites that fell to Earth last fall and landed in the water. It's cylindrical and about the size of a van.
Roscosmos predicted thatonly between 20 and 30 fragments of the Phobos probe with a total weight of up to 200 kilograms will survive re-entry and plummet to Earth.
It's the third satelliteto crash out of the sky in under five months: An old NASA six-tonne atmospheric research satellite came tumbling down in September, and a three-tonne German science satellite followed suit in October. But both were well past their prime.
"What's different aboutthis re-entry is that it's not a re-entry of an old, inert satellite that just was expected for years. It's something that is coming down because of an accident . . . for me, that puts it in a different category," said Jonathan McDowell of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.
Another strikingdifference is the 11 metric tonnes of highly toxic rocket fuel aboard Phobos-Ground, accounting for the bulk of its weight for the long journey to the Martian moon of Phobos. This makes it potentially the most toxic spacecraft to fall ever.
Roscosmos insists all thefuel will burn in the atmosphere and pose no danger, and some experts in Russia and the West share that forecast.
"The fuel indeed poseslethal danger in case of close contact, but I haven't heard of a single case of any civilians poisoned by rocket fuel from all the derelict satellites and failed rockets throughout the space era," said Igor Lissov, an independent Moscow-based space observer. "The objective reality is that it burns on re-entry. There is no reason to panic."
Some experts theorized,however, that part of the fuel might have frozen in the cold of space and could survive the fiery descent, posing a strong threat if it spills over populated areas. Such fears prompted the United States to shoot down its USA-193 spy satellite with a Navy missile in 2008.
Engineers from theMoscow-based company NPO Lavochkin, which built the Mars probe, said in an article giving a detailed description of the design that its fuel tanks are made of aluminum alloy. That means they should melt early on re-entry, backing up official assurances that the fuel would burn up on its way down.
The $170-millionPhobos-Ground mission was Russia's most expensive and the most ambitious space endeavour since Soviet times. The spacecraft was intended to land on the crater-dented, potato-shaped Martian moon, collect soil samples and fly them back to Earth, giving scientists precious materials that could shed more light on the genesis of the solar system.
The probe wassuccessfully launched Nov. 9 and entered a preliminary orbit where its engines were supposed to fire to set it on its path to Mars. They never did, and attempts to fix the glitch by Russian and European Space Agency experts failed.
