Back in Business: Air Canada turned fortunes around in '04, while WestJet lost its golden touch

With $1.9 billion in cash in its pocket, a smaller debt load and lower operating costs, the newly restructured Air Canada found itself in a new role in 2004 -- on the offensive against discount rival WestJet Airlines.
After years of eating away at the legacy carrier's market, it was WestJet that was on its heels, as profits and share price dropped and Air Canada filed a $220-million lawsuit alleging WestJet executives engaged in corporate espionage.
Air Canada exited creditor protection at the end of September with a new lease on life and started generating solid results even as the global airline industry continued to be squeezed by high jet fuel costs and a soft business travel market.
Often flirting with disaster during what was a torturous 18-month restructuring under creditor protection, Air Canada cut $2 billion a year in costs including more than $1 billion a year from its employees.
It is buying new aircraft, its flights have fewer empty seats and Air Canada management says the Montreal-based airline is on course to profitability next year with plans to add new international destinations.
'There is no vestige of the legacy carrier remaining,' chief executive Robert Milton said in a recent speech in New York.
'Everything is different. Our balance sheet doesn't look the same. Our cost structure isn't the same. How we sell our product isn't the same. Even our livery and uniforms aren't the same.
'Air Canada can no longer be considered a legacy carrier.'
What a difference a year can make.
A year ago Air Canada was locked in a court battle over who would be its partner in restructuring, with Victor Li's Trinity Time investment group threatening to walk away.
With no plan on the horizon to solve a massive pension deficit, the airline's emergence from creditor protection was far from certain.
This year, Air Canada recorded its eighth consecutive month of record load factor or proportion of seats filled in November with 74.6 per cent of the airline's seats filled.
In the first six weeks shares after Air Canada's new parent started trading, they rose about one-third from their opening price of $24 on Oct. 28. They were trading above $32 on Thursday at the Toronto Stock Exchange.
However WestJet headed the opposite direction in 2004.
It should have been a banner year for WestJet. The airline launched its much anticipated foray into the United States and moved its eastern hub to Toronto, from Hamilton, in a bid to increase traffic.
But hammered by higher operating costs as the price of oil topped $50 US per barrel and the increased costs of operating at Toronto's Pearson Airport, WestJet's profitability fell and with it went the company's shares.
Hampered by a computer glitch in its reservation system, in the airline's November load factor fell to 58.5 per cent from 64.1 per cent in 2003.
WestJet shares, which started the year at $18.97 and traded as high as $21.13, traded below $12 on the Toronto market.
RBC Capital Markets analyst Nick Morton said WestJet's launch of the transborder routes has been disappointing.
'Reasons include hurricanes in Florida coincide with the September launch, and the Toronto-L.A. route has failed to attract enough passengers and will be dropped in mid-December.
'WestJet lacks the brand recognition at its U.S. destinations with the result that nearly all its bookings come from Canadians. In Toronto it has faced very tough competition from Jetsgo on its transborder routes.'
Morton also suggested WestJet faces a possible writedown of 18 old Boeing 737-200s that could cost the airline $55 million next year.
And WestJet's troubles spilled over into the courtroom this year as it has also been forced to defend allegations of corporate espionage by Air Canada.
The carrier accused Calgary-based WestJet of using an Air Canada employee travel website to access information on passenger loads on its flights. Air Canada alleges the information could be used to identify which were its most profitable routes and times.
WestJet countered with accusations Air Canada hired private investigators to sift through an employee's trash and then had a U.S. firm digitally reconstruct shredded documents containing information on Air Canada flights.
WestJet CEO Clive Beddoe said this year that he offered to resign over the fiasco, but the WestJet board refused.
Beddoe has said he does not think Air Canada wants to settle the issue out of court.
'They don't want a settlement, they want to keep giving us a black eye every opportunity they can,' he said in November.
Compounding problems for WestJet, Montreal-based discount rival Jetsgo filed a $50-million lawsuit naming Beddoe and WestJet co-founder and former vice-president of strategic planning, Mark Hill.
While WestJet still maintains a cost advantage over Air Canada, it has suffered as other discount carriers have moved into its space, offering cheap seats with no frills.
And headed into next year, WestJet will face another threat as Jetsgo expands its operations in western Canada with new routes to Saskatoon, Kelowna, Fort McMurray, Alta., and Prince George.
Jetsgo also says it will add year-around flights to Abbotsford and Victoria, two destinations it had up until now served only seasonally. Jetsgo is a privately held company that doesn't release financial results.
Meanwhile, ACE Aviation Holdings, Air Canada's new parent company after it completed its restructuring, reported a reduced third-quarter loss of $81 million.
Excluding the restructuring charges, the airline said it earned operating income of $243 million, up from $17 million a year ago.
