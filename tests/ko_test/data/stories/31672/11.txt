Discount airline Jetsgo has added four Western Canadian cities to its schedule to compete with rivals Air Canada and WestJet Airlines Ltd.
Jetsgo will fly to Prince George and Kelowna, in British Columbia, Fort McMurray in Alberta, and Saskatoon starting on Jan. 10. The closely held airline based in Montreal has also expanded its flights to Victoria and Abbotsford, B.C., offering year-round service.
The Western Canada expansion marks a new direction for Jetsgo, which previously focused on adding service and frequency to Eastern Canada and the United States. Jetsgo now offers scheduled flights to 19 Canadian and 10 U.S. destinations.
Chief operating officer Michael Granshaw said high pricing by other airlines prompted Jetsgo to expand in Western Canada. Jetsgo flights start at $49 each way, plus taxes and other charges.
"When we started to look at the markets, quite frankly, we saw pricing that was not competitive," he said in a telephone interview yesterday. "Some of the city pairs we're going to be flying we'll be providing what I feel is a low-cost alternative."
"We are very proud of the fact that we are now the only discount airline flying to every province and we've done it in less than two-and-a-half years since our launch in June, 2002," said Michel Leblanc, president and CEO of Jetsgo.
The Jetsgo routes will compete with Air Canada and its Jazz unit, as well as Calgary-based WestJet.
The expansion has been made possible by delivery of additional Fokker F-100 aircraft, which has boosted its fleet to 25 planes.
The attack on WestJet's stronghold comes as analysts speculate whether its astounding run of profitability may sputter next quarter.
WestJet said on Tuesday its load factor in November was 58.5%, down from 64% a year earlier, because of technical problems with its inventory management. That glitch, the airline said, meant its lowest fares and available seats were not always published on its Web site.
It also warned some computer problems remain to be resolved.
The weak load factors -- the lowest in WestJet's history as a public company -- come hard on the heels of disappointing numbers in October. And analysts say signs point to soft load factors in December as well.
"We now expect WestJet to report a loss in both Q4 and Q1/05," analyst Cameron Doerksen at Dlouhy Merchant said in a note. Following 31 consecutive months of profitability, that would be a "psychological blow" for the company, Mr. Doerksen said. He cut his rating on the company to hold from buy and was among several analysts to tweak the price target lower.
Mr. Doerksen said WestJet could post a loss of 2 cents a share in the fourth quarter versus his previous estimate for a profit of 4 cents.
WestJet has struggled throughout 2004 to balance load factors -- or percentage of available seats filled -- with yields, or profits as it battles intense competition and high fuel prices.
