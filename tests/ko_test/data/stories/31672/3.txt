Analysts chopped their fourth-quarter profit estimates for WestJet Airlines Ltd. yesterday and warned of turbulence in its share price, mainly because of computer woes that hurt its online bookings.
WestJet shares were off 57 cents, or 4.6 per cent, at $11.73 yesterday, well below their year high of $21.13.
At Dlouhy Merchant, Cameron Doerksen forecast a loss for the Calgary-based no frills carrier in both the fourth-quarter of this year and first quarter of next year.
'Since the company has strung together 31 consecutive quarters of profitability, a reported loss will likely be a psychological blow for the stock,' Doerksen wrote in a research report.
Doerksen lowered his fourth-quarter forecast to a loss of 2 cents a share from a profit of 4 cents a share and cut his rating to 'hold' from 'buy.'
On Tuesday, WestJet said its load factor tumbled to 58.5 per cent from 64.1 per cent a year earlier, largely because computer glitches prevented the carrier's online reservations system from showing its best prices.
A key measure of an airline's financial performance, passenger load factor measures the average number of seats sold as a proportion of those available.
Analysts said WestJet's November load factor was its lowest since the airline's inception in 1996.
The carrier, Number 2 to Montreal-based Air Canada, has seen its profit margins squeezed this year by higher fuel prices and as it expands seat capacity.
Tim James, analyst at Octagon Capital, forecast a 1 cent loss at WestJet in the fourth quarter and trimmed his fiscal 2004 estimate for per share profit to 22 cents from 29 cents. He maintained his 'buy' recommendation, saying the shares are undervalued.
Research Capital analyst Jacques Kavafian slashed his fourth-quarter profit estimate for WestJet to break even from earnings of 9 cents a share. He also reduced his full year 2004 estimate to a profit of 22 cents from 33 cents a share.
He also maintained his 'buy' recommendation on the stock.
Before analysts began revising their WestJet estimates, the average forecast had been for a profit of 8 cents a share in the fourth quarter, according to Reuters Estimates. By yesterday afternoon, that average was reduced to 6 cents a share, with estimates ranging from a profit of 14 cents to a loss of 5 cents.
