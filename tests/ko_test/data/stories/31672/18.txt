The Financial Post reports in its Wednesday edition that WestJet Airlines could be heading toward its first loss after 31 profitable quarters after customer traffic on the company's flights dropped dramatically in November because of problems with its computerized booking system, analysts said Tuesday. The Post's Robert Thompson quotes Dlouhy Merchant analyst Cameron Doerksen telling clients in a note: "Based on our new forecast, we now expect WestJet to report a loss in Q4. Since the company has strung together 31 consecutive quarters to profitability, a reported loss will likely be a psychological blow for the stock." WestJet said its load factor, or the percentage of available seats that are occupied on a flight, fell to 58.5 per cent in November from 64.1 per cent in the same period a year earlier. The company's load factor until November was 69.5 per cent, down from 70.3 per cent in 2003. WestJet stock fell to close at $12.60 in Toronto.
WestJet chief executive officer Clive Beddoe said the drop in customer traffic was due to problems within WestJet's computerized booking system. The booking system would not always display the best prices available.
