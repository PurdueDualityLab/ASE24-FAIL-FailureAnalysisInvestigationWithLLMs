Computer woes sink WestJet traffic

WestJet Airlines Ltd. blamed computer hang-ups for more empty seats on its planes in November as its much larger rival, Air Canada, reported another month of record passenger loads.
Calgary-based WestJet, the country's second-largest carrier, said Tuesday that its load factor -- a key airline measure of seats occupied on planes -- was 58.5 per cent, down from 64 per cent during the same month a year ago.
Air Canada, which emerged from bankruptcy protection at the end of September, said its November loads rose to nearly 75 per cent, more than five points higher than the same month last year.
WestJet chief executive Clive Beddoe said the airline's 'disappointingly low' traffic figures were due to a series of computer problems with revenue and inventory management systems.
'At times, these failures prevented us from adjusting our fares quickly and displaying our seat inventory accurately,' he said in a statement.
The technical glitches meant passengers were not always quoted the lowest fares available and prevented the airline from stimulating the market by dropping fares or quickly matching competitor's prices.
'As a result, many potential guests did not book with WestJet,' Beddoe said.
The discount carrier said it has fixed most of the computer trouble, but didn't say how long it would take to correct remaining problems.
It is also replacing its fare and inventory management systems.
'We're continuing to work through that process,' said spokeswoman Siobhan Vinish.
'We have a number of manual processes in place right now that are allowing us to continue to watch fares and match fares and be competitive.'
WestJet, which flies to 24 Canadian cities, has been on a rapid expansion throughout the country, adding planes, routes and increasing frequency of some flights. The airline also started flying to seven U.S. destinations this fall and will begin a Calgary-Palm Springs route in January.
WestJet's revenue passenger miles -- the number of paid-for seats multiplied by the distance flown -- rose 19 per cent in November, and are up 30 per cent since the beginning of the year.
Year-to-date, the airline's capacity has increased 30 per cent over the same period in 2003.
Analysts noted the weak load numbers follow several months of lower traffic for WestJet, which has faced increased pressure from other discount competitors such as Jetsgo, a Montreal-based airline, as well as a revamped Air Canada.
'They (WestJet) are still adding a lot of capacity; that hurts,' said Cameron Doerksen of Dlouthy Merchants in Montreal.
'They've added a significant number of new routes, especially on the trans-border market and it takes a while for those to develop.
'And just generally, competition in the domestic market is pretty fierce right now and that is making it pretty difficult.'
Air Canada said its load levels reached 74.6 per cent -- the highest for the airline in November, traditionally a slow month for the airline industry. That compares with 69 per cent during the same month last year.
'In November we achieved another month of record system and North America load factors as we continued to generate solid traffic growth while reducing overall capacity,' said Rob Peterson, Air Canada's chief financial officer.
'We are clearly the airline of choice for the lowest fares to the greatest number of destinations on an everyday basis.'
Air Canada trimmed its capacity by about four per cent as the restructured airline cut routes, mostly in the domestic market.
The carrier is benefiting from a rebound in the travel sector, especially on its international routes, said Doerksen.
'As long as those markets are strong, it's going to benefit the domestic market,' he said.
On the Toronto stock exchange Tuesday, WestJet shares closed down 20 cents to $12.30 while shares of ACE Aviation Holdings Inc., Air Canada's parent company, rose 94 cents to a new high of $31.74.
