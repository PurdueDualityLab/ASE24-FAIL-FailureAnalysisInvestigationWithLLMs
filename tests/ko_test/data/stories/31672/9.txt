WestJet Airlines Ltd., its stock battered by allegations that its executives engaged in corporate espionage, suffered another blow yesterday when the airline posted its lowest November load factor in six years as a publicly traded company.
An important measure of an airline's financial success, load factor, or the percentage of WestJet's filled seats, was 58.5 per cent for the month, down from 64.1 per cent a year earlier, the no-frills carrier said.
WestJet's previous November low was 62.5 per cent in 2002.
WestJet blamed the decline on a computer glitch that prevented the company from "adjusting our fares quickly and displaying our seat inventory accurately," said Clive Beddoe, the company's president and CEO. As a result, "many potential guests did not book with WestJet."
"Our November load factor was disappointingly low due in large part to a series of computer system failures involving our revenue and inventory management systems."
The Calgary company reported traffic for November rose 19.4 per cent to 467.2 million revenue passenger miles. A revenue passenger mile is one paying passenger flown one mile.
WestJet has fallen on hard times this year. Its stock has plunged by one-third in 2004, and larger rival Air Canada emerged from its recent bankruptcy protection after halving its $12 billion worth of debt.
"Growth opportunities are not as plentiful as they were when (WestJet) was a much smaller carrier and the prime carrier, Air Canada, was a relatively more bloated legacy carrier," investment bank Credit Suisse First Boston said of WestJet in a Nov. 29 research report.
Air Canada yesterday reported its system-wide load factor was 74.6 per cent in November - a record for the month - up from 69.2 per cent a year earlier when the bookings were still recovering from the SARS outbreak. Passenger traffic at Air Canada's mainline carrier rose 3.9 per cent. Capacity fell 3.6 per cent.
