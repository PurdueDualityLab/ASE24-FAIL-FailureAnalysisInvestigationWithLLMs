WestJet had more empty seats

CALGARY -- WestJet Airlines Ltd. blamed computer hangups for more empty seats on its planes in November as its much larger rival Air Canada reported another month of record passenger loads.
Calgary-based WestJet, the country's second largest carrier, said Tuesday that its load factor -- a key airline measure of seats occupied on planes -- was 58.5 per cent, down from 64 per cent during the same month a year ago.
Air Canada, which emerged from bankruptcy protection at the end of September, said its November loads rose to nearly 75 per cent -- more than five points higher than the same month last year.
WestJet chief executive Clive Beddoe said the 'disappointingly low' traffic figures were due to a series of computer problems with revenue and inventory management systems.
'At times, these failures prevented us from adjusting our fares quickly and displaying our seat inventory accurately,' he said in a statement.
The technical glitches meant passengers were not always quoted the lowest fares available and prevented the airline from stimulating the market by dropping fares or quickly matching competitor's prices.
