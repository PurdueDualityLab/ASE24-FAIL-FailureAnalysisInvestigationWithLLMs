CALGARY - WestJet Airlines Ltd. blames computer hangups for more empty seats on its planes in November -- another month of record passenger loads for its much larger rival, Air Canada.
Calgary-based WestJet, the country's second-largest carrier, said Tuesday that its load factor -- a key airline measure of seats occupied on planes -- was 58.5 per cent, compared with 64 per cent during the same month a year ago.
Air Canada, which emerged from bankruptcy protection at the end of September, said its November loads hit nearly 75 per cent -- more than five points higher than during the same month last year.
WestJet chief executive Clive Beddoe said the 'disappointingly low' traffic was due to a series of computer problems with revenue and inventory management systems.
'At times, these failures prevented us from adjusting our fares quickly and displaying our seat inventory accurately,' he said in a news release.
The technical glitches meant passengers weren't always quoted the lowest fares available and kept the airline from quickly matching competitors' prices.
'As a result, many potential guests did not book with WestJet,' Beddoe said.
WestJet, which flies to 24 Canadian cities, has been expanding rapidly throughout the country, adding planes and routes, and increasing the frequency of some flights.
The airline also started flying to seven U.S. destinations this fall.
WestJet's revenue passenger miles -- the number of paid-for seats multiplied by the distance flown -- rose 19 per cent in November, and are up 30 per cent since the start of the year.
Analysts noted the weak load numbers follow several months of lower traffic for WestJet, which has faced increased pressure from other discount competitors such as Montreal-based Jetsgo, as well as a revamped Air Canada.
Air Canada said its load levels reached 74.6 per cent -- the highest ever for the airline in November, traditionally a slow month for the airline industry. That compares with 69 per cent during the same month last year.
'In November we achieved another month of record system and North America load factors as we continued to generate solid traffic growth while reducing overall capacity,' said Rob Peterson, Air Canada's chief financial officer.
'We are clearly the airline of choice for the lowest fares to the greatest number of destinations on an everyday basis.'
In Toronto on Tuesday,WestJet shares closed down 20 cents to $12.30 while shares of ACE Aviation Holdings Inc., Air Canada's parent company, rose 94 cents to a new high of $31.74.
