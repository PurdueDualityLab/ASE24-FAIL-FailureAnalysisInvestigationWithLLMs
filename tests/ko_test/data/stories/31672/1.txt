Computer gremlins take big bite out of ticket purchases

Investors clipped WestJet's wings yesterday after the company said it flew with only 58.5 per cent of its seats filled in November.
The Calgary-based airline said capacity rose sharply while computer gremlins took a bite out of ticket purchases.
WestJet's available seat miles -- the number of seats in its fleet multiplied by total miles flown -- rose by 31 per cent from November, 2003 to 798.7 million.
The less-than-pleasant news was that revenue-passenger miles -- the number of seats sold multiplied by miles flown -- rose only 19.4 per cent to 467.2 million.
The result was the load factor -- the proportion of seats filled -- fell to 58.5 per cent from 64.1 per cent in November of last year.
'Our November load factor was disappointingly low due in large part to a series of computer system failures involving our revenue and inventory management systems,' CEO Clive Beddoe said.
'At times, these failures prevented us from adjusting our fares quickly and displaying our seat inventory accurately.'
The upshot was that air travellers were prevented from booking at the lowest available fares, Beddoe said.
The computer glitches 'inhibited our ability to stimulate segments of the market and respond to competitive pricing in other areas. As a result, many potential guests did not book with WestJet,' he said.
Yesterday's share-price decline of 1.6 per cent leaves the airline cruising near the lower end of its 52-week high/low of $31.70 and $10.19.
