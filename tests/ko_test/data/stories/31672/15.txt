WestJet passenger load drops; Air Canada enjoys record November: Calgary-based airline blames computer glitches for inability to adjust fares quickly

CALGARY - WestJet Airlines Ltd. blamed computer hangups for more empty seats on its planes in November, while much larger Air Canada reported another month of record passenger loads.
Calgary-based WestJet, the country's second-largest carrier, said yesterday that its load factor -- a key airline measure of seats occupied on planes -- was 58.5 per cent, down from 64 per cent in November 2003.
Air Canada, which emerged from bankruptcy protection at the end of September, said its November loads rose to nearly 75 per cent, more than five points higher than the same month last year.
WestJet chief executive Clive Beddoe attributed the 'disappointingly low' traffic figures to computer problems with revenue and inventory management systems. 'At times, these failures prevented us from adjusting our fares quickly and displaying our seat inventory accurately,' he said in a statement.
The technical glitches meant passengers were not always quoted the lowest fares available and prevented the airline from stimulating the market by dropping fares or quickly matching competitor's prices.
'As a result, many potential guests did not book with WestJet,' Mr. Beddoe said.
The discount carrier said it had fixed most of the computer trouble, but did not indicate how long it would take to correct remaining problems. It is also replacing its fare and inventory management systems.
'We're continuing to work through that process,' spokeswoman Siobhan Vinish said. 'We have a number of manual processes in place right now that are allowing us to continue to watch fares and match fares and be competitive.'
WestJet, which flies to 24 Canadian cities, has been on a rapid expansion throughout the country, adding planes and routes and increasing frequency of some flights. The airline also started flying to seven U.S. destinations this fall.
WestJet's revenue passenger miles -- the number of paid-for seats multiplied by the distance flown -- rose 19 per cent in November, and were up 30 per cent since the start of the year.
Year to date, the airline's capacity has increased 30 per cent over the same 2003 period.
Analysts noted the weak load numbers follow several months of lower traffic for WestJet.
'(WestJet is) still adding a lot of capacity; that hurts,' said Cameron Doerksen of Dlouthy Merchants in Montreal. 'They've added a significant number of new routes, especially on the transborder market, and it takes a while for those to develop.
'And, just generally, competition in the domestic market is pretty fierce right now and that is making it pretty difficult.'
Air Canada said its load levels reached 74.6 per cent, the highest ever for the airline in November, traditionally a slow month for the airline industry. That compared with 69 per cent in November 2003.
'In November, we achieved another month of record system and North America load factors as we continued to generate solid traffic growth while reducing overall capacity,' said Rob Peterson, Air Canada's chief financial officer.
Air Canada trimmed its capacity about four per cent as the restructured airline cut routes, mostly in the domestic market.
