Air Canada and WestJet see their fortunes reversed; Resurgent national carrier takes on western nemesis

Newly restructured Air Canada has $1.9 billion in cash in its pocket, a smaller debt load and lower operating costs in 2004. It also found itself in a new role -- on the offensive against discount rival WestJet Airlines.
After years of eating away at the legacy carrier's market, it was WestJet that was on its heels as profits and share price dropped and Air Canada filed a $220-million lawsuit alleging WestJet executives engaged in corporate espionage.
Air Canada came out of creditor protection at the end of September with a new lease on life. It started generating solid results even as the global airline industry continued to be squeezed by high jet fuel costs and a soft business travel market.
Often flirting with disaster during a tortuous 18-month restructuring while under creditor protection, Air Canada cut $2 billion a year in costs including more than $1 billion a year from its employees. It is buying new aircraft, flights have fewer empty seats and management says it's on course for profitability next year with plans to add new international destinations.
"Everything is different," chief executive Robert Milton said in a recent speech in New York. "Our balance sheet doesn't look the same. Our cost structure isn't the same. How we sell our product isn't the same. Even our livery and uniforms aren't the same."
A year ago Air Canada was locked in a court battle over who would be its partner in restructuring, with Victor Li's Trinity Time investment group threatening to walk away.
With no plan on the horizon to solve a massive pension deficit, the airline's emergence from creditor protection was far from certain. This year, Air Canada recorded its eighth consecutive month of record load factor or proportion of seats filled. In November, 74.6 per cent of seats were filled.
WestJet headed in the opposite direction in 2004, which should have been a banner year. It launched its much anticipated foray into the U.S. and moved its eastern hub to Toronto from Hamilton in a bid to raise traffic.
But WestJet's profitability fell, hammered by higher operating costs as the price of oil topped $50 US a barrel and the increased costs of operating at Pearson Airport.
Hampered by a computer glitch in its reservation system, November's load factor fell to 58.5 per cent from 64.1 per cent in 2003.
RBC Capital Markets analyst Nick Morton said WestJet's launch of transborder routes has been disappointing.
Reasons include hurricanes in Florida that coincided with the September launch. In addition, the Toronto-L.A. route has failed to attract enough passengers and will be dropped in mid-December, Morton said.
"WestJet lacks the brand recognition at its U.S. destinations, with the result that nearly all its bookings come from Canadians. In Toronto, it has faced very tough competition from Jetsgo on its transborder routes," Morton said.
WestJet's troubles spilled over into the courtroom this year, as it has also been forced to defend allegations of corporate espionage from Air Canada. It accused WestJet of using an Air Canada employee travel website to access information on passenger loads on its flights. Air Canada alleges the information could be used to identify which were its most profitable routes and times.
WestJet countered with accusations Air Canada hired private investigators to sift through an employee's trash and then had a U.S. firm digitally reconstruct shredded documents containing information on Air Canada flights.
Compounding problems for WestJet, Montreal-based discount rival Jetsgo filed a $50-million lawsuit naming WestJet CEO Clive Beddoe and WestJet co-founder and former vice-president of strategic planning, Mark Hill.
While WestJet still maintains a cost advantage over Air Canada, it has suffered as other discount carriers have moved into its space, offering cheap seats with no frills.
Headed into next year, WestJet will face another threat as Jetsgo expands its operations in Western Canada.
Jetsgo says it will add year-round flights to Abbotsford and Victoria, B.C., destinations it had up until now served only seasonally.
Jetsgo is a privately held company that doesn't release financial results.
