WestJet Shares Slip As Profit Outlook Questioned

TORONTO (Dow Jones)--WestJet Airlines Ltd. (WJA.T) is lower Wednesday as analysts speculate whether its astounding run of profitability may sputter next quarter.
In Toronto, the discount airline's shares are off 57 Canadian cents to C$11.73 on volume of about 354,000. Earlier in the day the stock fell to C$11.50.
WestJet said Tuesday its load factor in November was 58.5%, down from 64% a year earlier, because of technical problems with its inventory management. That glitch, the airline said, meant its lowest fares and available seats weren't always published on its Web site.
It also warned some computer problems remain to be resolved.
The weak load factors - the lowest in WestJet's history as a public company - come hard on the heels of disappointing numbers in October. And analysts say signs point to soft load factors in December as well.
"We now expect WestJet to report a loss in both Q4 and Q1/05," analyst Cameron Doerksen at Dlouhy Merchant said in a note. Following 31 consecutive months of profitability, that would be a "psychological blow" for the company, Doerksen said. He cut his rating on the company to Hold from Buy and was among several analysts to tweak the price target lower.
Doerksen said WestJet could post a loss of 2 Canadian cents a share in the fourth quarter versus his previous estimate for a profit of 4 Canadian cents.
Other analysts agreed: Research Capital said it now expects breakeven earnings for the fourth quarter compared to its previous estimate of 9 Canadian cents a share, while TD Newcrest cut its outlook to a loss of 2 Canadian cents from net of 3 Canadian cents. Octagon Securities is forecasting a fourth-quarter loss of 1 Canadian cent a share.
WestJet has struggled throughout 2004 to balance load factors - or percentage of available seats filled - with yields, or profits as it battles intense competition and high fuel prices.
Aggravating matters has been its recent strategic moves to begin flying to U.S. destinations and transfer its eastern Canadian hub to Toronto from Hamilton. Analysts say load factors are always depressed when airlines enter new and untested markets.
"We continue to believe that the ongoing startup of U.S. destinations combined with the competitive domestic environment will continue to pressure yields for the remainder of the year," TD Newcrest noted, although it said that could be partially offset by charter operations to sun destinations this winter.
Doerksen said that while the computer problems may have caused the biggest impact on load factors, WestJet's rapid expansion - particularly in eastern Canada - could also have played a role. Competition is fierce in the region where WestJet is a relatively new player.
Upping the ante somewhat, Montreal-based Jetsgo announced Wednesday a dramatic expansion of its flights to western Canada, WestJet's traditional stronghold.
Meanwhile, legacy airline Air Canada (ACNA.YY) has boasted record load factors in recent months as it leverages its global network amid a surge in international airline traffic. Its load factor in November rose to 77.7% from 74%.
Shares of Air Canada's parent Ace Aviation Holdings (ACE.B.T) are up 16 Canadian cents to C$31.90, its highest since emerging from bankruptcy protection at the end of September.
WestJet shares have lost about 38% of their value so far this year. The company has also been hurt by allegations of corporate espionage made by both Air Canada and Jetsgo. The allegations have not yet been proven in court.
Dlouhy Merchant has an investment-banking relationship with WestJet but Doerksen doesn't own the company's shares. Neither TD Newcrest nor Research Capital have investment banking relationships with the company, while Octagon Capital has had an investment-banking relationship in the past three years.
