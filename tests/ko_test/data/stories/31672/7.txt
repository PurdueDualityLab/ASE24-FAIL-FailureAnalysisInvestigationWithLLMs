WestJet Airlines Ltd. could be heading toward its first loss after 31 profitable quarters after customer traffic on the company's flights dropped dramatically in November because of problems with its computerized booking system, two analysts said yesterday.
"Based on our new forecast, we now expect WestJet to report a loss in Q4," wrote Dlouhy Merchant analyst Cameron Doerksen. "Since the company has strung together 31 consecutive quarters to profitability, a reported loss will likely be a psychological blow for the stock."
WestJet said its load factor, or the percentage of available seats that are occupied on a flight, fell to 58.5% in November from 64.1% in the same period a year earlier. The company's load factor until November was 69.5%, down from 70.3% in 2003.
WestJet stock fell 2% to close at $12.60 on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday.
In a news release, WestJet chief executive Clive Beddoe said the drop in customer traffic was due to problems within the company's computerized booking system.
The booking system would not always display the best prices available, Mr. Beddoe said, and "as a result, many potential guests did not book with WestJet.
"Our November load factor was disappointingly low due in large part to a series of computer system failures involving our revenue and inventory management systems," he said. "At times, these failures prevented us from adjusting our fares quickly and displaying our seat inventory accurately."
Mr. Beddoe said that even though "significant aspects" of the company's computer system have been replaced, there are still issues that need to be resolved.
Jacques Kavafian, an analyst with Research Capital Corp., also felt WestJet may be facing a loss in its fourth quarter, although he added the company might still break even.
"This is a very serious problem for WestJet," he said, adding the company's business problems are "an aberration."
Mr. Kavafian said WestJet's explanation for the traffic shortfall appeared legitimate.
"This drop was too substantial to be competition," he said. "It is obvious that something happened in this month."
The customer traffic issue is the latest business problem for WestJet, which is being sued by rival Air Canada over an alleged case of corporate espionage. Installation of personal televisions in the company's jets has also been behind schedule.
WestJet's results contrasted strongly with Air Canada, which reported a load factor of 74.6% for the month, its highest total ever for the period, compared with 69.2% in November, 2003.
"What is so remarkable is that these numbers are in such stark contrast," said Douglas Reid, professor of strategy at Queen's School of Business.
"They remind me of the movie Trading Places.
"WestJet's expansion may have been too much, too soon, to the point where we are talking about this company and loss in the same breath."
One industry insider suggested WestJet's expansion into flights from Toronto to Montreal and Ottawa were performing badly and hurting the company's load factor.
Some analysts felt that a renewed Air Canada could be cutting into WestJet's traffic.
"We continue to believe the drop in load factor reflects a more competitive environment, WestJet's focus on trying to improve its yield [average fare], and its expansion into new markets such as the Canada-U.S. market," wrote BMO Nesbitt Burns analyst Claude Proulx in a research note.
