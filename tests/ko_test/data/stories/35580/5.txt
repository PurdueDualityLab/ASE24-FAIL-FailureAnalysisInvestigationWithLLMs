Movie toys for men, boys and everyone else, for that matter

MEN WORK so they can buy toys.
By toys, you might think plasma TVs, digital camcorders and cell phones that come when you whistle.
And you would be right.
But you would overlook simpler toys and toylike things that not only are fun to look at and play with -- we're all kids at heart -- but make great conversation pieces and, depending on a variety of factors, valuable collectibles.
Just mull these words: "Star Wars."
If you were among the forward-thinking obsessive-compulsive types who hoarded paraphernalia from the first three Luke-and-Leia movies - - and kept them in the original packaging -- you can probably afford a condo in Maui.
Of course, while C-3PO, the various starships and alien action figures look good in their boxes, they take up a lot of space.
If you want them to hold their value, you can't risk taking them out of the cardboard-and-plastic containers to mess with them.
If you want to have fun with them, you have to ignore all that and just get what appeals to you or to the giftee. Movie memorabilia is a treat for film fanatics, kids and anyone who enjoys offbeat toys.
Just think of the show-and-tell possibilities when you bring out Mr. Potato Head Darth Tater. It's an engaging bit of nonsense even "Star Wars" enthusiasts should appreciate.
Unveil it at a small gathering and let everyone play with the parts.
And, no, like Barbie's Ken, Darth Tater is not anatomically correct.
It retails for about $8 and is recommended for ages 2 and up, which is why I got one for myself.
A great treat for people who love things that move and make sounds is the King Kong: Action Figure -- Supreme Kong.
Patterned after Peter Jackson's "King Kong," the big ape is 14 inches tall and roars as it moves its arms up and down. (Batteries are included.)
When you position the arms and legs right, Kong walks on all fours.
Because of a design glitch, though, the walking often turns into a face-first sprawl. But since this is the mighty Kong, it's amusing and that's the point.
Kong carries a hefty $37.99 price tag, but compared with the price of a plasma TV, that's nickels and dimes.
(A bonus: It's a marvelous distraction when you're on deadline.)
Another plus about movie memorabilia: Whenever you look at it, it reminds you of the feelings you had when you watched the film.
An example is this year's "Wallace & Gromit: Curse of the Wererabbit" four-figure sets. There are two. The most engaging is in the accompanying photo.
I bought the set at Tower Records for $12.95, and the characters make me grin every time I notice them.
Another positive: They take up little space.
As for the collectible thing, a lot of the good stuff -- "good" being in the eye of the beholder -- is surprisingly affordable.
I found a rubber Mr. Sta-Puff Marshmallow Man, from "Ghostbusters," at an antique store in Martinez for $13. I picked up a second at a flea market for $10. (You can never have too many.)
And I got a tiny R2-D2 filled with sweets and selling at Skywalker Sound a few years ago for about $7. Can't beat that for a quick pick-me-up.
My "Fargo" snow globe is not pictured, but it's also something I cherish. It features an overturned car and the sheriff, on her knees in the snow, looking at a dead body.
It came with a limited-edition version of the DVD. I've been offered $35 for it. It's not for sale. The conversation value is priceless.
These things are out there. Just keep your eyes open. And peruse eBay.
DVD spotlight ... Now that you're aware of "King Kong," which opens Wednesday, you might want to find out more about the three- hour extravaganza, for your own growth and to impress your friends after the screening.
If so, take a look at "King Kong: Peter Jackson's Production Diaries" ($39.98 retail, but you can do better).
Due out Tuesday, the package is designed like a square briefcase with latches -- evidently everything related to "Kong" must be big. Highlighting the set are two DVDs that split the Oscar-winning filmmaker's eight-month production slate into 54 diaries (can you stand it?) and include interviews with stars and behind-the-scenes this and that.
The box also contains a 50-page color booklet filled with on-set and behind-the-scenes photos and drawings; four conceptual lithographs (one of which is pretty slick) created for this collection, as well as a numbered letter of authenticity. Don't get too excited; the number on an early set is
255,093, so there are more than a few dozen out there.
There's also a detailed look at the Kong vs. T-Rex battle scene.
Running time is 3 hours, 46 minutes.
Might make a nice gift. But for whom? And if it's for someone in the house, would that person make you sit and watch all three-plus hours?
So many factors, so little time.
