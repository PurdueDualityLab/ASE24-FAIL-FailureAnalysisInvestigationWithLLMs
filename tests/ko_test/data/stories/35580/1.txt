Here's some advice to game- development companies looking to make movie to video game conversions: play King Kong and see how it's done.
From the first moments, as you are lowered into a row boat from the ship Venture, a fierce storm clouding the sky and stirring up the water around Skull Island, you can see the high production values at work on King Kong. And they continue until the end.
I first saw footage of the game at this year's E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo), during a private screening, and was impressed. After playing it, I'm still impressed. The visuals do a nice job of recreating Skull Island, inhabited by giant millipedes, dinosaurs, scorpions, strange natives and, of course, the mighty King Kong himself.
Joining you are Carl Denham, a film director, and onscreen heroine Ann Darrow. Gameplay is a mix of about 70 per cent in first- person mode as Driscoll and about 30% as Kong himself.
Probably the first thing you'll notice is the lack of a heads-up display. The screen is devoid of ammunition counters, health bars, damage meters or anything else. When you're injured, the screen turns a faint blood red and you hear your heart beat faster and your movements become slower. You press the B button to find out how much ammunition you have, eliciting a "two clips on backup" or "almost dry" response from your character.
You won't find health packs hiding behind trees, or ammunition sitting on rocks either. Occasionally, you'll find crates that have been dropped from a plane from the Venture, but the ammo won't last long and you'll have to use the environment to defend yourself: often spears and bones from dead creatures that can be thrown. It's another step in creating a more immersive game.
Playing Kong is an exciting break from the first-person sequences, and there is a feeling of invincibility as you tackle V- Rex dinosaurs and flying creatures. These sequences, though, don't last long and it would have been nicer to play Kong a bit more.
King Kong won't take you that long to finish -- it's extremely linear -- and I experienced a couple of AI glitches (one where a dinosaur got stuck on a repeating running cycle on a cliff top), but the game is a masterpiece, from start to finish. Other developers take note. --Gerard Campbell
