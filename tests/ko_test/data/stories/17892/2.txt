An embarrassing computer glitch at British Airways contributed to a #20m nosedive in passenger traffic last month. A fault in British Airways' mainframe computer in March led to the delay of hundreds of flights after its reservation system crashed.
BA check-in staff around the world, unable to access some bookings, had to resort to manual procedures for those passengers affected.
A spokeswoman for BA yesterday said the computer problem had also affected staff selling tickets and booking reservations on flights.
This contributed to passenger traffic in March falling 8.9 per cent below the figure for the same month last year.
The spokeswoman also blamed the impact of the foot and mouth disease and the slowing US economy for a drop in the number of tourists choosing to fly BA.
Premium traffic fell by three per cent while non-premium traffic dropped by 10.1per cent.
BA said the overall effect of the drop on revenue in the month was between #15m to #20m. The airline added the computer problem is expected to have some impact on its figures for both April and May as its booking system was affected for a 10-day period.
British Airways has been reducing its capacity to focus on improving the service, particularly in its business class, where flat beds have been recently introduced on a number of flights.
The spokeswoman said this reduction had also impacted the passenger traffic figures.
The airline's Club World business class was the one bright spot in March.
BA said that it had continued to grow despite coming up against a strong comparable performance last year.
"The outlook for this cabin continues to be positive," it added.
