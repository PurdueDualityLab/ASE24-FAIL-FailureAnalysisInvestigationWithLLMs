An embarrassing computer glitch that caused fury and frustrations for air passengers on the Newcastle-London route has been a major cause of a 20m nosedive in passenger traffic revenues for British Airways.A fault in the airline's mainframe computer last month led to the delay of hundreds of flights throughout the country and abroad after its reservation system crashed. BA check-in staff around the world, unable to access some bookings, had to resort to manual procedures for those passengers affected.A BA spokeswoman said yesterday the computer problem had also affected staff selling tickets and booking reservations on flights.Waits of an hour and longer in queues were often reported.With all this, passenger traffic in March fell 8.9pc below the figure for the same month last year.But the impact of the foot-and-mouth disease and the slowing US economy are also being blamed for a drop in the number of tourists choosing to fly BA. Premium traffic fell by 3pc while non-premium traffic dropped by 10.1pc.Overall effect of the drop on revenue in the month was between 15m and 20m.The computer problem is also expected to impact on its figures for April and May as its booking system was affected for a 10-day period.BA has been reducing its capacity to focus on improving service, particularly in its business class, where flat beds now feature on some flights.The spokeswoman said this reduction had also impacted the passenger traffic figures.BA's Club World business class was the one bright spot in March, continuing to grow despite coming up against a strong comparable performance last year.
