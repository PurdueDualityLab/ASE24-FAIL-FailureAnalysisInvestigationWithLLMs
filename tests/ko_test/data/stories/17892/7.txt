AN EMBARRASSING computer glitch at British Airways contributed to a GBP 20 million nosedive in passenger traffic last month.
A fault in British Airways' mainframe computer last month led to the delay of hundreds of flights after its reservation system crashed.
BA check-in staff around the world, unable to access some bookings, had to resort to manual procedures for those passengers affected.
A spokeswoman for BA said the computer problem had also affected staff selling tickets and booking reservations.
This contributed to passenger traffic in March falling 8.9 per cent, below the figure for the same month last year.
The impact of the foot-and-mouth disease and the slowing US economy were also blamed for a drop in the number of tourists choosing to fly BA.
Premium traffic fell by three per cent while non-premium traffic dropped by 10.1 per cent.
BA said the overall effect of the drop on revenue in the month was between GBP 15 million to pounds 20 million.
The airline added the computer problem is expected to have some impact on its figures for both April and May, as its booking system was affected for a 10-day period. BA has been reducing its capacity to focus on improving service, which had also had an impact on passenger traffic figures.
BA's Club World business class was the one bright spot in March. The airline said it had continued to grow despite coming up against a strong comparable performance last year.
