An embarrassing computer glitch at British Airways contributed to 20 million nosedive in passenger traffic numbers last month, the airline said today.
A fault in British Airways' mainframe computer last month led to the delay of hundreds of flights after its reservation system crashed.
BA check-in staff around the world, unable to access some bookings, had to resort to manual procedures for those passengers affected.
A spokeswoman for BA today said the computer problem had also affected staff selling tickets and booking reservations on flights.
This contributed to passenger traffic in March falling 8.9% below the figure for the same month last year.
The spokeswoman also blamed the impact of the foot-and-mouth disease and the slowing US economy for a drop in the number of tourists choosing to fly BA.
Premium traffic fell by 3% while non-premium traffic dropped by 10.1%.
BA said the overall effect of the drop on revenue in the month was between 15 million to 20 million.
The airline added the computer problem is expected to have some impact on its figures for both April and May as its booking system was affected for a 10-day period.
BA has been reducing its capacity to focus on improving service, particularly in its business class, where flat beds have been introduced on a number of flights.
The spokeswoman said this reduction had also impacted the passenger traffic figures.
BA's Club World business class was the one bright spot in March. The airline said it had continued to grow despite coming up against a strong comparable performance last year.
'The outlook for this cabin continues to be positive,' it added.
