The combination of the US economic slowdown, a computer glitch in its booking system and the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease cost British Airways up to #20m in lost revenue last month. The news came as the airline revealed that traffic in March fell almost 9 per cent compared with the same period last year.
The fall in passengers was significantly ahead of the airline's reduction in capacity of 6.6 per cent year-on-year.
BA said it could not quantify the impact of each of the three factors. "When passengers cancel their bookings they do not tell us the reason."
The US downturn was expected to hit BA harder than most of its continental European rivals. The UK carrier is the largest airline on the North Atlantic and derives almost all its profits from these routes. Last year, those profits offset the large losses the airline incurred in its European operations.
BA said the introduction of its flat-beds in Club World, the business class cabin on intercontinental flights, had helped offset the North Atlantic decline. The success of the beds meant Club World traffic continued to grow in March, although overall business and first class traffic fell 3 per cent.
BA said the effects of a computer failure last month was expected to have a negative impact on traffic in April and May.
BA lost customers during the 10-day period when its key reservation system was plagued with partial failures. At times, it left the airline unable to take new bookings or access reservations from some locations, leading to the delay of hundreds of flights.
The problem started after routine maintenance that caused some of the links to the mainframe to crash.
The airline said it had no more than anecdotal evidence that the foot-and-mouth outbreak in the UK was detering tourists from visiting the UK.
