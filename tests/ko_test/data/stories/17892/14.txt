British Airways revealed yesterday that it lost up to pounds 20m last month in passenger traffic numbers due to a computer failure which disrupted the flights of thousands of people over several days.
BA's reservations system crashed after a fault was discovered in the company's mainframe computer. It meant that BA's check-in staff worldwide had to resort to manual procedures.
A BA spokeswoman said that the computer problem had also affected staff selling tick ets and booking reservations on flights. They contributed to passenger traffic in March falling 8.9% below the figure for the same month last year.
She also blamed the foot and mouth crisis and the slowdown of the American economy for a drop in the number of tourists choosing to fly BA.
Premium traffic fell by 3%, while non-premium traffic dropped 10.1%. BA said that the overall effect of the drop in revenue was between pounds 15m and pounds 20m.
The airline said that the computer problem was expected to have some impact on its fig ures for both April and May because its booking period was affected for a 10-day period.
BA has been reducing capacity to focus on improving service in its business class, where flat beds are being gradually introduced on its North American flights.
Capacity in March was 6.6% down on the previous year.
BA has begun trialling a portable computer queue buster. Check-in agents based at Heathrow's Terminal 4 have donned cyber-style equipment which enables them to rove the terminals to carry out on the spot check-ins.
