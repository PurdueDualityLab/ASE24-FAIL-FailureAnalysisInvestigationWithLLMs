AN embarrassing computer glitch at British Airways contributed to pounds 20 million nosedive in passenger traffic last month, the airline said yesterday.
A fault in British Airways' mainframe computer last month led to the delay of hundreds of flights after its reservation system crashed.
BA check-in staff around the world, unable to access some bookings, had to resort to manual procedures for those passengers affected.
A spokeswoman for BA today said the computer problem had also affected staff selling tickets and booking reservations on flights. This contributed to passenger traffic in March falling 8.9% below the figure for the same month last year.
The spokeswoman also blamed the impact of the foot-and-mouth disease and the slowing US economy for a drop in the number of tourists flying BA.
