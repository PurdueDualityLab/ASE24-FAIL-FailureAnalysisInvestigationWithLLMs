A computer glitch at British Airways (BA) apparently resulted in the loss of some GBP20m during March.
The problem in the carrier's mainframe computer caused hundreds of flights to be delayed when the reservations system crashed. BA staff were forced to conduct manual check-in procedures and the problem also affected staff selling tickets and making booking reservations according to PA News. In all, the ten-day glitch resulted in March passenger traffic falling by 8.9% compared to the same month in 2000. Premium traffic fell by 3% and non-premium by 10.1%.
A spokesperson for the carrier also blamed the low passenger numbers on the foot and mouth disease scare and the slowing US economy. Further, the carrier says that a deliberate reduction in capacity has resulted in falling passenger traffic.
The computer glitch is also expected to affect passenger numbers in April and May.
