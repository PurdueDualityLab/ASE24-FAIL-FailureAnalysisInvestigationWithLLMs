A COMPUTER breakdown helped to blow a #20 million hole in British Airways' income last month and will lead to reduced bookings until the end of May.
The airline said that passenger numbers fell by 8.9 per cent last month, partly because of the crash which affected the company's computer reservation system for ten days in March.
Tens of thousands of bookings are believed to have been lost during the computer collapse, which also caused flight delays and cancellations during the second and third weeks of March.
British Airways admitted that the knock-on effect on bookings would affect sales throughout April and May but refused to put a number on the losses it expects to incur as a result of the computer malfunction.
The economic slowdown in the US and the effects of foot-and-mouth disease on visitor numbers also contributed to the drop in passenger numbers, which was greater than during February.
However, BA's share price rose 15p to the highest level for a month, at 349p, as the airline pointed to the success of its business class Club World service, which saw passenger volumes increase.
The surprise cut in US interest rates also helped BA's share price, as analysts predicted that the fall in transatlantic traffic would be less pronounced than expected.
The proportion of seats sold on BA flights fell 1.8 per cent to 70 per cent. But BA insisted that its strategy of cutting capacity on US routes would enable it to withstand the slowdown better than rivals.
