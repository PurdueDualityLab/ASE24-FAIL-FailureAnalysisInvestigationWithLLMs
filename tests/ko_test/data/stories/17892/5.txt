Computer fault hits BA AN embarrassing computer glitch at British Airways contributed to a #20 million nosedive in passenger traffic last month, the airline said yesterday. A fault in British Airways' mainframe computer last month led to the delay of hundreds of flights after its reservation system crashed. BA check-in staff around the world, unable to access some bookings, had to resort to manual procedures for those passengers affected. The airline added that the computer problem is expected to have some impact on its figures for both April and May as its booking system was affected for a ten-day period.
