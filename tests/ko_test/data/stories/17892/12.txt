BRITISH Airways suffered a 20million drop in revenue last month after a computer crash hit its check-in desks and reservations system.
Hundreds of flights were delayed and about eight cancelled over ten days after BA staff worldwide had to check in passengers manually.
The glitch traced to a fault in BA's mainframe computer also stopped its reservation system from confirming bookings. Air Miles were mislaid as well.
The number of passengers carrieddropped to 2.9million in March compared to 3.1million in the same month last year, a fall of 8.9 per cent.
As a result, revenue fell by between 15mil-lion and 20million, said BA.
The airline said foot-and-mouth and the slowing U.S. economy also had an effect.
A computer problem in November last year caused a day of disruption to BA services in and out of Heathrow.
A BA spokesman said: 'The problem has been sorted out now.'
