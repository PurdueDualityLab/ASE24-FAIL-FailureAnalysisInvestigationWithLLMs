After months of delay to work out technical glitches, Madison on Wednesday launched the first of 100 multi-space parking meters Downtown that will take credit cards, debit cards or coins.
The first two multi-space meters replaced 54 single-pole meters Wednesday at the city's Buckeye parking lot near the corner of State and Gorham streets.
"The new meters will improve convenience and ease for visitors to our Downtown," Mayor Dave Cieslewicz said in a statement. "Because of their popularity, I've included funding for more multi-space meters in my 2011 capital budget."
The city will put 13 more multi-space meters, which cost $8,100 apiece, into service around Capitol Square in coming weeks, replacing another 150 pole meters, Parking Operations manager Bill Knobeloch said.
As the meters become operational, city "ambassadors" will help customers during busy hours between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.
Cieslewicz has proposed spending $567,000 for 70 more meters in 2011 and $122,000 for 15 more in 2012. All told, the 100 new meters will replace more than 800 pole meters, or about half of all meters in the city, Knobeloch said.
All of the new meters, except for the two at Brayton lot, are solar powered, he said.
The city will boost the cost of parking by 20 cents an hour - many meters increasing from $1.50 to $1.70 hourly - for multi-space meters.
Over time, Knobeloch hopes the city will replace all pole meters.
