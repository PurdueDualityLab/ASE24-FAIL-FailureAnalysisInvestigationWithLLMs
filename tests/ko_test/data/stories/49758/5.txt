New meters pour water on BMC hope

MUMBAI: A new problem has cropped up for the BMC, which is already at its wits' end trying to figure out ways to tackle the city's water shortage.
A latest survey of newly imported water meters, installed on a pilot basis across the city, has found that as many as 1,319 of them are faulty. These automatic meter reading (AMR) instruments, which are imported from Israel and France, allow officials to take down the figures even from a distance.
The study reveals that 414 of the new meters have completely stopped working and 892 more, installed just a few months ago, have been showing figures that are 50% below the actual consumption. Thirteen more were giving erratic reading, officials said.
The AMR is the technology with the help of which the consumption, diagnostic and status data can be collected from meters automatically and then the details can be transferred to a central database for billing. The advantage of the AMR is that it allows billing based on almost real-time consumption rather than depending on previous or predicted readings.
Under the pilot project, which was started last year, 9,000 water meters were supposed to be installed, of which, the BMC has set up 6,046 instruments so far. Once the pilot project gets over, the civic body plans to invite a Rs 750-crore tender to instal AMR meters by 2011. 'The project is supposed to begin in February and completed in the next one year,'' said additional municipal commissioner Anil Diggikar.
However now, the news of faulty meters has come as a blow to officials who hoped that the new instruments would record all kinds of tampering, thereby reducing theft and leakages. The civic officials will first have to repair the defunct meters before they can go ahead with their plan. For that, an official said, they would have to zero in on the actual snags, inform the technical committee about it and request it to blacklist the contractors, said a senior civic official.
Last year, the AMR meters were cleared by a technical committee, which included experts from IIT. Soon after, the pilot project was carried out by three selected firms, Actoris, Sappel and Arad. However, while Actoris and Arad successfully supplied and maintained their instruments, many of the meters manufactured by Sappel were found to be faulty.
Municipal commissioner Swadheen Kshatriya said in spite of the glitches, the BMC was still 'very excited'' about the project. 'It will take time to repair the snags. Once that is achieved, we are sure that the AMR meters will be of great use,'' he said.
Each AMR meter costs something between Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000. Currently, the city has 3.27 lakh metered connections, but some of the Indian-made meters are plastic, which makes tampering easy.
