Microsoft's HotMail subsidiary is scrambling to fix a security glitch in its free e-mail service that could allow someone to steal passwords from HotMail members, a representative at the company's public relations company said Tuesday.
The security breach was uncovered Monday by a Web developer at Canadian company Specialty Installations, which has posted an explanation of it on the company's "Because-We-Can" Web page (at http://www.because-we-can.com/hotmail/default.htm)[http://www.because-we-can.com/hotmail/default.htm)].
The scheme involves sending an e-mail message to a HotMail user that contains a particular JavaScript program. When users open their e-mail, the JavaScript program runs almost instantly, creating a message box that tells users their account access has timed out and asking them to re-enter their log-in information.
In doing so, the victim's username and password are sent back to the person who sent the malicious e-mail. Armed with that information, the intruder could delete, send, and read the victim's e-mail, access the victim's address book, and check messages on other mail servers the victim may have configured to be accessible from the HotMail account, according to Specialty Installations.
"HotMail is working right now on a permanent fix ... They're working flat out," said Peter Ross, a spokesman for HotMail's public relations company. HotMail cannot say at the moment how long it will take to implement the fix, he added.
As a temporary measure, HotMail users can disable the JavaScript support in their browser software, Specialty Installations advised.
HotMail Corp., in Sunnyvale, Calif., can be reached at (408) 222-7000 or http://www.hotmail.com[http://www.hotmail.com]. Specialty Installations Ltd. can be reached at http://www.specialty.ab.ca[http://www.specialty.ab.ca].
