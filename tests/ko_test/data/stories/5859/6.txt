Web mail may be open to password attack

Millions of Web-based e-mail accounts could be vulnerable to intrusions such as that demonstrated Monday on Hotmail accounts, an expert said Tuesday.
That question became very real Monday when a Canadian Web programmer uncovered a security glitch that would allow a malicious user to steal the passwords from Hotmail accounts.
"This is fairly powerful," said Web programmer Tom Cervenka, who created the password-stealing exploit. "It changes the links in both of the frames on the [Hotmail user interface] page. ... Who's to say that with a little work, someone couldn't write a program far more subtle and dangerous?"
He said the exploit would need only minor modifications to run on any Web-based e-mail service that accepts JavaScript code.
Many popular sites, such as Excite, Yahoo!, Netcenter and Lycos, offer free, Web-based e-mail from such providers as Four11, a subsidiary of Yahoo! Inc.; WhoWhere?, a division of Lycos Inc.; USA.net Inc.; and iName, a division of GlobeComm Inc.
Those providers were not immediately available to give details on their response to the security flaw.
Difficult to stop
One of the reasons the exploit is difficult to stop is because it is so simple: All it uses is a few lines of JavaScript, a programming language used to enhance Web pages.
Created by Cervenka, of Canadian Specialty Installations, an Alberta-based network reseller, the exploit alters the Hotmail user interface, which is comprised of ordinary HTML pages.
The next time the user clicks on any link in the interface, he is directed to a false timeout message, asking him to enter his password to log in to Hotmail.
Once the user enters his password, he returns to the ordinary Hotmail interface -- but the password is e-mailed to a malicious user. In the case of a demonstration posted on the site because-we-can.com, the password is mailed to Specialty Installations.
Hotmail acknowledged the glitch Monday evening and posted a temporary fix -- a server-side filter that simply removes JavaScript from incoming messages.
However, Cervenka found it simple to get around the temporary fix, by enclosing the malicious code within a different set of HTML tags -- tags the filter did not recognize.
Hotmail says it is working on a permanent solution to any JavaScript security breaches, but as of Tuesday afternoon had not produced a long-term fix.
Hotmail 'confident' of a solution
"We continue to work extremely diligently and hard in terms of a completely robust and completely audited solution," said Sean Fee, director of product marketing for Hotmail.
He said he is confident a fix will be found soon.
Part of the draw of Web-based e-mail services is their ability to display anything a Web browser can display, since they use the browser itself as the mail viewer.
Hotmail says it eventually wants to reach a solution in which users can view JavaScript without any security risk.
"In the long term, what we'd like to move toward is a mechanism where it allows the functionality of scripting back into the messages, in such a way that it is completely safe and not malicious," Fee said.
Tips for avoiding vulnerability
Hotmail and Cervenka recommend several steps to avoid the vulnerability:
Don't open messages from unknown parties.
If you see an unexpected password prompt, do not use it to log on to your account; instead, return to the account by typing the Hotmail URL into your browser, or using a bookmark.
Turn off JavaScript capabilities on your browser while using Hotmail, until a permanent solution is put into place.
Hotmail, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., has 22 million active users.
