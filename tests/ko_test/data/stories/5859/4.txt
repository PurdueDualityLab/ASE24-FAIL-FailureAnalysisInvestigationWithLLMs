Microsoft Corp.'s HotMail subsidiary is scrambling to fix a security glitch in its free e-mail service that could allow someone to steal passwords from HotMail members, a company spokesman said.
The security breech was uncovered Monday by a Web developer at Canadian firm Specialty Installations.
The scheme involves sending an e-mail message to a HotMail user that contains a particular JavaScript program. When the user opens the e-mail the JavaScript program starts running almost instantly, and creates a message box that tells the user their account access has timed out, and asks them to reenter their log-in information.
In doing so, the victim's username and password are winged back to the person who sent the malicious e-mail. Armed with that information, the intruder could delete, send and read the victim's e-mail, access the victim's address book, and check messages on other mail servers the victim may have configured to be accessable from the HotMail account, according to Specialty Installations.
"HotMail is working right now on a permanent fix... They're working flat out," said Peter Ross, a HotMail spokesman. HotMail cannot say at the moment how long it will take to implement the fix, he added.
As a temporary measure, HotMail users can disable the JavaScript support in their browser software, Specialty Installations advised.
