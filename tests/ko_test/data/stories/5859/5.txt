Hotmail posts fix to password flaw

Microsoft Corp.'s Hotmail subsidiary says it has fixed a security glitch that would allow users to steal Hotmail members' passwords.
On Monday, Canadian Web programmers publicized how malicious users could fool Hotmail users into revealing their passwords, using nothing more elaborate than JavaScript code attached to an e-mail message. The code, which runs as soon as the e-mail message is viewed, alters the Web-based user interface of the Hotmail e-mail account, creating a false timeout message, and asking users to re-enter their passwords in order to use the account.
Once Hotmail users re-enter their passwords, they would return to the normal Hotmail interface -- but by then, their password security would have been compromised.
Canadian Specialty Installations, a reseller, posted a demonstration of the exploit, which it calls "Hot" Mail, on the Web site "Because-we-can," which publishes the work of Specialty Installations Web programmers.
Hotmail acknowledged the vulnerability Monday evening. The company has posted a server-side fix, and says it will shortly produce a "permanent fix" to "similar problems."
"Hotmail is committed to protecting its members and their accounts and takes even the smallest e-mail security risk very seriously," Hotmail said in a statement.
Steps to safety
The e-mail service recommends several steps to avoid the vulnerability:
Don't open messages from unknown parties.
If you see an unexpected password prompt, do not use it to log on to your account; instead, return to the account by typing the Hotmail URL into your browser, or using a bookmark.
Specialty Installations recommends users turn off JavaScript capabilities on their browsers while using Hotmail, until a permanent solution is put into place.
"The security problem is easy to take advantage of," said the programmers in a message posted on because-we-can.com. "A would-be hacker needs only to embed the JavaScript code into the body of an e-mail message using a standard e-mail program such as Netscape Mail."
Damage potential is out there
Once a user has someone's password, he or she can not only alter that Hotmail account, but can also alter or delete messages on an Internet service provider e-mail account, through the POP-mail feature on Hotmail.
The glitch works on any JavaScript-enabled browser, according to Specialty Installations.
Hotmail, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., has 22 million active users.
