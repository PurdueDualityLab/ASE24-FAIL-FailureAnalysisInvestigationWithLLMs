Continued cost controls helped 3Com Corp. top analysts' expectations for second-quarter earnings despite declining revenue.
3Com, Santa Clara, California, reported net income of $177.1 million (175 million euros), or 51 cents a diluted share, for the three months ended Nov. 26, compared with net income of $132.9 million, or 36 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier.
The bottom line was swelled by a $71.3 million gain from the sale of investments. Excluding one-time gains and charges, 3Com said it would have earned $130.9 million, or 37 cents a share, compared with $133.4 million, or 36 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected earnings of 34 cents a share, excluding charges. It was the second consecutive quarter in which 3Com significantly topped analysts' expectations, following several years of inconsistent financial performance.
But the cost-control efforts masked continued revenue declines for the second-largest maker of computer-networking equipment. Revenue fell 4% to $1.47 billion, from $1.54 billion in the year-earlier period. Excluding the Palm Computing division that 3Com plans to spin off next year, revenue declined 13% compared to the year-earlier period.
3Com released its results after stock markets closed. 3Com shares rose $4.25 to $53.125, their highest level in more than two years. Buoyed by the recent stability and the plans to spin off Palm, 3Com shares have more than doubled since they sank below $23 in early August. In after-hours trading, however, 3Com shares retreated to $49, according to Instinet.
The recent improvement in 3Com's fortunes is due entirely to efforts to streamline operations and control costs. Inventories are down, and 3Com's cash hoard has grown more than 61%, to $2.9 billion since May. "We're not through with our work," 3Com Chief Executive Eric Benhamou told analysts. "But we have made significant progress."
The Palm division, which makes handheld organizers, remains the strongest part of the business. Palm sales grew 77% compared with the year-earlier period, to $261 million. 3Com last week filed for an initial public offering of Palm, and plans to sell the remainder of its stake later next year.
By contrast, the remainder of 3Com's business continues to struggle. Sales of computer-networking equipment fell 12%, compared to the year-earlier period. Sales of modems and adapter cards fell 14%. Mr. Benhamou blamed delays in introducing new products and slight slowdown in sales to businesses because of concerns about the year-2000 computer glitch.
Mr. Benhamou said sales of 3Com's newer products, including high-speed modems, home-networking devices and wireless gear, grew sharply, but remain a small portion of the total.
