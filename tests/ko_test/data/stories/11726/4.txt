3Com reported higher earnings than expected for its second fiscal quarter but the US networking equipment company warned net income for the third quarter, ending in February, might be lower than expected.
Third-quarter earnings, excluding special items, were now expected to be "comparable" to the same period a year ago, when 3Com earned 24 cents a share.
Wall Street analysts had projected third-quarter earnings of around 32 cents a share. The stock was nearly $4 off its closing price of $53{1/8} in after-hours trading.
For the second fiscal quarter, ended November 26, 3Com reported revenues of $1.48bn, a 4 per cent decline from the same period a year ago.
Net income, excluding special items, was $130.9m, or 37 cents a share, compared with $133.4m, or 36 cents a share, in the second quarter of fiscal 1999. Wall Street analysts had projected earnings of 34 cents a share.
Sales of devices used to link personal computers to the internet rose 15 per cent over the prior quarter to $620.9m. However, sales of network systems products used to build internet-style networks were down 12 per cent to $593.2m.
Eric Benhamou, chairman and chief executive, said delays in shipping new products had contributed to the earnings shortfall in the network systems sector.
In addition, large corporate companies had halted new purchases due to concerns about Y2K computer glitches, he said.
3Com is also facing fierce competition in the network systems segment from companies including Cisco Systems, Lucent and Nortel.
New markets on which 3Com is pinning its hopes for future revenue growth include running voice telephony over local office networks, voice calls via the internet, home networking , wireless access to the internet and very-high-speed internet access.
In each of these segments the company was making significant progress, Mr Benhamou said.
Overall, sales in these new segments rose by 47 per cent in the second quarter compared with the prior quarter, and would begin to make a material contribution to the company's financial results in the near future, he said.
3Com has announced plans to spin off its Palm subsidiary, which produces the popular Palm Pilot hand-held computer, early next year. Copyright Financial Times Limited 1999. All Rights Reserved.
