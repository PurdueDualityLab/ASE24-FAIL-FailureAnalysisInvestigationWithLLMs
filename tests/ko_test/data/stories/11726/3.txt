3Com Corp. shares tumbled 8.8 percent after the No. 2 maker of computer-networking equipment said fiscal third-quarter profit will miss forecasts as customers delay purchases because of Year 2000 concerns.
3Com fell $4.69, to $48.44, in trading of more than 40.2 million shares, making it the second-most active U.S. stock.
The company late Tuesday said second-quarter sales fell 4.3 percent as it failed to introduce new versions of products such as data-traffic switches. Now, 3Com is warning that customers may further delay buying as they wait to assess the effect of Y2K computer glitches.
"The Y2K issues out there are a concern for everybody," said Matthew Barzowskas, an analyst at First Albany Corp., who rates 3Com shares a "neutral." 3Com "saw kind of a slowdown in orders because of Y2K."
Cisco Systems Inc., the No. 1 maker of Internet equipment, has said it expects sales growth to slow in its quarter ending in January as companies and government agencies wait to buy new equipment until next year.
Cisco's sales, though, will rise about 41 percent in the same quarter, according to a First Call/Thomson Financial poll of nine analysts. That compares with a 49 percent jump in the quarter ending in October.
3Com's sales and profit in the third quarter ending in February will be "comparable" to the year-earlier quarter, Chief Financial Officer Chris Paisley said in a conference call Tuesday.
Third-quarter profit had been forecast to rise to 32 cents a share from 24 cents in the year-earlier period, according to analysts.
3Com's warning comes as the company prepares to spin off its Palm Inc. unit, the No. 1 maker of electronic organizers and 3Com's fastest-growing business, to focus on networking equipment. Palm sales climbed 77 percent in the second quarter, 3Com's only business to rise from a year ago.
During the second quarter, Palm sales accounted for $260.9 million, or 18 percent, of 3Com's $1.47 billion in revenue.
"What they're spinning off is the crown jewel, from a revenue- growth standpoint," said analyst Martin Pyykkonen of CIBC World Markets. "You still have to figure out how to invest in the product line in the future."
Profit from operations in the period ended Nov. 26 fell to $130.9 million from $133.4 million a year ago.
