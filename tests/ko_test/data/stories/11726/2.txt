3Com Corp. topped analysts' expectations for fiscal second-quarter earnings, but triggered an after-hours sell-off by warning of sluggish growth and disappointing earnings in the months ahead.
Shares of the Santa Clara, California, maker of computer-networking equipment fell 14% to $45.875 in after-hours trading Tuesday. Earlier that day, 3Com had been up $4.25 to $53.125, its highest level in more than two years, in late-day trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. In late morning trading Wednesday, the shares were down 14%, or $7.4375, at $45.6875.
Chris Paisley, 3Com's chief financial officer, told Wall Street analysts that earnings excluding one-time charges in 3Com's fiscal third quarter, ending in February, would likely be "comparable" with last year's results, when 3Com earned 24 cents a share. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had been expecting third-quarter earnings of 32 cents.
Mr. Paisley said 3Com expects third-quarter revenue to be roughly equal to last year's. Earlier, 3Com had told analysts it expected quarterly revenue to grow.
The comments obscured 3Com's 33% increase in net income for the second fiscal quarter, despite declining revenue. 3Com reported net income of $177.3 million, or 51 cents a diluted share, for the three months ended Nov. 26, compared with $132.9 million, or 36 cents a share, a year earlier.
The bottom line was swelled by a gain of $71.3 million from the one-time sale of investments, including real estate and a portion of 3Com's stake in Extreme Networks Inc., based in Cupertino, California, another maker of computer-networking gear.
Excluding one-time gains and charges, 3Com said it would have earned $130.9 million, or 37 cents a share, compared with $133.4 million, or 36 cents, a year earlier. Analysts had expected 34 cents.
The results reflected 3Com's efforts to streamline operations and control costs. Inventories are down, and 3Com's cash hoard has increased more than 61% to $2.9 billion since May. "We're not through with our work," Eric Benhamou, 3Com's chief executive, told analysts. "But we have made significant progress."
But revenue fell 4% to $1.47 billion from $1.54 billion a year earlier. Excluding the Palm Computing division, which 3Com plans to spin off next year, revenue fell 13% from a year earlier.
Sales of modems and adapter cards fell 14%. Sales of computer-networking equipment for businesses fell 12% from a year earlier, suggesting that 3Com is losing more ground to market leader Cisco Systems Inc. Operating profit for the division fell to $6 million, or 1% of sales. Christopher Stix, an analyst for SG Cowen, called the results "shockingly bad."
Mr. Benhamou blamed delays in introducing products and a slight slowdown in sales to businesses on concern about the year-2000 computer glitch.
