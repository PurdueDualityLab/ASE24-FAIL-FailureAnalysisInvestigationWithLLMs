3Com Corp. topped analysts' expectations for fiscal second-quarter earnings, but triggered an after-hours sell-off by warning of sluggish growth and disappointing earnings in the months ahead.
Shares of the Santa Clara, Calif., maker of computer-networking equipment fell 14% to $45.875 in after-hours trading. Earlier, 3Com was up $4.25 to $53.125, its highest level in more than two years, in 4 p.m. trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
Chris Paisley, 3Com's chief financial officer, told Wall Street analysts that earnings excluding one-time charges in 3Com's fiscal third quarter, ending in February, would likely be "comparable" with last year's results, when 3Com earned 24 cents a share. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had been expecting third-quarter earnings of 32 cents.
Mr. Paisley said 3Com expects thirdquarter revenue to be roughly equal to last year's. Earlier, 3Com had told analysts it expected quarterly revenue to grow.
The comments obscured 3Com's 33% increase in net income for the second fiscal quarter, despite declining revenue. 3Com reported net income of $177.3 million, or 51 cents a diluted share, for the three months ended Nov. 26, compared with $132.9 million, or 36 cents a share, a year earlier.
The bottom line was swelled by a gain of $71.3 million from the one-time sale of investments, including real estate and a portion of 3Com's stake in Extreme Networks Inc., Cupertino, Calif., another maker of computer-networking gear.
Excluding one-time gains and charges, 3Com said it would have earned $130.9 million, or 37 cents a share, compared with $133.4 million, or 36 cents, a year earlier. Analysts had expected 34 cents.
The results reflected 3Com's efforts to streamline operations and control costs. Inventories are down, and 3Com's cash hoard has increased more than 61% to $2.9 billion since May. "We're not through with our work," 3Com Chief Executive Eric Benhamou told analysts. "But we have made significant progress."
But revenue fell 4% to $1.47 billion from $1.54 billion a year earlier. Excluding the Palm Computing division, which 3Com plans to spin off next year, revenue fell 13% from a year earlier.
Sales of modems and adapter cards fell 14%. Sales of computer-networking equipment for businesses fell 12% from a year earlier, suggesting that 3Com is losing more ground to market leader Cisco Systems Inc. Operating profit for the division fell to $6 million, or 1% of sales. Christopher Stix, an analyst for SG Cowen, called the results "shockingly bad."
Mr. Benhamou blamed delays in introducing products and a slight slowdown in sales to businesses on concern about the year-2000 computer glitch.
Still, Mr. Benhamou said in an interview he was increasingly optimistic about 3Com in the long term. Sales of 3Com's newer products, including high-speed modems, home-networking devices and wireless gear, grew sharply but remain a small part of the total. "We don't expect this to be more than a short-term blip," he said.
The Palm division, which makes handheld organizers, remained a bright spot. Palm sales grew 77% from a year earlier to $261 million. 3Com last week filed for an initial public offering for Palm and plans to sell the rest of its stake later next year.
Separately, Mr. Paisley, 46 years old, said he will retire in the summer. Mr. Paisley, who has been 3Com's chief financial officer since 1985, is widely respected on Wall Street. No successor was named.
