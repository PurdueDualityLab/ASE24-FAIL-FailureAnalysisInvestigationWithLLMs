NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- 3Com Corp. shares tumbled Wednesday after the maker of computer-networking equipment warned analysts that it won't meet fiscal third-quarter earnings estimates because of a slowdown in technology spending by companies ahead of the year 2000 and increased competition from rivals.
3Com (COMS) shares fell $4.688, or 8.8%, to close at $48.438, on volume of 40.5 million, compared with average daily volume of 8.6 million.
Late Tuesday 3Com Chief Financial Officer Christopher Paisley, who plans to retire next summer, told analysts that earnings excluding one-time gains, charges and acquisition expenses would be "comparable" to year-ago results for the quarter ending in February. Year-ago earnings came to 24 cents a share. The mean estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial was for third-quarter earnings of 32 cents a share.
The Santa Clara, Calif.-based firm expects third-quarter revenue to be roughly equal to that of a year ago. Previously, 3Com had told analysts it expected to show revenue growth.
The company offered its outlook in a conference call following release of better-than-expected fiscal second quarter earnings. 3Com said net income came to $177.3 million, or 51 cents a share on a fully diluted basis, compared with $132.9 million, or 36 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
The latest results included $71.3 million in investment gains and a $5.9 million charge related to a corporate realignment. Excluding those items, the company said it would have posted earnings of $$130.9 million, or 37 cents a share. The mean estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial was for earnings of 34 cents per share.
The results reflected 3Com's efforts to streamline operations and control costs, The Wall Street Journal reported. Inventories fell and 3Com's cash hoard increased more than 61% since May to $2.9 billion. "We're not through with our work," 3Com Chief Executive Eric Benhamou told analysts. "But we have made significant progress."
Revenue, however, fell 4.3% to $1.47 billion. Excluding the Palm Computing Inc. division, which 3Com plans to spin off next year, revenue fell 13%.
Sales of modems and adapter cards fell 14%. Sales of computer-networking equipment for businesses fell 12% from a year earlier, suggesting that 3Com is losing more ground to market leader Cisco Systems Inc. Operating profit for the division fell to $6 million, or 1% of sales. Christopher Stix, an analyst for SG Cowen, called the results "shockingly bad."
Benhamou blamed delays in introducing products and a slight slowdown in sales to businesses on concern about the year-2000 computer glitch.
Still, Benhamou said in an interview with the Journal that he was increasingly optimistic about 3Com in the long term. Sales of 3Com's newer products, including high-speed modems, home-networking devices and wireless gear, grew sharply but remain a small part of the total. "We don't expect this to be more than a short-term blip," he said.
Separately, CMGI Inc.'s (CMGI) AltaVista Shopping.com Wednesday launched its AltaVista Shopping.com "Everywhere" shopping service for users of 3Com's Palm VII organizer.
CMGI said the free Internet application gives users wireless access to AltaVista Shopping.com's product and shopping research services, including comparative shopping data and merchant listings.
