FAMILIES IN MISERY AS DAWM PRIMAROLO IS SLAMMED OVER TREASURY BLUNDERS

20 times they told us it was correct... then they demanded Pounds 11,500 back!
A COUPLE told last night how the tax credit fiasco has plunged them into huge debt.
Factory worker Alistair Mitchell, 40, said: 'This has crippled my family. We got used to having the money each month and decided to have another baby.
'But while my wife was pregnant they realised that the payment was wrong and reduced the payment to 40 a month.
'We were so worried about not being able to provide for a second child that we nearly had the pregnancy terminated.'
Tony Blair yesterday apologised for the 'hardship and distress' caused to ALL the families left with huge bills after being overpaid tax credits.
The mistake could cost the Government 1BILLION in writing off the overpayments.
Alistair and his wife Catherine, 32, who have a daughter, Isobel, three, and a four-month-old son, James, agreed to speak exclusively to The Sun so long as we protected their identity.
The couple -whose names have been changed -were astonished when their tax credits jumped from 40 to 420 a month in 2003.
They repeatedly informed Inland Revenue officials that it seemed 'generous.'
But they were told that, because Catherine earned only 3,000 a year as a carer, they were entitled to the cash.
After being assured more than 20 TIMES that they were receiving the correct payments, the couple decided to have another child based on the additional money they were receiving.
Then, when Catherine was two months pregnant, they were devastated when the taxman demanded that they pay back a whopping 11,500.
Desperate Alistair, from Swindon, Wiltshire, contacted his MP, Conservative James Gray, who took up their case with the newly formed Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs.
After four months officials agreed that there had been a system glitch and agreed to wipe out the debt.
The error was caused by Revenue computers calculating the Child Tax Credit based on only Catherine's wage.
Yet since the birth of their son James, in February, the couple have struggled to live without the money they had got used to and have thousands of pounds of debts.
Alistair, who earns 20,000 a year, said: 'We have to put everything on credit cards now and have run up loads of debt. We have had no apology or real explanation about the fiasco.
'They don't seem to care that they are messing with hard-working people's lives.
'Why should honest, decent people be plunged into this sort of nightmare because of a Government bungle.
'The whole ordeal has left Catherine in such a depressed state she cannot even bring herself to talk about it.'
The extent of the fiasco was revealed yesterday by damning reports from Citizens Advice and a Government watchdog which have had to deal with thousands of cases.
They called for the crippling repayments to be cancelled. Paymaster General Dawn Primarolo was also slammed for not giving MPs a clear picture of the mounting crisis. Up to two million families have been affected -with 40,000 being overpaid by more than 5,000.
Parliamentary Ombudsman Ann Abraham described the system as 'harsh and unfair.'
She echoed CAB's call for an amnesty on the recovery of overpayments, particularly those caused by official errors in the first two years of the scheme.
Shambles
She said: 'This would be a sensible and proportionate response to the situation and would give much-needed relief to people who, in many cases, have been caused considerable distress and hardship.'
The shambles will come as a blow to Chancellor Gordon Brown's much-hyped Working Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit system.He said their aim was 'to make work pay,' eliminate family poverty and 'ensure that every child has the best start in life.'
He boasted: 'Everyone benefits. The more people in work, the less is paid out in social security, the better are the tax revenues and the better our ability to finance public services.'
Yesterday under-fire Dawn Primarolo told MPs she wanted debt repayments stopped until the fiasco had been sorted.
She said: 'I have asked the HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) where there is a dispute to consider suspending recovery of excess payments until the dispute is resolved.
'And where there is hardship I have asked them to ensure that additional payments are made.'
