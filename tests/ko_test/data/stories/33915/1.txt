Tax credit shambles is a Pounds 2bn write-off

NEARLY Pounds 2billion may have been wasted through the Government's shambolic tax credits system, a Whitehall watchdog reports today.
Parliamentary Ombudsman Ann Abraham has recommended that Pounds 1.9billion mistakenly paid out should be written off.
Almost two million families and single parents received an average of Pounds 1,000 more in refunded tax than they were entitled to last year because of computer glitches and the over- complicated way the payments are calculated.
They were then told the money had to be paid back to the Inland Revenue after most had already spent it.
In a strong attack on Gordon Brown's flagship policy, Miss Abraham said those affected 'have been caused considerable distress and hardship'.
She added: 'While it has benefited many millions of people, the tax credits system is currently operated in a way that can have unintended harsh and unfair consequences for vulnerable groups of people who will often have particular needs.' She said writing off the overpayments was a 'sensible and proportionate' response.
Although the Government does not have to accept the recommendations, the report will pile pressure on ministers.
The Chancellor introduced tax credits in 1998, with the aim of reducing child poverty and encouraging people to get back into work. But the system has been beset by chaos.
Delays in sending out payments left more than 400,000 struggling to make ends meet.
Shadow Chancellor George Osborne said: 'Gordon Brown owes an apology to millions of families in Britain. These reports reveal a catalogue of Government incompetence on a truly breathtaking scale.' A spokesman for HM Revenue and Customs, which has replaced the Inland Revenue, said it was already looking at writing off the overpayments.
