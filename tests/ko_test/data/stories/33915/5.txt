Write off tax credit errors, says watchdog

Pressure was mounting on the government last night to write off hundreds of millions of pounds worth of tax-credit cash mistakenly paid to families after a parliamentary watchdog sharply criticised the scheme.
Ann Abraham, the parliamentary ombudsman, said the tax credits system operated in a way that could have "unintended harsh and unfair consequences" for vulnerable people.
She called on officials to consider writing off all tax credit overpayments resulting from Inland Revenue errors since the system began two years ago - a move that would relieve many thousands of families from the hardship caused by demands for wrongly paid cash to be given back.
Opposition parties leapt on the findings, with the Conservatives claiming the report revealed a "catalogue of government incompetence on a truly breathtaking scale" and the Liberal Democrats urging the government to take Ms Abraham's advice and halt the clawing-back of overpayments resulting from official errors.
The tax credits scheme was introduced in April 2003, with the aim of encouraging low-income families to come off benefits and into work.
But it was beset with technical difficulties from the start, and the ombudsman said yesterday that despite the Revenue's assurances that these were just temporary glitches, the system continued to be plagued with problems, causing many people "considerable distress and hardship". Some had been threatened with eviction because of problems with their tax credit awards while others had been forced to borrow money, use up their savings or run up credit card debts to buy food and get to work.
Most of these difficulties seemed to be attributable to the automated nature of the sys tem, which did not take into account the needs of customers, she added. "The families affected can pay a heavy price when payments are drastically reduced or stopped altogether to recover overpayments."
Other problems she highlighted included:
* computer and human errors, such as unrelated customers' details being mixed up;
* poor information on tax credit award notices sent out - some were "unintelligible";
* poor accessibility, with phone lines being engaged and letters not answered;
* the fact that it was "virtually impossible" to speak to someone about a complaint.
Perhaps most worrying for the government, she questioned whether the system could "ever truly work" for families on low incomes.
She said changes had to be made urgently because an extra 800,000 people on low incomes were due to come into the system.
The ombudsman recommended that "consideration be given to writing- off all overpayments caused by official error which occurred during 2003-04 and 2004-05".
She does not disclose how much this could amount to, but official figures issued this month revealed that out of a total of 5.7m tax credits made to families in 2003-04 alone, 1.9m - worth almost pounds 2bn - were overpaid. Ms Abraham said there may be a case for a write-off simply on grounds of value for money.
In a separate report published today, charity Citizens Advice also slams the tax credits system and says some of its advisers have had to arrange Salvation Army food parcels for families left without enough money to buy food.
But in a statement, the Revenue, now known as Revenue & Customs, said the vast majority of people had not experienced any problems and the system was now "stable". Illustration
