The poor must pay for Brown's dreams

When Gordon Brown first gave his Mansion House speech surrounded by taffeta ball gowns and tailcoats, he made it clear that he was different. The new Chancellor briefed journalists that he would be wearing a "lounge suit and tie'' to the Lord Mayor's dinner. He wasn't there to cosy up to the great and the good, he was there to help the downtrodden masses.
Eight years later he is still wearing the same tie under the chandeliers. And he hasn't gone back on his promise. Only now his ambitions extend beyond Leeds and Liverpool to Liberia and Lithuania. All his life this minister's son has striven to help the poor. His aims are laudable, his principles high, his rhetoric higher.
In his speech on Wednesday he made it clear that not only would Africa be included in his noble quest but he was now determined that the sick countries of Europe would also benefit from the lessons of Brownomics.
And yet as they were toasting his speech at the Lord Mayor's Palace, two reports were published showing that in Britain the very people he has been trying to help most have been failed by his policies.
Far from the Mansion House, Mr Brown's deserving poor - those who have weaned themselves off benefits and found a job - have been left floundering by his tax credits. Some have been surviving on Salvation Army food parcels in order to return overpayments to the Government. Others have been forced to hold bring-and-buy sales to keep a roof over their heads.
Tax credits seemed such a clever idea. They were intended to subsidise poorly paid work through the tax system, remove the stigma of benefits, and make work pay. Yet five years after they were first introduced, both the Parliamentary Ombudsman and the Citizens Advice Bureaux have been inundated with complaints, and describe a system in chaos. Last year, the CAB dealt with 150,000 clients complaining about tax credits. The policy now accounts for one quarter of the ombudsman's time.
Instead of a great idea like independence for the Bank of England, it now looks like another Child Support Agency fiasco.
Nearly six million families are supposed to benefit from tax credits. In the past two years, two million have been overpaid, some by more than pounds 5,000 - at a cost to the Government of pounds 1.9 billion. More than pounds 600 million of this was due to computer or clerical error. Much of it occurred because the forms are more complicated than a flatpack kitchen.
Many families spent their windfalls when they received them (wouldn't you?), often because they didn't realise there had been a mistake in payments. Others, showing extraordinary honesty, repeatedly tried to ring the help-line staff to point out their error.
One family spent six months trying to inform the Revenue that one of their children had died. No one took up their query. Suddenly, they were presented with a large bill for repayment, and are having to remortgage their house to cope. The woman wrote: "My husband and I are at breaking point due to the pressure and stress.''
A lone parent with a six-year-old child was surviving on pounds 27 a week because she could not get through to the hotline to explain that her child was not 16. Even if she had managed to log her complaint, the Treasury has admitted that it is dealing with "hundreds of thousands'' of appeals that are taking four to six months to be resolved.
Letters to the ombudsman sound desperate. One woman who gave up her job to care for her severely handicapped child telephoned twice a week for a year to ensure the Revenue received the right information. "I have provided the correct details dozens of time to dozens of different people,'' she wrote. "They have finally written telling me I must pay back pounds 5,000; I have now become ill through this worry.''
Meanwhile, 713,000 households have been underpaid a total of pounds 464 million. Cases were mixed up, there were errors in scanning and technical glitches. The ombudsman upheld more than 78 per cent of complaints. One lone parent with two teenage children was advised by the Revenue that she had been overpaid by pounds 515.16. Her tax credit was reduced to recover the overpayment, leaving her with pounds 40 a week to live on after rent.
"The frustration, anger and mental anguish I feel over this disaster is almost too difficult to put into words,'' she writes. "There is absolutely nothing to cut back on except food.'' She was surviving on anti-depressants. Yet, when her case was investigated, she was found to have been underpaid.
The people most affected are those right at the bottom of the ladder, for whom an under- or over-payment of pounds 10 a week can make a serious difference, or those who have just had a baby, got divorced or lost their job and whose circumstances change, requiring a reappraisal - in other words, people whose lives are already under strain.
Tony Blair this week apologised for the "hardship or distress suffered by some families''. Dawn Primarolo, the Paymaster General, who was summoned to the House to make an emergency statement, continues to insist that the "system works very well''.
Yet Mr Brown is failing the poor. His high-minded system is far too complicated. Instead, the people who are benefiting are the middle classes. Higher-rate taxpayers can save up to pounds 2,000 in childcare vouchers to pay for their nannies and nurseries. And if any of their children were born after September 1, 2002, the Child Trust Fund means they can hand their child a pounds 35,000 tax- free present when they are 18. Families earning up to pounds 58,000 a year can claim some tax credits, which they surely don't need to survive.
At the Mansion House, Mr Brown had his head in the clouds but his feet in the muck of his tax credits. He must learn to look down and see that his flat-footed policies sometimes squash those he most wants to help.
