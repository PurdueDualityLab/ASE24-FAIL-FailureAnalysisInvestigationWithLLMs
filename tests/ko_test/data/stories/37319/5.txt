MELBOURNE, May 19 AsiaPulse - The ANZ bank (ASX:ANZ) has apologised to 200,000 Mastercard users and will refund millions of dollars it overcharged them by accidentally double-dipping their accounts.
Spokesman Paul Edwards said the "embarrassing" glitchaffected a total of 400,000 Mastercard transactions with a value of $A45 million ($US34.32 million) between 9pm (AEST) last Friday and 5pm on Monday.
"We owe retailers and customers an apology," he said.
"Our first priority's been to make sure people are refunded."
The error, which was detected on Tuesday, only affected non-ANZ Mastercard users.
"It's extra embarrassing for us because we've impacted on people who aren't even our customers," Mr Edwards said.
Once customers had realised they had been charged twice, they had complained to the retailers.
"We've got a group of unhappy retailers who have had customers call them up," he said.
The bank processed areversal of the transactions on Wednesday and Mr Edwards said those affected should have the money returned to their accounts - along with any interest charged - today.
An internal review will take place to determine how the glitch occurred.
"That's our aim, that itdoesn't happen (again) and we've put some additional checks and balances in place to ensure that," Mr Edwards said.
"It's not clear whether it's been human error or a computer glitch."
