ONE of Australia's biggest banks, the ANZ, has apologised to thousands of Mastercard users and promised refunds of millions of dollars for accidentally overcharging them.
The bank said yesterday it had refunded 200,000 customers a total of $45 million after it accidentally double-dipped their accounts because of a computer glitch.
The malfunction affected 400,000 transactions between 9pm last Friday and 5pm on Monday, resulting in the Mastercard customers being charged twice.
The error, detected on Tuesday, only affected non-ANZ Mastercard holders using ANZ eftpos facilities.
"We owe retailers and customers an apology," ANZ spokesman Paul Edwards said.
"It's extra embarrassing for us because we've impacted on people who aren't even our customers."
Retailers bore the brunt of the mistake, with angry customers complaining to them about being ripped off.
The bank processed a reversal of the transactions on Wednesday and Mr Edwards said those affected should have had the money returned to their accounts -- along with any interest charged -- by yesterday.
Mr Edwards said only non-ANZ customers were affected because accounts linked to other banks were processed separately.
"There was a routine administration upgrade done to the file processing on Monday night and there has been a glitch which was subsequently corrected," he said.
"It hasn't happened before and . . . we certainly don't want it to happen again, we're doing everything we can to put some additional process checks in place to ensure it won't happen again.
"It's sort of fortunate and unfortunate in equal measure, we haven't impacted on our customers but it is embarrassing for us.
"We're obviously very disappointed we've let those people down."
Australian Consumer Association spokesman Nick Coates said banking mistakes usually involved human or computer error and resulted in customers being charged the wrong fees or interest rates.
"Mistakes are common, not double-dipping, but in these instances we would want to see that the mistake is quickly identified, the customers affected identified and their accounts reimbursed," he said.
