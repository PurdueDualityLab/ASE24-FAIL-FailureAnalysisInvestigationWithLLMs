The ANZ bank has apologised to hundreds of thousands of Mastercard credit card holders who have been charged twice for purchases they made between last Friday and Monday.
The double-debiting has involved around 400,000 transactions with a value of $45 million.
The problem was caused by a glitch with ANZ's computers, although only credit card holders with other banks have been affected.
A spokesman for ANZ, Paul Edwards, says the customers should have the money returned by today and any fees or charges will also be credited back to customers' accounts.
'It's an embarrassing glitch and certainly of this scale 400,000 transactions is not something we want to undertake again but we owe our customers an apology,' he said.
'We'll get to the bottom of this.'
The Australian Consumer Association says double-dipping appears to be common in the banking industry.
The association's Nick Coates says it is hoped the bank will be proactive in fixing the problem.
'We would just hope that they move quickly and efficiently and actually identify the customers affected rather than wait for customers to come to them,' he said.
The New South Wales Government says hundreds of thousands of Mastercard holders whose accounts were wrongly debited by the ANZ have a right to be angry.
New South Wales Fair Trading Minister Dianne Beamer says the incident highlights the need for cardholders to check their monthly bank statements.
'It really is difficult to understand how banks can actually put through a charge twice to their customers, but really it shows you that what you've got to do is check your bills and understand that these mistakes can happen and happen against you,' she said.
