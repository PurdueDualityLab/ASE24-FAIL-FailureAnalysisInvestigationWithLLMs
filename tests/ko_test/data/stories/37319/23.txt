ANZ ERROR
The ANZ Bank todayapologised to 200,000 Mastercard users and will refund millions of dollars it overcharged them by accidentally double-dipping their accounts.
Spokesman Paul Edwards said the "embarrassing" glitch affected about 400,000 Mastercard transactions with a value of $45 million between 9pm last Friday and 5pm on Monday.
"We owe retailers and customers an apology," he said.
"Our first priority has been to make sure people are refunded."
The error, detected on Tuesday, only affected non-ANZ Mastercard users.
"It's extra embarrassing for us because we've impacted on people who aren't even our customers," Edwards said.
Once customers realised they were charged twice they complained to the retailers.
"We've got a group of unhappy retailers who have had customers call them up," he said.
