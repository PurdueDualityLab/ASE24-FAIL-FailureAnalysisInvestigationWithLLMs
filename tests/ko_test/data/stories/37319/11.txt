CITIGROUP DENIES INSIDERTRADING Citigroup, defending an Australian lawsuit that accuses the world's biggest bank by market value of insider trading and failing to manage conflicts of interest, denied any wrongdoing in a defence filed yesterday. The suit, before Justice Peter Jacobson, will test for the first time Australia's insider-trading laws against a company. ANZ `SORRY' FOR CHARGING TWICE The ANZ bank has apologised to 200,000 Mastercard users and will refund millions of dollars it overcharged them by accidentally double-dipping their accounts. Spokesman Paul Edwards said the ``embarrassing'' glitch affected a total of 400,000 Mastercard transactions with a value of A$45 million ($56 million) between 9pm last Friday and 5pm on Monday. The error, which was detected on Tuesday, only affected non-ANZ Mastercard users.
RESOURCES SECTOR DRAGSDOWN ASX The Australian stock market was dragged lower by the resources sector yesterday, ending a week of significant decline for the local bourse. The S&P/ASX200 was down 18.4 points to 5100.9 by the close. Macquarie Equities adviser Helen Spencer said the market had been subdued yesterday after recording its biggest one-day fall on Thursday since October last year. ``There's been some caution on the back of recent volatility in the commodity prices and that has created some profit-taking in the resources sector,'' Spencer said.
