ONE of Australia'sbiggest banks, the ANZ, has apologised to thousands of Mastercard users and promised refunds of millions of dollars for accidentally overcharging them.
The bank said yesterdayit had refunded 200,000 customers a total of $45 million after it accidentally double-dipped their accounts because of a computer glitch.
The malfunction affected400,000 transactions between 9pm last Friday and 5pm on Monday, resulting in the Mastercard customers being charged twice. The error, detected on Tuesday, affected only non-ANZ Mastercard holders using ANZ EFTPOS facilities.
"We owe retailers and customers an apology," said ANZ spokesman Paul Edwards.
"It's extra embarrassing for us because we've impacted on people who aren't even our customers."
Retailers bore the brunt of the error, with angry customers complaining about being ripped off.
The bank processed areversal of the transactions on Wednesday and Mr Edwards said those affected should have had the money returned to their accounts yesterday.
He said only non-ANZ customers were affected because accounts linked to other banks were processed separately.
"There was a routine administration upgrade done to the file processing on Monday night and there has been a glitch which was subsequently corrected," he said.
"It hasn't happenedbefore and . . . we certainly don't want it to happen again. We're doing everything we can to put some additional process check in place to ensure it won't happen again.
"It's sort of fortunateand unfortunate in equal measure. We haven't impacted our customers but it is embarrassing for us. We're obviously very disappointed we've let those people down."
Australian Consumer Association spokesman Nick Coates said banking mistakes usually involved human or computer error and
resulted in customers being charged the wrong fees or interest rates.
"Mistakes are common, notdouble-dipping, but in these instances we would want to see that the mistake is quickly identified, the customers affected identified and their accounts reimbursed."
Mr Coates said he was happy with the ANZ's quick response to rectify the error.
