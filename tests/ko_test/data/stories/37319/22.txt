ANZ Bank apologisedyesterday to 200,000 credit card users after admitting it accidentally overcharged non-ANZ MasterCard holders tens of millions of dollars.
The bank said it hadhanded back a total of $45 million to between 150,000 and 200,000 customers after it had accidentally double-dipped into their accounts.
"It's obviously quite embarrassing for us ... you expect these processes to occur with zero errors," an ANZ spokesman said.
The bank said the error,which hit non-ANZ MasterCard card holders twice with fees when they used one of its eftpos terminals issued to retailers, appeared to be related to an administrative update to the bank's computer systems last week.
ANZ said the error occurred between 9pm last Friday and 5pm on Monday, but it was not detected until Tuesday.
About 400,000transactions were affected, and only non-ANZ MasterCard holders using ANZ-linked eftpos facilities were overcharged, the bank said.
However, it was reported that online shoppers, who made payments to settle their bills, were also charged twice.
Woolworths, whichrecently signed an agreement with ANZ to roll out about 700 ATMs across its chain of supermarkets and liquor stores, declined to comment on the matter.
The ANZ spokesman said the situation was being "put right, right now".
"We are fully confident the money has been refunded to customers," he said.
The spokesman said the computer glitch had been fixed and that the bank had put in place "additional process" to prevent the error recurring.
Australian ConsumerAssociation spokesman Nick Coates said yesterday he was satisfied with the ANZ's quick response to rectify the error.
