ANZ Bank has vowed to scrutinise its administrative systems following its embarrassing $45 million overcharging fiasco.
But the bank cannot guarantee the problem will not happen again.
The Courier-Mail revealedyesterday that a duplicated computer file sent from ANZ to other banks which issue Mastercards caused at least 200,000 non-ANZ customers around the country to be charged twice.
About 400,000 Mastercardpayments made through ANZ-issued Eftpos machines, between 9pm last Friday and 5pm Monday, were all double counted.
Therefore customers using Mastercard to pay for goods and services from merchants with ANZ equipment, were double-charged.
ANZ spokesman Paul Edwards said the bank would examine its systems.
"We need to put in anadditional layer of checks and balances to make sure this doesn't happen again because people have got a right to expect that this sort of `banking 101' happens without any errors," he said.
Mr Edwards said all affected customers should have had their money returned by yesterday morning.
"They should feel confident that we have processed this," he said.
"We're 100 per centconfident at our end but obviously it's other people's money and it's natural that they are concerned that these things happen."
But ANZ could not guarantee that similar bungles would not occur again.
"We'll certainly do our best because our aim is to have these processes running with zero per cent errors," Mr Edwards said.
Westpac spokesman David Lording said thousands of affected Westpac customers had been reimbursed.
"We have done some further testing . . . and it appears that it has been successful," he said.
Virgin Money head ofpublic affairs Kirsty Lamont confirmed that about 1000 of its affected Mastercard holders had also been refunded.
Australian ConsumersAssociation spokesman Nick Coates said banks regularly made mistakes but the important thing was that problems were corrected quickly so consumers were not disadvantaged.
