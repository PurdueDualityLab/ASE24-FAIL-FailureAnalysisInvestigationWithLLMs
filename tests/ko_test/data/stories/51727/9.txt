SINGTEL'S pay-TV unit has been fined $50,000 for a half-day service outage on March 1.
It is the first time a pay-TV provider in Singapore has been fined for such a lapse, and it came on a day when the SingTel unit, SingNet, marked the third anniversary of its pay-TV service.
The Media Development Authority of Singapore (MDA) said yesterday it had decided to fine SingNet for having fallen short of its licensing obligations as a national pay-TV provider.
SingNet 'has to provide pay TV services at a reasonable quality that meets public expectations and is satisfactory to MDA', said the media sector regulator.
SingNet also has to run an efficient consumer service and provide avenues for speedy resolution of consumers' complaints, it added.
SingNet had made efforts to fix the software glitch and resume service, MDA noted, but added that the outage had inconvenienced more than 10,000, or 6 per cent, of its subscribers, not an insignificant number.
MDA said it was SingNet's poor handling of the crisis that prompted it to act.
Frustrated subscribers, left with neither transmission nor explanation for hours, were unable to get through to SingNet's customer service hotline even the day after, said the MDA.
SingTel spokesman Tricia Lee said the company 'regrets the customer inconvenience caused...SingTel prides itself on providing quality products and services, and we continue to strive for improvement'.
It has since fixed the software glitch and beefed up its network to minimise the chance of a recurrence, she said.
