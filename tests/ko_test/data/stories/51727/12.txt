SINGAPORE, July 21 (Bernama) - SingNet, a Singapore pay TV service provider was fined $50,000 (RM120,000) by the state media authority for its television outage on March 1, due to a software glitch.
The Media Development Authority (MDA) said as a nationwide subscription television service licensee, SingNet was required to comply with licence conditions on quality of service and consumer service.
In a statement today, MDA said it had found evidence of SingNet breaching its license conditions on quality of service and consumer service when its Mio TV service broke down around 6am to about 6pm on that day.
MDA said although SingNet took efforts to correct the software malfunction and resume service, the outage impacted more than 10,000 subscribers which was not insignificant and caused a lot of inconveniences.
The authority was of the view that SingNet could also have provided better consumer support and resolved consumer complaints in a timely manner.
MDA said SingNet's call handling was evidently lacking when consumers complained that they could not get through to their call centre for hours, and even on the day after the breakdown.
