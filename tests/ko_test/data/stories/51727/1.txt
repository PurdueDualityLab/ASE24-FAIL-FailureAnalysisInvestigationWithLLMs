(SINGAPORE) Singapore Telecommunications unit SingNet has been slapped with a $50,000 fine from the country's media regulator for its mio TV outage in March.
The Media Development Authority of Singapore (MDA) said that the company had breached its National Subscription Television Service licensing conditions when its pay television service broke down for nearly 12 hours on March 1.
'As a Nationwide Subscription Television Service Licensee, SingNet is required to comply with licence conditions on Quality of Service and Consumer Service. This meant that it has to provide pay TV services at a reasonable quality that meets public expectations and is satisfactory to MDA,' the regulator said in a statement.
While SingTel has been fined for the nearly 12-hour outage, some subscribers had complained of intermittent breakdowns over the course of three days.
MDA said that SingNet could also have provided better consumer support and resolved consumer complaints in a more timely manner.
The breakdown had outraged many affected subscribers and sparked a flurry of complaints on newspaper and online forums.
What made matters worst was that many of those who tried for hours to call the customer hotline were left on hold and in the dark about the cause of the problem.
At the time, SingTel said that the problem was 'a result of a suspected software bug'. Regarding complaints of poor customer service, it said then that the large number of people calling in at the same time contributed to the problem, even though it had bumped up manpower.
Yesterday, a SingTel spokeswoman said that the company has found out what caused the software glitch and has made the necessary software changes to address the issue.
'We have also made changes to our network architecture to minimise the risk of such an incident occurring in the future,' she added.
The outage affected 6 per cent, or around 10,000 subscribers, of SingTel's mio TV customer base in March.
SingTel has some 200,000 mio TV customers as at April this year. Its pay-TV base has swelled in recent months after scoring a major coup over rival StarHub when it won the coveted rights to screen English Premier League matches and other popular sports channels, but has been blighted by customer complaints of poor service delivery.
StarHub still has a commanding lead in the local pay-TV sector with over half a million cable television subscribers.
