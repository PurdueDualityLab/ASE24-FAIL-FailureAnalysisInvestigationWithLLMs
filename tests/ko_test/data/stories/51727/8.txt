WE THANK Mr Harbhajn Singh for his Forum Online feedback ('No World Cup joy for mio TV subscribers'; July 5).
Mr Singh experienced some issues while viewing World Cup matches on mio TV. When he called the hotline, our customer care officer advised him to switch to an alternative channel, but he continued to experience disruption.
We have since arranged a visit to Mr Singh's premises and ascertained that a section of his existing in-home wiring was faulty. The fault was rectified by replacing the wire.
We apologise to Mr Singh for the inconvenience.
