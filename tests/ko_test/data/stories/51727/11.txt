SINGAPORE — SingNet has been fined $50,000 for its Mio TV outage that occurred at around 6am to about 6pm on March 1 due to a software glitch.
As a Nationwide Subscription Television Service Licensee, SingNet is required to comply with licence conditions on Quality of Service (QoS) and Consumer Service, said the Media Development Authority (MDA).
This means that it has to provide pay TV services at a reasonable quality that meets public expectations and is satisfactory to MDA.
SingNet is also required to operate an efficient consumer service and provide avenues for speedy resolution of consumers’ complaints on its service.
MDA said it had found evidence of SingNet breaching its licence conditions on QoS and Consumer Service when its Mio TV service broke down on March 1.
MDA investigations showed that SingNet took efforts to correct the software malfunction and resume service.
However, the outage affected more than 10,000 subscribers, which MDA said “is not insignificant and caused a lot of inconveniences”.
SingNet could also have provided better consumer support and resolved consumer complaints in a timely manner, the authority added. “SingNet’s call handling was evidently lacking when consumers complained that they could not get through to their call centre for hours, and even on the day after the breakdown,” it said.
