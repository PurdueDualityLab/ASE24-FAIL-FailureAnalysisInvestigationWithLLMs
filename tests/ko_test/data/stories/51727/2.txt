SINGAPORE: SingTel's mio TV now has a reach of 1.2 million Singapore households since its launch three years ago.
Speaking to Channel NewsAsia, SingTel's CEO for its Singapore business, Allen Lew, said this is higher than cable TV subscription rate.
SingTel said it plans to make significant investments to enhance its mio TV service.
It has also fixed the earlier glitches faced by its pay-TV system.
Its pay television service broke down for nearly 12 hours on March 1 due to a software glitch.
SingTel said it's confident that mio TV has the safeguards in place to prevent future system crashes.
Mr Lew said SingTel will also double its installation capabilities from 400 to 800 per day in anticipation of the Barclay's Premier League (BPL) in the next two weeks, as well as the start of new seasons for US television series in September and October.
He added that its IPTV service now has 200,000 subscribers and they expect this to grow further in the coming months given the slew of content and interactivity that mio TV will be offering.
Mr Lew said: "The TV business will be the anchor product for our fixed network business in the years ahead. The ability to make mio TV a world class service is critical to us.
"We are very confident that our learnings from World Cup, plus our discussions with other pay-TV providers elsewhere will put us in good stead to ensure that our network is resilient enough to cope with the loads that we will expect during the more popular BPL games.
'Today the IPTV business is a very small part of our revenue, but we can foresee that going ahead with the type of content and platform we have that provides unrivalled interactivity, we will see this becoming more important as a product for SingTel." - CNA/vm
