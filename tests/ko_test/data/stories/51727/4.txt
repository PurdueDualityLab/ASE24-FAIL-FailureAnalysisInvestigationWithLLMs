EVERY home in Singapore can now have access to SingTel's pay-television channel, the telco announced yesterday - just in time for the new English Premier League (EPL) season.
Earlier this month, about 3,000 homes were still unable to receive mio TV, sparking concern among some football fans that they might miss the EPL kick-off on Aug 14.
'We can confirm unequivocally that we have achieved nationwide coverage,' SingTel Singapore chief executive Allen Lew told The Straits Times yesterday.
Calling it a milestone for its three- year-old pay TV service, he said: 'We are now able to reach every single one of the 1.2 million homes here.'
That, he added, was 'even better than the existing provider of cable TV'. It was a dig at rival StarHub, whose reach extends to 99.9 per cent of homes.
SingTel paid an estimated $400 million to wrest exclusive EPL TV rights from StarHub last October, expanding its football programming that also includes the popular Champions League tournament featuring Europe's top clubs.
Civil servant Daniel Lim, 25, had trouble watching the Champions League last season because his home in Telok Kurau could not receive mio TV. 'It was very frustrating. I was forced to go to the pubs just to watch Liverpool,' he said.
But the reception problem has been fixed. Now a mio TV subscriber, he will be able to watch both the EPL and the Champions League at home.
Monthly subscriptions for SingTel's football package cost $24.61 (including GST). All 380 Premier League matches will be screened in high definition.
SingTel said its mio TV subscriber base currently stands at 200,000. StarHub still dominates the pay-TV market with 541,000 subscribers as of March, and has rights to telecast the top football leagues of Spain and Germany.
So far, not everyone has been happy with the quality of mio TV.
The telco was slapped with a $50,000 fine by the Media Development Authority of Singapore last week after its mio TV service broke down for nearly 12 hours on March 1, affecting around 10,000 subscribers.
There were also numerous complaints about technical glitches and poor customer support during the recent World Cup finals in South Africa.
Addressing these concerns, Mr Lew said yesterday that the telco had learnt its lessons from the World Cup and assured customers that the mio TV network would be able to cope during popular EPL matches.
'We saw there were certain gaps and we worked hard to close these gaps,' he said.
But he added that most complaints were due to customers being unfamiliar with operating mio TV.
So from Sunday, SingTel will start a campaign to educate subscribers on how to use mio TV - through house visits or phone calls.
The telco has hired an additional 100 customer relationship executives to accompany technicians making home installations to help guide new subscribers.
Said Mr Lew: 'We will spare nothing to make sure we can take care of our customers.'
Expecting more football fans to sign up at the last minute as the EPL season draws near, SingTel has doubled its installation capacity.
It can now handle up to 800 installations a day.
Commenting on the news from SingTel, CIMB economist Song Seng Wun said yesterday: 'SingTel's 100 per cent reach will have some impact because more sport fanatics will have access to mio TV.
'But whether it comes at the expense of StarHub's market share remains to be seen. And do not forget, there are increasingly more options available like streaming off the Internet.'
Despite the government mandate in March that future pay-TV content be shared between telcos, Mr Lew maintained that SingTel will continue to invest in improving its mio TV service.
