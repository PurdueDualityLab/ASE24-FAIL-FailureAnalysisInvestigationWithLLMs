Thousands of Ohio crimevictims received calls from a computer notification system yesterday mistakenly telling them inmates had been released, a state prisons spokesman said.
The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction believes the problem stemmed from a computer glitch that happened during maintenance.
The agency was double-checking to ensure that no inmates were accidentally released, spokesman Brian Niceswanger said.
About 3,000 calls were made starting at noon yesterday, he said. The system was shut down when the glitch was discovered about an hour later when concerned crime victims started calling the agency.
