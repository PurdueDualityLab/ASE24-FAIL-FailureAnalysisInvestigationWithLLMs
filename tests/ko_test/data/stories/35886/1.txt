COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Thousands of Ohio crime victims received calls from a computer notification system on Friday mistakenly telling them inmates had been released, a state prisons spokesman said.
The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction believes the problem stemmed from a computer glitch that happened during maintenance. The agency was double-checking to ensure that no inmates were accidentally released, spokesman Brian Niceswanger said.
