Thousands of Ohio crime victims received calls from a computer notification system mistakenly telling them inmates had been released, a state prisons spokesman said. The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction believes the problem was caused by a computer glitch that happened during maintenance. The agency was double-checking to ensure that no inmates were accidentally released, said a spokesman, Brian Niceswanger. About 3,000 calls were made starting at noon yesterday. Officials learned of the glitch about an hour later after crime victims started calling the agency.
