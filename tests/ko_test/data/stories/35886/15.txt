A computer system glitch initiated phone calls today, incorrectly notifying thousands of crime victims across the state that their offenders were being released from prison.
"It's just been such a traumatic day for the crime victims in our community," said Joy Thomas, program director of the Clark County Victim/Witness Services.
About 3,000 crime victims registered with the Victim Information and Notification Everyday system -- a national program that provides victims the custody status of offenders -- received the accidental calls starting about noon.
The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction corrected the problem before 3 p.m., but not before striking fear in the victims.
"This is just a major traumatic event for these people because they just relive it again," Thomas said, adding that more than 20 local victims have contacted the victim/wittness and prosecutor's offices concerned by the calls.
The state Office of Victim Services will have staff available until 8 p.m. tonight and between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Saturday to verify correct release information, and can be contacted at 888-842-8464.
