COLUMBUS, Ohio - Thousands of Ohio crime victims received calls from a computer notification system Friday mistakenly telling them that inmates had been released, a state prisons spokesman said.
Officials with the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction think the problem stemmed from a computer glitch that happened during maintenance. The agency was double-checking to ensure no inmates were accidentally released, spokesman Brian Niceswanger said.
About 3,000 calls were made starting at noon Friday, he said. The system was shut down when the glitch was discovered about an hour later, when concerned crime victims started calling the agency. It was turned on again later and will be watched through the weekend.
Officials still were trying to determine how many inmates the calls involved because some inmates had multiple victims or victims put others on the notification list.
The department computer system that tracks the release of inmates was undergoing maintenance Thursday night when a file listing inmates' names was activated and accidentally sent to a contractor, Appriss Inc. of Louisville, Ky., that handles the automated notifications. A function preventing calls at odd hours put the calls off until Friday.
Appriss determined who had been called and began telling victims of the mistake Friday afternoon, company spokesman Rick Jones said.
The corrections department received dozens of calls from victims, Niceswanger said. The cause of the glitch had not been determined by Friday afternoon.
Charles Humphrey of Newark, who was on the list because of a sexual assault against a relative, said he got a call then tried unsuccessfully to contact the victim-services unit. He said the timing was especially bad because he was preparing to travel out of state Friday night to bring the relative to his home for the New Year's holiday.
