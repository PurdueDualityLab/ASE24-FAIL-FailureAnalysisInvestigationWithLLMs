COLUMBUS, Ohio [AP] -- Thousands of Ohio crime victims received calls from a computer notification system on Friday mistakenly telling them inmates had been released, a state prisons spokesman said.
The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction believes the problem stemmed from a computer glitch that happened during maintenance. The agency was double-checking to ensure no inmates were accidentally released, spokesman Brian Niceswanger said.
About 3,000 calls were made starting at noon Friday, he said. The system was shut down when the glitch was discovered about an hour later when concerned crime victims started calling the agency.
It was turned on again later and would be watched through the weekend.
The corrections department received dozens of calls from victims, Niceswanger said. The cause of the glitch had not been determined by Friday afternoon.
