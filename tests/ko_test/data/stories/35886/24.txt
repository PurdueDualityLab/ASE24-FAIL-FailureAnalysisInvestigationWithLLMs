MIAMI -- Former "enemycombatant" Jose Padilla returned to court yesterday, a day after his transfer from military to civilian custody, but a judge agreed to postpone hearing his plea and deciding whether he should be granted bail.
Mr. Padilla's lawyers hadasked for the delay, saying they needed more time to sort through the complex case. U.S. Magistrate Judge Barry Garber set a new hearing for Monday.
Prosecutors want JudgeGarber to deny bail for Mr. Padilla, 35, who was taken from a South Carolina brig and flown to Miami on Thursday after three years in military custody. He is accused of being part of a North American terror support cell seeking to provide money, material and fighters for violent Islamic extremists around the world.
Wal-Mart promo glitch
Human error is to blamefor an offensive link at Wal-Mart's Web site that recommended a film about Martin Luther King Jr. to potential buyers of a "Planet of the Apes" DVD, the retail company said yesterday.
The mistake resulted froma well-intentioned effort to promote a DVD about the black leader, said Carter Cast, president of walmart.com, the online shopping arm of Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
A business manager hadgrouped "Martin Luther King: I Have a Dream" with three other black-themed movies and assigned the package an overly broad category of DVD boxed sets, Mr. Cast said.
So when an online visitorlooked at a listing for the boxed DVD set "Planet of the Apes: The Complete TV Series," the black-themed movies appeared under "similar items."
Mr. Cast said the display juxtaposition may have existed for the past year.
