MIAMI -- In a surprising but nonthreatening curtain call to the Atlantic's busiest-ever hurricane season, Tropical Storm Zeta formed in the open ocean Friday, tying a record for the latest-developing named storm.
Although the National Hurricane Center said Zeta wasn't forecast to become a hurricane or threaten land, Zeta's development was significant because it came a month after the official Nov. 30 end to the unprecedented season.
The season brought a record 14 hurricanes, including Hurricane Katrina, which devastated Louisiana and Mississippi in August, killing more than 1,300 people in the most costly disaster in U.S. history. Forecasters exhausted their list of 21 proper names and began using the Greek alphabet to name storms for the first time.
Zeta -- the 27th named storm of the season and the sixth letter of the Greek alphabet -- was located about 1,065 miles southwest of the Azores, the National Hurricane Center reported at 3 p.m. CST Friday. Zeta had maximum sustained winds of 50 mph and was moving northwest near 7 mph.
Erroneous phone calls tell of prisoners' release
COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Thousands of Ohio crime victims received calls from a computer notification system on Friday mistakenly telling them inmates had been released, a state prisons spokesman said.
The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction believes the problem stemmed from a computer glitch that happened during maintenance. The agency was double-checking to ensure no inmates were accidentally released, spokesman Brian Niceswanger said.
About 3,000 calls were made starting at noon Friday, he said. The system was shut down when the glitch was discovered about an hour later when concerned crime victims started calling the agency. It was turned on again later and would be watched through the weekend.
Officials still were trying to determine how many inmates the calls involved because some inmates had multiple victims or victims put others on the notification list.
Eight earthquake survivors rescued; at least 43 dead
DHAFEER, Yemen -- Workers pulled eight survivors from the rubble of their village Friday amid the moaning of others still trapped beneath a landslide -- victims one official said probably would not survive because falling rocks have slowed the rescue.
At least 43 people were killed in Wednesday's landslide in the small Yemeni village of Dhafeer, including eight family members whose bodies were recovered Friday, said Bakeel al-Mattari, a city council member. Nearly 100 others remained trapped beneath the rubble.
The village, located about 60 miles north of the Yemeni capital of San'a, was partially buried Wednesday night after the side of Dhafeer Mountain broke loose and crashed on the hamlet.
Pack of Chihuahuas attacks police officer
FREMONT, Calif. -- A pack of angry Chihuahuas attacked a police officer who was escorting a teenager home after a traffic stop, authorities said.
The officer suffered minor injuries, including bites to his ankle, Detective Bill Veteran said.
The five Chihuahuas escaped from the 17-year-old boy's home and rushed the officer in the doorway Thursday, authorities said. The teenager had been detained after the traffic incident.
The officer was treated at a hospital and returned to work less than two hours later.
