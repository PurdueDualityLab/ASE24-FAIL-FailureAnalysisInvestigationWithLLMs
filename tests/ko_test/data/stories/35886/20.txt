Kaye Wintrow stayed home from work Friday, upset by the recorded voice coming across her phone line telling her that her son's killer was released from prison -- four years earlier than she expected.
"I couldn't believe what I was hearing," said Wintrow, of Springfield. "I guess I listened to it three times I was so stunned."
A computer system glitch initiated phone calls Friday, incorrectly notifying thousands of crime victims across the state that their offenders were released from prison.
About 3,000 crime victims registered with the Victim Information and Notification Everyday system -- a national program that provides victims the custody status of offenders -- received the accidental calls starting about noon.
The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction stopped calls about an hour later, but not before striking fear in the victims.
More than 20 local victims called or came to the prosecutor's or victim/witness office fearful that their safety could be in jeopardy because of the murderers, sex offenders, home invaders and domestic violence offenders they were told would be free to roam the community years before their sentences were completed.
"It's just been such a traumatic day for the crime victims in our community," said Joy Thomas, program director of the Clark County victim/witness services. "This is just a major traumatic event for these people because they just relive it again."

Bayes, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in 2000 and sentenced to serve nine years, will be release eventually, but she wasn't ready to hear the news about 1 p.m. Friday.
"It devastated me. It really devastated me," Wintrow said. "Holidays are hard enough. We just got over Christmas ... and to hear this the day before New Year's ..."
Wintrow and her husband tried calling a verification number provided in the phone message but could never get through, and they didn't know until her husband saw the evening news that the call was wrong.
"Yes, I feel better now, but physically I still feel sick inside because I just wasn't expecting it," she said. "If you could imagine that he's served only five years of his life, and I thought 'he's done, he's out' -- I was devastated."
Wintrow said other family members of her son Dwight Harness, who Bayes strangled in October 1999, also were contacted by through call system Friday.
The Department of Rehabilitation and Correction attributes the problem to an inaccurate file being sent to the company that operates the automated system, Department Spokesman Brian Niceswanger said.
The department usually sends daily messages to the operator, listing inmates who will be released, but during computer maintenance Thursday night, an incorrect list somehow was sent, he said.
The automated system leaves messages on voice mail and answering machines, and Clark County Prosecutor Stephen Schumaker said he was concerned people would get the messages when they got home from work Friday evening -- after his office was closed -- and worry they had no where to turn with question.
Follow-up calls were sent through the phone system to many victims who received the erroneous information. The follow-up calls explained the problem and notified victims how to verify the call's accuracy, Niceswanger said.
He said this type of computer glitch has never happened to the department before, and that it only affected victims registered for information about Ohio offenders.
The department will try to determine how many of the calls were valid and how many were caused by the error, but did not have a number Friday night, he said.
The department's Office of Victim Services will have staff available between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. today to verify correct release information and can be contacted at 888-842-8464.
