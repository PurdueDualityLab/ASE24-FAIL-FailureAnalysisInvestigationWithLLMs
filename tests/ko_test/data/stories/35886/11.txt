The sister of a murdered Madison Township woman was stunned Friday when she got a call stating that her sister's killer, James Lawson, had been released from prison.
It was a mistake, but she wasn't the only one who received such a false alarm.
The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction called approximately 3,000 erroneous release notifications placed by an automated system to crime victims on Friday afternoon a "glitch."
Karla Edwards, the sister of Cheryl Durkin, who was killed in 1998, said her notification was "terrifying"
Friday afternoon, Edwards received a call from the Victim Information and Notification Everyday (VINE) system telling her James Lawson, the man convicted of killing her sister Cheryl Durkin, had been released from prison that day.
"I came unglued," Edwards said. "I can't even tell you how bad it was, I couldn't even talk."
She called Chief Deputy Tony Dwyer of the Butler County Sheriff's Office, who, along with Middletown Detective Frank Hensley, investigated the case and testified at Lawson's trial.
"I was crying so hard, I know he didn't know who I was. But he made some calls and found out it wasn't true," Edwards said. She also began calling her contacts in the department of corrections and got confirmation within about 90 minutes that Lawson was still behind bars at Warren Correctional Institution.
"I was relieved, but I just couldn't believe something like this could happen," Edwards said. "I am still shaking."
Dwyer said his department also received several calls from victims about the messages and all were very "alarmed."
"My first thought was there had been some type of malfunction in the notification system," Dwyer said, noting he did not believe Lawson and the others were free. "But it caused a lot of concern for victims and families."
Lawson is serving a 15 years to life sentence on the charges of murder, tampering with evidence and abuse of a corpse. He killed Durkin by hitting her in the head at his Garfield Street home, then used a power saw to dismember her in the basement of the house.
"It was a computer glitch," said Brian Niceswanger, spokesman for the department of corrections. He said information technology personnel were working on the servers Thursday night and a data file was accidently sent to the VINE system.
The erroneous calls were placed beginning at about noon and the system was shut down at about 1 p.m. During that time approximately 3,000 calls went out, Niceswanger said. "It was quite the speed dialer."
The department fielded hundreds of frantic calls throughout the day and into the night. Niceswanger said victims and their families also called the prisons, prosecutors and law enforcement officers.
The office of victim services will be available today from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. to verify the correct release information for those who received calls Friday. Call (614) 752-1150 or 1-888-842-8464.
Niceswanger said people are released from prison daily, so some of the messages that were sent were correct, but the large majority were not. A corrected message about the status of inmates can also be found on the department of correction's Web site at www.drc.state.oh.us.
Durkin's mutilated torso was found on a bank of the Great Miami River in April 1998. It turned into a murder mystery that piqued the interest of residents and law enforcement officers. It became even more intriguing as the case took many strange twists and turns including a three-month run from the law. Lawson was captured in Carrollton, Ky., a few days after Thanksgiving 1998.
Days before Lawson's trial in 1999, his mother, Rufus Street, was sentenced to four years in prison for tampering with evidence and obstruction of justice. She had her daughter transport parts of Durkin's body to two grave sites in Preble County and Brookville, Ind.
On Sept. 1, 1998, Lawson's sister provided investigators with information that led them to the shallow graves where Dwyer and Hensley dug up Durkin's head, legs, feet, arms and hands. The discovery resulted in a warrant being issued for Lawson's arrest, but he had fled the area.
Lawson's next parole hearing date is Nov. 23, 2018.
