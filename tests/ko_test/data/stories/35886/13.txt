'Glitch' leads to real terror for some/1-5

A "computer glitch" in the state prisons department's computer system rightfully angered thousands of crime victims late last week when they were mistakenly informed that inmates had been released.
The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction says approximately 3,000 erroneous release notifications were placed by an automated system before the calls were halted.
However, the good news is that the glitch only triggered phone calls, not actual releases.
The sister of a murdered Madison Township woman was one of those stunned Friday when she got a call stating that her sister's killer, James Lawson, had been released.
Karla Edwards, the sister of Cheryl Durkin, who was killed in 1998, said her notification was "terrifying"
Edwards received a call from the Victim Information and Notification Everyday system on Friday afternoon telling her James Lawson, the man convicted of killing Durkin, had been released from prison that day.
"I came unglued," Edwards said. "I can't even tell you how bad it was, I couldn't even talk."
She called Chief Deputy Tony Dwyer of the Butler County Sheriff's Office, who helped investigate the case and testified at Lawson's trial.
"I was crying so hard, I know he didn't know who I was. But he made some calls and found out it wasn't true," Edwards said. "I was relieved, but I just couldn't believe something like this could happen."
Apparently the VINE system that tracks the release of inmates was undergoing maintenance by agency employees last Thursday night when a file listing inmates' names was activated and accidentally sent to a contractor that handles the automated notifications.
The contractor, Louisville, Ky.-based Appriss Inc., activates the system when it receives a signal to do so from the computer in Ohio, spokesman Rick Jones said. The company received the file Thursday night, but the calls went out later because of a normal function that prevents calls at odd hours.
Appriss serves about 1,500 criminal justice agencies nationwide.
Although the cause of the mistake has proven elusive, it's imperative officials with both the company and the department of correction keep looking.
If the cause can't be found, then we believe procedures should be put in place to safeguard against people being "terrified" for no reason at all.
