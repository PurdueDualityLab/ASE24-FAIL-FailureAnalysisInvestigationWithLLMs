LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -For the second time in less than two weeks, a Louisville company is explaining why automated calls were mistakenly made to crime victims saying that inmates were released.
About 80 people received calls Monday because of a "glitch"in the automated system caused when a metro government system update affected data, said Rick Jones, a spokesman for Appriss, the Louisville-based company that runs the system.
"It's our goal to alwaysprovide accurate information. We apologize," said Jones, adding that the system was shut down within minutes of the inaccurate calls being made, and the problem was repaired by early evening.
It was minor compared to a glitchalmost two weeks ago that led to about 3,000 calls to Ohio residents mistakenly informing them that prison inmates there had been released. The notification system was shut down after concerned crime victims started calling the agency about an hour after the calls started.
That incident led to"safeguards" to alert workers to errors in notification, Jones said. It was those safeguards that led to Monday's shutdown within minutes of the glitch, he said.
The notification program-- called Victim Information and Notification Everyday -- began in Kentucky after a Louisville woman was killed in 1993 by an ex-boyfriend who she thought was in jail. The system now operates in 1,500 communities in 40 states, making about 400,000 notifications a month.
Louisville residentKimberly Watts said she understands errors can occur, but that the call she got Monday only further shook her trust in the justice system. Her ex-husband, Joseph Robert Watts, is in jail awaiting trial on several charges, including beating and threatening to kill his former wife.
He was mistakenly released briefly in July, after a paperwork mix-up at the jail and has shown up at his ex-wife's home.
"I don't think I'lldepend on the system like I did," Kimberly Watts said. "If they're going to develop it to save someone's life, then it needs to work correctly."
