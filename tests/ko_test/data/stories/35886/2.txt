3,000 crime victims given erroneous alert
COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Thousands of Ohio crime victims received calls from a computer notification system on Friday mistakenly telling them that inmates had been released, a state prisons spokesman said.
The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction believes that the problem stemmed from a computer glitch that happened during maintenance.
The agency was double-checking to ensure that no inmates were accidentally released, a spokesman said.
About 3,000 calls were made starting at noon Friday. The system was shut down an hour later when the glitch was discovered after concerned crime victims started calling the agency.
The department computer system that tracks the release of inmates was undergoing maintenance Thursday night when a file listing inmates' names was activated and accidentally sent to a contractor that handles the automated notifications.
The cause of the glitch has not been determined.

Abu Ghraib case figure burned in brig kitchen
SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Lynndie England, the U.S. soldier who posed for some of the most infamous pictures of detainee abuse at Baghdad's Abu Ghraib prison, suffered burns at the prison where she is serving her sentence, her family said Friday.
Kenneth England said his daughter was injured three weeks ago in the kitchen at Naval Consolidated Brig Miramar when she reached for a pan of chicken and grease splattered on her neck and chest.
She was taken to the hospital, where she was told to put ice on the injury. She later had to ask for burn cream, he said.
He last spoke with his daughter on Christmas, when she told him she was doing better.
Navy Lt. William Marks said England, 23, received immediate medical condition and follow-up care.

Record-tying storm forms beyond season
MIAMI (AP) -- In a surprising but nonthreatening curtain call to the Atlantic's busiest-ever hurricane season, Tropical Storm Zeta formed Friday, tying a record for the latest-developing named storm.
Although the National Hurricane Center said Zeta wasn't forecast to become a hurricane or threaten land, Zeta's development was significant because it came a month after the official Nov. 30 end to the unprecedented season.
The season brought a record 14 hurricanes, including Hurricane Katrina, which devastated Louisiana and Mississippi in August, killing more than 1,300 people in the most costly natural disaster in U.S. history.
Forecasters exhausted their list of 21 proper names and began using the Greek alphabet to name storms for the first time.
Zeta -- the 27th named storm of the season -- was about 1,065 miles southwest of the Azores and had maximum sustained winds of 50 mph.
Since record keeping began in 1851, only one other named storm has formed as late as Zeta. Tropical Storm Alice developed Dec. 30, 1954.

Pack of 5 Chihuahuas attack police officer
FREMONT, Calif. (AP) -- A pack of angry Chihuahuas attacked a police officer who was escorting a teenager home after a traffic stop, authorities said.
The officer suffered minor injuries, including bites to his ankle, Detective Bill Veteran said.
The five Chihuahuas escaped the 17-year-old boy's home and rushed the officer in the doorway Thursday, authorities said. The teenager had been detained after the traffic incident.
The officer was treated at a hospital and returned to work less than two hours later.
