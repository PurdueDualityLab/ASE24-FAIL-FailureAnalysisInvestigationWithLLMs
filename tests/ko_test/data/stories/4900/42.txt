Calif. To Deregulate Electricity

Three months after the debut was spoiled by technical glitches, California will try a second time to launch a deregulated, $23 billion electricity market designed to lower rates and improve efficiency through competition.
Other states planning deregulation are watching carefully as California's new system begins Tuesday amid big hurdles. Among those are allegations of fraud against two marketing companies and a challenge to a $28 billion utility bailout tacked onto consumers' bills.
''This is the biggest giveaway since California deeded lands to the railroads,'' said Harry Snyder, West Coast director of Consumers Union, one of several groups that like deregulation, but oppose the way California is going about it.
Consumers Union and others are collecting signatures for a proposed ballot initiative that would eliminate the bailout, which pays the cost of bad investments such as nuclear power plants, and long-term contracts to buy electricity from outside providers at high cost.
''I think a lot of people are getting really nervous about the price tag of the stranded-cost bailout for this industry,'' said Adam Thierer, an analyst with the Washington-based Heritage Foundation.
''There's a feeling by consumer groups that the utilities are getting everything they want and more and deregulation is really fiction.''
The campaign isn't the only blemish to mark the restructuring so far. Last December, embarrassed officials announced that the start of the restructured market would be postponed by three months because of problems with software used to coordinate the buying, selling and transmission of power to homes and businesses.
Earlier this month, the Independent Service Operator, the quasi-public agency that will run the power transmission grid, and the Power Exchange, where electricity will be bought and sold, said they had resolved the problems and were ready to open the market Tuesday.
In the meantime, the Public Utilities Commission has said it is beefing up background checks on marketing companies after one, Pennsylvania-based Boston Finney, was accused of operating a pyramid scheme.
''The goal is to create market reform through competition and lead to better prices and better service,'' said Doug Long, California Public Utility Commission program manager who helped set up the deregulated market. ''A delay in the startup and a few bad players trying their luck, they're not enough to overcome the overall good we expect.''
Although it has been labeled deregulation, the changes about to take place in California's electricity market really are more of a restructuring of the electrical industry.
Even after Tuesday, significant regulation will continue:
For the next four years, wholesale rates will be frozen at 1996 levels. This meant a 10 percent drop on Jan. 1 for most retail customers, but not necessarily much more than that until 2002.
The Independent Service Operator, which will control power transmission in deregulated areas, is still subject to state regulation because of its quasi-public status.
About 30 percent of California's power customers are served by municipal power companies, which are not required to join the deregulated market. This includes the Los Angeles Department of Water & Power, the nation's largest municipal utility.
For the rest of the state's power users, restructuring means that for the first time, they can choose their electricity provider much in the way they now pick their long-distance telephone service. More than 200 companies have registered to market electricity to homes and businesses.
Those seeking to repeal the bailout aren't trying to stop deregulation completely. But the ballot initiative could slow some aspects of it, said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy Institute in Berkeley.
''Now they're so far along, I'm not sure they could back out,'' Borenstein said. ''I think the utilities will fight it (the initiative) both politically and in court, and I would be surprised if they lost.''
The utilities contend that the bailout is fair since the costs would have been passed on to customers anyway if deregulation had not begun.
''It seems to be the fairest way to deal with all the stakeholders' interests involved and get us through this transition period,'' said Clarence Brown, a spokesman for Southern California Edison. ''We still stand by that.''
