REP. CURT WELDON (R-PA): The subcommittees will come to order.
This afternoon we will -- (inaudible) -- 1999 Defense budget request. This is a continuing process. Yesterday we did Navy, and my good friend Duncan Hunter was in the chair. We alternate the chairs between the two subcommittees and today I'm chairing the session.

The purpose of today's hearing will be to examine a broad range of Army modernization programs and initiatives. As before, we're sharing that chair. As I mentioned, and our ranking member and good friend Owen Pickett and I from the R And D Committee look forward to working with both Mr. Hunter and our good friend Norm Sisisky, ranking member of the Procurement Subcommittee and all of our colleagues on both subcommittees.
Today appearing before our subcommittees we're pleased to have Dr. Kenneth Oscar, acting Assistant Secretary of the Army for Research, Development and Acquisition. He's accompanied by his military deputy Lieutenant General Paul Kern.
We share a common concern for the decline in defense spending over the last years. Despite a slight increase in requested funding for procurement, Defense Department R&D funding declined again this year and is projected to decrease by an additional 14 percent over the (fitted?). Although the Army's entire modernization budget again appears to be sadly under-funded, I will focus on the Army's R&D funding which has decreased from $5 billion in fiscal year '98 to $4.8 billion in fiscal year '99, which represents only 13 percent of the Defense Department's $31.6 billion request. In comparison, the Army's R&D request continues to be dwarfed by those of the other services, with the Navy at 8.1 billion (dollars) and the Air Force at 13.6 billion (dollars). Even the defense-wide request is 9.3 billion (dollars), almost twice the Army's request.
Again this year, modernization budgets continue to be sacrificed as the bill payer for shortfalls in the Services Personnel and Readiness accounts. The Administration's budget submission to Congress continues to delay funding for modernization until after the turn of the century. In addition, just when the Army's attempting to develop leap-ahead technologies and systems for the Army after next, which will counter the sophisticated threats of the 21st Century, research and development funding is decreasing. That just doesn't make sense. We're raiding our seed corn for the future.
Last Wednesday, 23 members of both the R&D and Procurement Subcommittees received extensive classified briefings from the Central Intelligence Agency analysts regarding a multitude of present and future threats, to include proliferation of weapons systems around the world that pose increasingly stressing threats to our Army. Two days later, four members of the Procurement and R&D Subcommittees took briefings and observed the Commanche (sp) flight demonstration.
As impressed as they were with Commanche, they were amazed that the Army's premier program to develop the quarterback of the digital battlefield has only one single operational prototype. Nobody in their right mind would attempt to develop a sophisticated aircraft such as the Commanche without multiple prototypes. The FA-18 NF development, a modification to an existing aircraft has seven development aircraft. And the F-22 is planned to have about 10 for its development program. We read in the press that the Army has recently been chastised for lobbying the Congress for more money, because a few courageous Army officials believe the Army's share of the Defense Budget is insufficient. The accountants do not question the Army's assessment of its budget, but rather state its crime was being inept at its lobbying effort. Dr. Oscar and General Kern I hope you'll both clearly understand that giving direct and complete answers here today, in response to members' questions, is not lobbying. We expect no less than your candid opinion when requested.
And for the record, I'd like to submit the article in the Wall Street Journal dated February 3rd, 1998, at this point in time, which headline asserts Army officials express displeasure with their share of military budget, with extensive quotes from Lieutenant General David Heedner (sp). I hope General Heedner will not be left out on a limb to, alone, speak out for the shortfalls in R&D funding for the Army.
Mr. Secretary, we welcome and thank you and General Kern for coming to testify today. Before I turn the floor over to you, I'd like to call on Duncan Hunter, Chairman of the Procurement Subcommittee, for any opening remarks he might have.
Mr. Hunter.
REP. DUNCAN HUNTER (R-CA): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And once again, thanks to you and our ranking members for forming this partnership with the R&D and Procurement Subcommittees. And with the massive draw down in funding that's been undertaken with this Administration, I think it's only appropriate, because we're still about $100 billion under what Ronald Reagan spent on procurement in the 1980's.
Let me just paint a backdrop for you, Gentlemen, I think you're probably familiar with it. We had 18 Army divisions when we fought Desert Storm I. Today we have 10. That's not enough, in my estimation, to sustain the (2MRC?) requirement. In fact, we fought both the MRC's, we fought Korea, that required seven Army divisions and we fought Desert Storm, obviously. We employed eight in Desert Storm. Eight and seven's 15, we've got 10.
Just before Korea, I read the testimony of then secretary Lewis (sp) Sullivan (sp), secretary of Defense, and his testimony was to the effect that was surprisingly similar to the testimony that we've received from this Administration. They talk about the military being leaner and meaner, they talk about a reliance on technology, and we relied on a technology in the early 1950's. That technology was, of course, a nuclear weapon that no one else had and we presumed that nobody would mess with the United States because we had that enormous technological advantage.

So we were shocked and amazed when the North Koreans invaded, came across the line and almost drove this great nation's military forces off the Peninsula.
In fact, we called in, I think, the 25th Infantry Division from Japan and it's commander, William Dean, was, General William Dean was captured in the ensuing fighting just north of what became known as the Poisson (sp) Line.
A point that I'm making is, as much as we rely on high-tech, ultimately ground forces have to take land and hold it, and we've massively cut these ground forces. And to compound that problem we've cut, dramatically, the modernization budgets that support the ground forces. Let me go into just a little bit of that. We talked, incidentally, General Kern, we just had a good discussion about the acquisition work force.
We're going to be facing flat budgets and I think it's wrong. I think we're making a big mistake. I think we're going to do the same thing, ultimately, that the Joint Chiefs, I believe, after we were initially beaten up in Korea, unanimously concurred that we needed to have at least an 18 division Army, and we promptly tried to build back to that level. But let's go to the acquisition workforce and your desperate need for modernization.
In the procurement accounts, it's a little over $8 billion. You have, according to what you just told me, about 67,000 acquisition workers. If you take out the depot people, that takes you down to about 53,000, and those people are not metal-benders at depots, those people are the shoppers, the people that are buying the $6.some billion worth of new equipment. That means that we're spending at 53,000 bucks apiece, almost $3 billion on the shopping core.
And that means that if you buy a helicopter for $10 million, you're paying around $3 million to your professional shoppers for the job of buying that piece of equipment. I would suggest to you, that even though historically we've come down dramatically in terms of acquisition personnel, that now that we're down to the point where you folks have a $1.7 billion ammunition deficiency and that's the latest word that we've gotten from the Army with respect to the capability of fighting 2MRC's, when you have the much smaller Army than you've had in the past, when you have almost no new weapons systems coming on board, you need to greatly streamline and that means cut in half and then pick up your share of the cuts in in-strength that we mandated last year.

DOD, overall, we came down from 300,000 professional shoppers to 174,000. We figure we shouldn't have more professional shoppers than we have US Marines, which is 174,000. So call us arbitrary, but I think until you have the same in-strength cuts that we gave, we forced on you military services, on the fighting arm of the US Army, we're not going to have really efficient procurement systems.
You have a very slim budget, even though it's come up a little bit over the last year, and let me go to one other point that I know is important to my friend Curt Weldon, Theatre Ballistic Missile Defense. Your commanders in the Korean theatre, General Tilelli, expressed yesterday extreme concern about the slowness in fielding the ability to stop SCUD missiles, which we know now carry gas, as well as conventional weapons. They've got the ability to hit our airfields, to hit our troop concentrations and to poison those airfields, I think, for a sustained period of time.
We still have very little in line in terms of the ability to shoot down even the slower ballistic missiles. We basically have upgraded capabilities with the Patriot, but little else. I recommended, and I know I'm going to work with Curt and with the Administration officials, as we go into a focus on Technology Acceleration Program, not necessarily with producing a lot of products. You've got (bad?), Navy's got upper-tier, we've got MIAD's, but with respect to being able to shoot down incoming missiles, if that means harnessing up the labs and using their simulation capability, which was recommended this morning by Phil Coyne (sp).
And I had a good talk with General Liles (sp). Unless we accelerate that capability I think that all of us, we up here and you folks, are disserving the 30 some thousand Americans who serve in uniform in the Army just south of the North Korean line.
So we have enormous problems and on the bright side, I look forward to listening to you to talk about what's happening on Commanche. I know you've got a pilot that's going to tell us a little bit about that today. That's a piece of good news. We've got a lot of bleak news and I hope that you'll work with us to solve that problem. And I want to, Mr. Chairman, to welcome again, as we did yesterday, my counterpart and my partner in this effort to modernize the Army, Norman Sisisky of Virginia.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
REP. WELDON: Thank you.
Mr. Pickett.
REP. OWEN PICKETT (D-VA): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I agree with your assessment that the Army's R&D budget is not all that it needs to be if we are to achieve the objectives for the Army after next. That said, I'd like to share a couple of observations that are of increasing concern to me. They have to do with how we spend our R&D dollars.
The first has to do with whether the Army is getting the best return possible for its limited R&D investment. It seems to me that a disconnect is developing between Army requirements for an Army after next and what the current spending plan would develop in the (intervening?) years. To equip the Army after next in the projected fiscal environment for R&D, we may need to start thinking about changing the focus of planned Army R&D investment to more leap-ahead developments as a matter of priority.
For example, most could agree that the Commanche program contains reaching helicopter technology that would be desirable in any Army after next. But some question whether our investment in Crusader will yield technology that we would want in an Army after next. If so, it begs the question whether we should buy it once it's developed. And if we don't buy it, then we've wasted a lot of R&D dollars that we really don't have, in completing its development. One way to avoid this trap is to get better quality yield for our R&D investment so that the systems that result have utility desirable for an Army after next and even beyond that.
The second observation has to do with budgetary discipline with the R&D accounts. We see what happens to the tech-based dollars spent for advanced development and advanced-development dollars being spent for what appears to be procurement. Advanced concept technology developments have been particularly problematical in this regard. No doubt this condition results from attempts to keep programs on track when there are not enough of the right kind of dollars. Nevertheless, because it masks the real problem, it makes honest solutions more difficult for all of us. I think we need to call for and enforce strict discipline in the R&D accounts. This would allow us to identify and respond to R&D shortfalls in a more timely and efficient manner.
Mr. Chairman, I join you in welcoming our witnesses this afternoon and look forward to their testimony. And I thank you for calling this hearing.
REP. WELDON: Thank you, Mr. Pickett.
Mr. Sisisky.
REP. NORMAN SISISKY (D-VA): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I share your concerns with regard to under-funded Army modernization, but I'm also concerned about how the proposed modernization funds would be spent. I and many others, believe that the Army maybe spending too much of its limited budget maintaining legacy systems that it probably would not use in future conflict, and that this spending comes at the expense of modernization.

For example, the Army still spends vast sums of money to operate and maintain equipment that is for all practical purposes non- deployable, perhaps Cobra helicopters are the good example.
Why would a theatre (ph) CINC use precious air lifter sealift to deploy a less capable Cobra when we could deploy in orders of magnitude, more capable Apaches by the same lift.
I think the logic can be extended to include UH, or 1H-UN, OH- 58A, and (SIG?) Iowa helicopters certain track combat vehicles, and other weapons as well. If in fact the Army is spending a lot of money supporting equipment that it likely would not deploy, I think we should consider whether or not the money might be better spent underwriting some of the procurement in R & D costs associated with the reaching modernization required to equip the Army after next.
I know this means aggressively retiring old friends, and I know it will be difficult, nevertheless, I believe the time has come for a dialogue that leads to action on this notion. I welcome you gentlemen today in listening to your remarks.
REP. WELDON: I thank the gentleman from Virginia, and we're always pleased to have our distinguished chairman of the full committee, who amazes me how many hearings he attends besides his duties as the full committee chairman. We'd like to recognize him for any opening comments he'd like to make.
Mr. Spence.
(Off mike.)
Thank you for being here, Mr. Spence.
I have two introductions, one I'm going to call on Mr. Hunter, but we're also pleased to have one of those who are out there where the rubber meets the road, testing our programs, and that is as I understand Chief Warrant Officer John Wayne Armbrust (sp). Gentlemen, would you please identify yourself so we can acknowledge your presence, and thank you for the good work your doing, and we hope to hear from you on your personal observations about the Commanche sometime today. Mr. Hunter, you also have an introduction.
REP. DUNCAN HUNTER (D-CA): Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I think it's appropriate that I introduce the gentlemen I'm going to introduce, with following your introduction because he's the guy that has the record as a helicopter pilot for peace time saves of pilots who have gone down, and he is Dan McKennon (sp), presently the owner of a North American Airlines, and the former head of the CAB, one of the few guys who sunsetted his own agency in Washington, we're still trying to figure that one out.
But Dan is an expert on this new era of terrorist with high technology, and wrote the book on the destruction of the Iraqi nuclear reactor, and has been with the play by play for McNeal (sp) Lair (sp) during the Desert Storm Operation. So, Dan, thank you for being here, and I'd be interested later to get your impressions of this Commanche helicopter. Thank you for being with us.
REP. WELDON: I join with my friend and colleague in welcoming you here, and recognizing you for the work that you have done on behalf of our country. With that, Dr. Oscar, I'll turn the floor over to you. Your statement will be entered into the records, without objection, and you may make whatever comments you'd like to make.
MR. KENNETH J. OSCAR: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. I'd like to introduce just a few more people that we have brought that can answer selective questions, in certain key areas. In addition to General Kern, the Chief Warrant Officer Armbrister (sp), I have Lieutenant General Bill Campbell, who's the Director of Information Systems for Command control communications and computers, he's also the Chief Information Officer for the Army. So, if you have any questions on (Y2K?) or some other computer areas, he would be the one to have detailed knowledge.
Also, Dr. Ted Prosis (sp) is our Deputy Assistant Secretary for Chemical (Demail?). In addition, I have Dr. Finner Milken (ph), who is the Army's Chief Scientist, and the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology. I also have Major General Ron Adams, who's in charge of Forest Developments in (Destile?).
Both General Kern, and I would like to make a brief statement before we get into the key questions, and answers. As we've mentioned over the last several years, the Army has gone through a very difficult process of downsizing budget reductions, and reshaping. During this time, however, the Army has been able to support the US with hurricanes in Florida and Hawaii, riots, floods, fires, drug wars, and peace making and peace keeping operations in Haiti, Somalia, Rwanda, and Bosnia. We have been able to do that in an excellent fashion.
We've had to focus on readiness, and quality of life. And a lot of modernization that we have desired, some of it has been slipped, and pushed to the right. This is the way some of the programs we want to, with your help, we've been able to litigate that some, but there's no doubt that we missed opportunities to put technology into some of our weapons, that we have been buying and procuring weapons at less than their optimum rate, sometimes even below the minimum sustaining rate. And that some of our equipment has indeed aged, especially our truck sweep, some of our trucks in the two and a half ton area are over twenty five years old.
This '99 budget that we are presenting, and discussing today, reverses our trend for the first time in over 10 years, the Army's budget modernization is going up. Our procurement account is eight point two (8.2) billion. While that's only about one sixth of the DOD procurement budget, it's up over a billion dollars from '98, and it continues to go up a billion a year, all the way from '99 to '03. And a lot that the Chem Demail transfer though --
REP. HUNTER: I didn't mean to interrupt you Doctor.
MR. OSCAR: In the near term, yes sir, Mr. Hunter, in the near term, some of that is a Chem Demail, but as you see that at one billion a year, as we get out to '03, there are some significant rises. Some of it though however is Chem Demail.
In our Research Development Testing Engineering Budget, it's four point eight (4.8) billion, which is about one eighth of the DOD R & D budget. It is however, relatively stable and toward the end of the period, '02,'03, starts a gentle rise. I believe the modernization plan that this budget includes is a very balanced program. We have tried to look at our near term readiness, our aging equipment, our future technology, opportunities, and we've put together, I think the best balanced budget we can to ensure that our soldiers have equipment now, and in the future.
Our strategy has five major parts, and I'd just like to briefly go over them. The first is digitization, the second is combat overmatch, the third is equipment recapitalization, the fourth is equipment to support the immigration of the guard and reserve into the active force, and the fifth is to focus our science and technology on the Army after next.
The digitization, the first area, real is going to maximize the use of this rapidly advancing information technology. For several years now, we have been putting into our weapons that we're fielding and upgrading, information technology, it includes computers, data buses, digital radios, GPS.
We have now realized through a series of simulations, water gains, Army warfighting experiments, that we can get a leap ahead capability if we integrate these weapons and computers together in what we call digitization. Much in the same way that AT&T, or America Online integrates all the computers, and telephones, and TV's in your houses, and kind of have a backbone for a switching capability.
We have found that if we can put a mobile internet in into our battlefield, and link all this through switches and internets, we too can get a leap ahead capability and synergize all this information. The National Defense Panel, and the Quadrennial Review both complimented the Army for moving out in information technology. This linking together and in this years budget, and '99 budget, we have devoted $261 million dollars to this linking together. This will leverage the over $2.6 billion that's embedded in our weapons for the information technology portion of these weapons.
Our goal is to fill the digitized division by the year 2000, and fill the digitized CORE by the year 2004.
The second area, or major thrust, is to maintain the combat overmatch that we have now. Take a look at technological opportunities to take a look at the threats and say where can we get the most leverage with a few key weapons. An example of these programs are the Apache Long (Bow?) and the Commanche helicopters, the Crusader, Howitzer, and several missiles such as the Javelin, and the (back homing?) for the -- (inaudible) -- missile.
The third area, is to reverse this thrust of our aging equipment. And this says we've had to go to a combination of some new equipment, some depot rebuild, some service life extensions, to see if how can we best put a program together that will lower our own -- (inaudible) -- operations, and support costs, give us some younger equipment, and stretch the life of some equipment we have.
We've put our major thrust in this area on our truck fleet, our cargo helicopter fleet, our power generators, our water fuel fighter, this is the very equipment that's at war every day. In Bosnia today, we may not be shooting our Howitzers, or our missiles, but our trucks are running up and down the road, and they're putting on a lot of mileage, and they're getting a lot of wear and tear. So this part of the program is to kind of reverse that, and get more life out of this equipment.
The fourth area is to increase the equipment for our guard and reserve as we integrate the guard and reserve into the active force. We've increased in the '99 budget 33 percent the dollars that were put in against the equipment for the guard and reserve. For example, in '99 we're going to be buying 18 Avenger air defense systems, 10 Black Hawk helicopters, 7 -- (inaudible), 200 line haul tractors, 54 20-ton dump trucks for example.
This new equipment together with the cascading equipment has already resulted in the significant increase of equipment in the guard and reserve. For example, we have carefully-- (inaudible) -- the reserve with M-1 tanks, we have 10 Army national guard field artillery units with the -- (inaudible) -- rocket systems. We've fully fueled all 15 of these brigades with Bradley, we've retained 19 reserve component battalions with Apache helicopters, we've modernized 15 reserve component battalions with Black Hawks, and we're equipping 10 reserve companies with -- (inaudible) -- trucks.
The fifth, and final area I want to mention, is to focus our tech base on the Army after next. This digitized the Army that we're fielding from about the year 2000 for the division, and (2004?) for the CORE, all the way up to say (2010?), (2015?), that's our next Army, that's our Information Age Army. The work we're doing in technology, and research today, will start fielding about (2010?) time frame, that will be the Army after next.
We've done a series of war games analysis to determine what's the best technical opportunities, what might that Army next look like? We will designate the second UCR as a test bid kind of a technical test bid just like we've designated the fourth infantry division at Fort Hurd (ph) to detect that technical test bid for digitized next Army, we're going to designate the second ACR as a test bid for the Army after next, and we'll start developing equipment and research and development to put on there to see what's the best combination.
So I feel that the Army, the budget is starting to go up, we're starting to look at reversing some of these trends of the downsizing, I think we have the best balanced plan to maintain our capability in the near term, and in the future to win our countries wars, and to reduce our casualties.
I'd now like to ask General Kern to make a brief statement, and then we'll go on to questions and answers.
MR. KERN: Mr. Chairman, thank you.
I appreciate the opportunity to be here today before the committees, and talk about army modernization. Now first, I'd like to comment on Mr. Hunter's comment about the experience that the US Army and Korea at the beginning of the Korean war. I wear on my right shoulder the patch of the 24th Infantry Division, I served three tours with them and the lessons the task force are not lost on me at all. And I appreciate very much the problems that we've gone through in the past, and do not want to replicate them in the future.
A year ago, General Bill Campbell, and myself were in the Mahabe Desert at this time, and Bill was the Program Executive Officer for your command patrol computers, and I was the Commander of the Experimental Force Division, which was working in the desert. We had a tremendous opportunity to amplify, and learn about what digitization could do for our fighting forces.
As General Campbell pointed out to me many times, it's this new process as well as the soldiers fighting that we have blocked forward very quickly a new capability. I would like to read from a letter if I could, very quickly, what Secretary Kohan (ph) wrote back to me after he visited on his return from this exercise. He said, 'These warfighting experiments may well prove to be as important in defining the Army of the future as George Marshall's, Louisiana maneuvers were to defining the Army that won World War II.' I believe that's a true statement, and we are using the money most efficiently by the new process, as well as the equipping of our forces, and we intend to do that even more efficiently with a focus on the acquisition work force and the process as well as the technology.
Secondly, Secretary Kohan commented, he said, 'I saw soldiers who had mastered complex technology, and turned it to their advantage on the battlefield.' That has been a concern prior to Desert Storm that the Army was fielding technology. And we showed them in Desert Storm, that we have soldiers today that are very capable of using the technology we give them, and using it effectively. And we saw it again in the desert in California, as we provided these new information technologies to our weapons platforms. So we have soldiers that are very capable, and soldiers whom we want to equip for the next battle to be the best equipped again in the world, as well as well trained on that equipment.
The second point I'd like to make, if I could, is just to show you a piece of the Commanche. This is a board, which we call a Samee (sp), it is part of the on-board processor on the Commanche. In 1991 when they started building this, this used to be three boards, and these three boards had a operational capability of about 840 operations per second. And this you might call a Lombopboard (sp). The three boards are now one, and this has one billion operations per second built on this one board. It can be taken in and out very quickly.
Another interesting part of it is that there are no wires that connect these pieces together. A little matrix fits inside there, and that matrix has on top of it a piece of a chip which has contacts that are then screwed down on top. We can change this, and inside those pieces are commercial technology. And so this gives us the ability to maintain currency with technology as it changes, and is we showed over the last few years, we went from a three board to a one in a very reliable system. So the technologies that we are producing today to give to the soldiers are keeping pace with the very fast change over in technology that's taken place. And we can hear much more about how that actually performs from our test pilots as we go on later today for questions.
The last comment I would like to make would be about our acquisition work force in a different aspect. A few weeks ago, I was in Sarajevo visiting some of our contingency contracting officers. These are the same people that we have working in our laboratories, in our procurement offices, who also have jobs supporting the troops in the field. And one young major, whom I had met previously at Fort Mammoth (ph), another whom I had met working up in the contracting command up in the northeast. And they had working for them an Air Force Chief Master Sergeant and a Marine Corps sergeant, a gunny sergeant.

They were working together to sustain our forces with the Bosnians, by working contingency contracting and providing services back to our soldiers. So, I would like to says that our acquisition workforce has other facets as well, and where they are supporting directly our troops and doing it very well, and in the process of rebuilding an economy in Bosnia and teaching people who had previously suffered under a communist regime about how a democracy worked how the marketplace should work. A very interesting aspect of something else that our workforce is doing. So, I am very pleased to be with you today, and look forward to responding to your questions.
REP. WELDON: Thank you, General.
Thank you both for being here and thank you for your statements and for your work on behalf of this country and before I begin questions, I'd like to introduce our distinguished ranking member who, like our distinguished Chairman, comes to almost every subcommittee hearing that we have, and he's again here, and we'd like to welcome and allow him to make any comments he would like to make, Congressman Ike Skelton.
REP. IKE SKELTON (D-MO): Thank you very much, I appreciate your courtesy.
I still like to ride shotgun, -- (inaudible) -- having been his ranking, I'm just here listening.
REP. WELDON: Thank you, Mr. Skelton.
Mr. Secretary and General, let me start off by talking about the broad based issue of funding levels, and what appears to inequity in the budget request for this year with the Army getting a significantly lower portion of the budget, both in R and D and modernization in comparison to the other services. Now, we're not here to put you on the spot necessarily, but we do need to have a frank, candid discussion, either professionally your opinion, or personally your opinion, so that we take whatever steps we can take in the Congress, to ultimately support your needs, and that can only happen through a frank dialogue.
As you know, there have been statements made by Army officials. I'll use a couple of the quotes. One looking at the defense budget and specifically the R and D budget, made the comment, and I quote, 'We have major problems down range,', end quote. This was a senior Army official, ' an Army slide that's being used in Army briefings says, and I quote, ' The world has changed, the strategy has changed, the requirements have changed, the Army has changed, but the funding paradigm has not changed.', end quote. Another official, when interviewing the three top Army field commanders, characterized our statements to him as, and I quote, 'They think it stinks. They have real problems with it, meaning the Army's budget.', end quote.
Some would say this is caused by maybe the Army not being aggressive enough on the Hill to make its case, which is my own personal opinion. I think the other services fare much better in that regard then -- (inaudible) -- I said that to everyone involved with the Army itself, Others say it is the Defense industry. The Defense industry is so concerned with driving its big ticket programs, that they put the Congress in no position of funding the big glorious programs with the labor union support and the manufacturer's support, sometimes at the expense of the war fighters who are out there responding to all of our needs around the world.
In fact, one recently retired Army official said, and I quote, 'The Defense industry is sabotaging our national defense and dividing the services.' End quote. And to be honest with you, sometimes I don't disagree with that. I think there, in fact, may be some substance to that statement, unfortunately. What's your response? And do you support the statements that have been made by Army officials, both officially in their capacity and perhaps personally if they differ. Are we shortchanging the Army?
MR. OSCAR: Mr. Chairman, there is no doubt in my mind the Army has requirements for a larger budget. It's like running a taxicab fleet and (for naught?). You know, if you have a hundred taxi cabs, if you want to keep the average age of your taxi cabs constant, if each taxi cab lasts ten years, you want to buy ten taxicabs a year. And if you don't buy ten taxicabs this year, next year you got to buy 20. And if you don't keep on buying them, eventually they'll all wear out and you got to buy 100 taxicabs.
Now, if you also want to modernize them a little bit and add a radio or a little GPS to see where they are, you know, a little extra for modernization. Now I've calculated that in terms of the Army, like a big taxi cab fleet, I've added up all our tanks, all our trucks, all our helicopters, and I said, if we want to keep the average age constant, how much money does the Army need? Maybe about nine to ten billion dollars a year. Now, if you want to modernize it, instead of buying the same exact truck, and if you get the latest trucks that ETPA standards or the tanks with the little better run on it, we require about $14 - 15 billion a year.
The Army, as you know, the last couple of years, we had about 6 billion this year, its 99 budget we're presenting today is up a billion to 8.2 billion. So, it's clear we're aiding our fleet.
REP. WELDON: Let me just add that to correct the record, the staff tells me that that one billion dollars includes actually $855 million of what Mr. Hunter said is such a significant portion of that billion dollar plus --
MR. OSCAR: And so there's not doubt that the Army's modernization budget is in stress and that we have moved on into the future a problem. Now, as far as the Navy and Air Force, I'm not an expert on the Navy and Air Force, so it's hard for me to know their needs. I mean, they also have very big needs. I know the Navy at one time had a 600 ship fleet, and now it's smaller and the rate of buying ships between -- (inaudible) -- lasts about 200 years. So, they probably have similar problems . I do know that when I talked to soldiers in the field, in Iraq and Kuwait after Desert Storm, they spoke with pride, but they also kind of laughingly said, how the Army did in a hundred hours what the Air Force couldn't do in a hundred days.
And now when I go to Bosnia, and I see our soldiers on the ground, they tell me they're very proud of what they have done, they have separated these forces, they have stopped the killing. We can't do that with (arcane?) missiles or bombs from B-52's. And so, you know, I don't know the problems, they might have big problems too. I do know that we have, obviously, a lot of requirements.
REP. WELDON: Let me phrase the question differently. It's not, these are additional need for dollars. Every service will come in and tell us there's a need for more money. I'm trying to get at the issue of fairness. Let me use another quote from Army Lieutenant General Richard (Threfy?), who said, and I quote, ' The Army gets 24 percent of the money, they carry 70 percent of the load.', end quote.
My question to you, is the budget for the next fiscal year fair to the Army. Do you feel that you're getting the fair amount of the dollars for R and D in the next fiscal year, in the next five years, in comparison to what the Navy and the Air Force is getting in line with those quotes that I've given to you, from other Army officials. That's what I'm trying to get at, is it fair?
MR. OSCAR: Mr. Chairman, I really can't answer that because I don't know the Navy and Air Force needs. I know my needs and I have big needs and I would love to have a bigger piece of the pie. I assume that the Defense Department has done the same thing I've done, I've had to balance in the Army how much money to put in tanks, how much money to put in helicopters, everybody wants more, and I've kind of come up with the best balance. I assume the Defense Department is doing that too.
REP. WELDON: Let me ask General Kern a question. General Kern, you're the war fighter. You're out there on the line. Is it fair, given the parameters that I just described to you, because it's a real concern in the Congress that we're not being fair to the Army.
MR. KERN: First, I'd have to tell you up front that, one, I count on the Air Force, the Navy, and the Marines to be there and to fight with me. So I don't want to take things away from them. So, the asking of the question is it fair has a lot of different dimensions. I think, my personal opinion is, it's also been reported that the percentages at GDP, which goes to Defense, is below what it should be, and I believe that to be true. So, then how do you divide the pie? I think first, the pie is too small to begin with, and we in the Army suffer from that very much.

Our programs are at the margin, when we are taxed and we take inflation cuts, we find them to be very painful to execute our programs and we have to cut things out rather than push them back in out years. So, from that standpoint, no the Army I don't think is getting all that it needs to meet its full requirements.
REP. WELDON: I understand, and believe me, this committee shares your concern. The GNP defense spending has gone from nine percent to 2.9 percent. In John Kennedy's era, 52 cents for every tax dollar went for the military, in this year's budget it's 16 cents.
The President spoke for 75 minutes in his State of the Union speech, there were exactly two sentences about national security and the military, patting our troops on the back and saying our readiness is ready.
We have those same concerns. But the point is, given the parameters of what we're dealing with dollar wise, we need to hear whether or not you feel you're satisfied. And if you do that, then in fact, we'll continue to support the requests that have been given us. But I have the distinct impression, and maybe it's wrong, in listening to comments made by senior Army officials, both recently retired and current, that we're not being fair. And that's what I'm trying to get at, sir, that's the reason why I'm, I'm not trying to, I am trying to box you in -- I shouldn't say I'm not -- I am trying to box you in to be honest with you, and have you say what I think is , in fact, supports the problem, and to help you get more money.
Let me ask one more question, because we have a lot of members here. The supporting leap ahead technology development, I note the Army's request is only the size it is because or transfers of defense wide programs such as $54.4 million for strategic environmental research and development program to the R and D account. It's also very disturbing to find that the Army's second largest R and D expenditure is a support $300 million of base operations. That's not exactly a leap ahead technology. How can the Army develop leap ahead technology and systems and digitize the force under such severe fiscal restraints? Doesn't R and D require reliable and increasing funding to support development advanced systems to be procured for the future, for the Army after next?
MR. OSCAR: Mr. Chairman, we have tried to balance our R and D versus our procurement. Our R and D a couple of years ago was about 5 billion, and our procurement was about 6. Ten years ago, we had a ratio of about one to three, we had about three times the procurement as we did R and D. In the last two years, it's only been a one to one. And it's concerned us a great deal, because we have no procurement money to buy what comes out of research and development. And so, we've tried to get a better balance. We think our budgets in pretty good balance. Would we like more, of course we would.
But we have very exciting technologies and programs in our tech base, and we have (really less?) than that in development. We do not have the money in procurement to buy all of that. So to put money and balance more money into tech base and to research I think would create in a pipeline where we couldn't afford to buy. We kind of got to balance the aging weapons today and the technology to make the best balance we can.
We had, I believe, many items in technology, I mean, -- (inaudible) -- six-one budget, continues to go up at real, real growth. It is essentially going up every year, and we've been protecting that. So we've been purposely trying to protect our research to make sure we take advantage of opportunity.
REP. WELDON: Would you agree, Mr. Secretary, that the $300 million of base operations should not be in the R and D account money?
MR. OSCAR: Yes, sir.
I would support a move to put that into (ULMA?) funding. It's more an isolated area where we do base outside of R and D, it'd be much better to have it all in ULMA. Often when we switch back and forth you lose, no matter which way you switch. At one time it wasn't ULMA and you moved some to R and D, and we lost some. I'd like the fact in ULMA that I don't want to lose -- (inaudible) --
REP. WELDON: General, do you have any other comments?
MR. KERN: Well, I would just add that we are learning to use the dollars that we do have very efficiently. That has been one of the real challenges for us, to make sure that we don't waste R and D dollars, we don't waste procurement dollars. An example is, a Commanche program is flying with one prototype, the development effort was done exceedingly well down in (Grayfield?) in simulation, and we can still continue to do that. So one of the pressures is teaching us to be very efficient.
REP. WELDON: Mr. Hunter.
REP. HUNTER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Incidentally, all the quotes that you made, and I think in the statements that our references are made, I'm appreciative of. I think we're at a time, we have a difficult, I was just getting a little litany from the staff, a description of a number of uniformed officers who, because of their statements in publications, have to go through the Secretary and get taken to task for saying that the country needs more defense. Those things happen, those times happen. And we've had some great soldiers who have fallen on their swords in terms of talking about the need for military readiness.
I was playing poker last night with Charlie Bass, who's great uncle is (Billy Mitchell?) and Billy, you know, told us a lot of things with respect to air power that we needed in the 1920's, we court-martialed him for it, but we needed that air power, and to some degree he woke the country up. This is a difficult time for you folks in uniform, because you see a lot of deficiencies that you want to address, and sometimes there are repercussions, just like those repercussions for us, with things that we say in the political forum.
But thank you for saying them, and in my recommendation to every uniformed officer is be candid, always be candid with respect to the military needs of the country, because one thing that (Curt?) said often, and I think Norm Sisisky mentioned it one time too, is the fact that if you don't say that we need something, and we put it in the bill, the editorial writers around the country say there goes that dog-gone Congress again, putting in things that the military doesn't want.
And we know that you want it often, because you told us you want it in the confines of offices, but you haven't said it on the record, so the system is set up so that sometimes a number of us have to take a great deal of pain. And this is a painful time for a lot of military people, but my kudos for the military leadership that is coming forward, that is saying we can't cut anymore, and we've cut too much, and we need to replenish funds here and here and here.
Mr. Chairman, I've got just a couple of questions here. Let me ask you about the Department of the Army and the National Guard's intent to re-engine approximately 130 Vietnam-era Huey type helicopters with T801 engines. That, hopefully, helps us fulfill its requirements for a light utility helicopter. What are your plans?
MR. OSCAR: Mr. Hunter, we are trying to help the Commanche helicopter. The Commanche helicopter, as most airplanes, has an engine development that's usually separate, but in parallel to the main part of the helicopter. The T800 engine is an engine we developed for the Commanche helicopter. The engine is almost ready in the helicopter because of funding cuts in the past, it's been slowed and won't be ready for awhile so we had this gap. We've got the engines ready and what do we do with them.
Now the T-800 engine is a marvelous engine. You could take the whole thing apart with a couple wrenches. It was designed to have low operation per costs and very powerful. The National Guard offered to us and said we'll buy some of these engines and put them in some of our old helicopters because that will help our own (net?) costs and that'll allow you to test them because you need the helicopters to test them in. We will then give them back to you.
Essentially what were doing is the National Guard is reloaning the engine so to speak to the Guard. We're reducing our own net costs and we're getting a test of an engine and then we'll be able to mate it up with a Commanche and they'll give us the engines back. Separate from all that, we are looking very seriously of what to do about out our Huey fleet. Our Huey fleet is fading quite a bit and we need to do something about it. We're looking at several options to upgrade the Huey, to perhaps buy a commercial light detailing helicopter. We're looking at all those options. But the purpose of this engine was not to upgrade the Huey, it was strictly to solve a near-term problem in the Commanche helicopter, how to test these engines.
REP. HUNTER: Okay. Longbow Apache. Is it adequately funded?
MR. OSCAR : Yes, sir. It's a marvelous weapon. It's a leap ahead technology.
It's one of our highest priorities in the Army. If the radar that keys in on top of the helicopter and even allows it to fire and forget the missiles and have them honing in on a target which is a marvelous technology and it is funded. I don't know of any funding problems.
MR. KERN: The Longbow is fully funded but I will tell you that it's funded right at the margin. So that when there are adjustments to be made to the program and it was across the board, we took reductions in fiscal year '98 and both here and in inflation reduction. And when you compare that to the inflation indices, which were negotiated in multi-year contract, we're right at the margin right now. So while the program is adequately funded, I will tell you that there is no extra money whatsoever in that program and some of the work is being done in later years which could be done today.
REP. HUNTER: Okay.
MR. OSCAR: I might add this is an area where you could help us. For a long time, Congress would decrement a certain program and then for a while you kind of decremented, not attached but allowed us to figure out where to put the decrement. Recently, the last two years, Congress has put a decrement that demanded that it go equally for each program until some programs like Apache, for example, we have flying multi-air contracts. And then we have to by law take a certain decrement out of every program equally. That then often causes us to perhaps break that multi-year and have a tremendous penalty. So if there is a choice and you're not an undistributed decrement, it would be really preferably just to make it undistributed and allow us some flexibility where to put it.
REP. HUNTER: Okay.
REP. WELDON: Could you yield a minute, sir?
REP. HUNTER: Certainly.
REP. WELDON: To follow up Mr. Hunter's question about Longbow Apaches, there's an article running in today's defense daily which basically says in an effort to deal with short fall in the resources the Army is considering (shrinking the?) number of Boeing, Longbow Apaches, considering slowing initial production of the Commanche and considering slowing the CH-47 -- (inaudible) --improved helicopter which indicates to me you don't have enough money. Is this article wrong?
MR. OSCAR: Yes, sir.
(Cross talk.)
REP. WELDON: -- (Inaudible) --subscriptions to all those magazine and save money but --
MR. OSCAR: It's excluding internal Army documents. That's wrong. Our budget, as General Kerns said, supports these aircraft. We have Commanche and Apache funded. I would like more but they are funded out in the future.
REP. WELDON: But you're not slowing them down from what you initially told us?
MR. OSCAR.: No, we have not.
REP. WELDON: You're contracted for that.
MR. OSCAR: Okay.
REP. HUNTER: That's all questions, Mr. Chairman.
REP. WELDON: Mr. Pickett.
REP. PICKETT: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Welcome gentlemen. I think the Commanche's a good example of a sort of leap ahead, sort of kind of technology we like to see particularly for the Army. I don't know that this can be a possibility but if you did get additional funding for the Commanche program, how would you propose to use these monies?
MR. OSCAR: Okay. What I'd like to do first is explain again that we have balanced our program as best we can with the resources we have.
REP. PICKETT: I'm putting you on the spot.
MR. OSCAR: No. I'm going to answer your question and very honestly and straightforward I'll tell you exactly how much and where but I want to tell you first that we have balanced our budget the best we can. I mean, I can't by all tanks and not buy any clothing for our soldiers. I can't not modernize my trucks so I've kind of taken the money and we've got a really good balance I think. So the air balanced budget agreement, our theory really here is that some of us are getting more here and we lose it there and undo all this balancing that we did so we this fear. Now that that money came from somewhere else, I'll have General Kern tell you exactly where to put it. (Laughter.) Your ball. MR. KERN: Clearly one of the issues that you know is that we have only one prototype (fine?). We have another prototype which is being assembled today so if we were given additional funds that's one of the areas that we would put it. How much does it cost to get another prototype flying? Our estimate right now and I'll tell you it's a very crude estimate because we have not looked at that at this point and it is about $25 million to get it up and to sustain it for a year.
The other part that we would put our -- that we would like to do would be to accelerate the mission package that goes on board the Commanche fell off. Sometimes you may consider whether or not we would ask for multiple six or seven more prototypes and we feel it would be more beneficial to put that into acceleration of the mission package so that we knew in fact that we had a more capable aircraft. And I would really have to go back and take a look and provide for the record but that would be the take to do it.
REP. PICKETT: I'd appreciate that for the record, please.
MR. KERN: We'll do that, sir. The last piece that we would consider under Commanche program would be accelerating the introduction of the Longbow. When we originally developed the Commanche helicopter, the Longbow technology, you know, was not there. We've incorporated that now but it does not cut in until later into the production so that would be the third area that we would consider for acceleration. Again, I would have to look at any problem where you would want to do that, provide that information for the record, sir.
REP. PICKETT: And also, I understand that the Commanche can't even theoretically get into the Army war fighting experiments such as the Vision 2000 because they don't have the simulation technology developed. Is this a fact and if so what does it take to get this aircraft into the fight here?
MR. KERN: We are looking at that right now. Our goal is to put the first complete division on the ground in the year 2000. And that's the time then that we would like the first prototype Commanches to be able to work with us in the testing of doing that. We are looking at the pros and cons right now, a couple of different alternatives of how best to do that and I'd be -- I really don't have a final answer that I could give you right now but yes there is more work that needs to get done to bring it in to that 2000 time frame for the complete digital package.
REP. PICKETT: Do you know what that would cost? Do you have a cost analysis of that?
MR. KERN: Sir, I do not have that with me. I'll provide that for the record.

REP. PICKETT: Okay, thank you. Just a final question about the Commanche because I think that there's something. We're on the right track and I hope you don't get slowed down anymore in getting this feeling that collateral technology in the developing of the Commanche that need to be brought up to speed that you could use some money on.
MR.KERN: On Commanche? -- (Inaudible) --.
(Cross talk.)
REP. PICKETT: To go on systems to go on that helicopter.
MR. KERN: Yes. I mentioned the three areas I think that give us the most concern right now as to where additional R & D investments would be made in that particular program. And you mentioned the fourth theory where additional technology work would be done to ensure that we have a fully compatible with our force 21-digitization efforts. Included in that mission package, there is a lot of technology work which is being done in the helmet mounted displays and how that is tied into our entire display work which is one of the areas where technology is moving that we'd like to -- perhaps Chief Armbrust is very familiar with that might comment on that particular area.
MR. ARMBRUST: Yes, sir. The comment not in display technology is not on the prototype right now. We're not doing any development with that actually on the air vehicle. We use a great deal of simulation and lab work to develop it. And it is a fairly significant feature because unlike other helicopters that will be our primary flight display will be painted in front of our eyes. They won't even -- there aren't any gauges in the helicopter like in a typical airplane. Everything's there. So it's very critical piece of the pie that we don't have in the aircraft right now in the prototype. None of the drivers, none of the computers are there, none of the sensor systems or images -- (inaudible) -- are in the prototype, right now.
REP. PICKETT: While you've got the mike, could you just tell the committee fairly briefly how you feel about this, about the Commanche? I know you've seen a lot of different kinds of helicopters and --
MR. ARMBRUST: Yes, sir. I should start off by saying that my experience comes from the older era of scout models, the OH-58 A's and C's; I flew a UH-1 in January so that's still not gone after 20 years. And I also fly apaches. Most of my test work is in Apaches prior to -- actually that's my current (space?). With the Commanche, I should point out that Air Vehicle One is undergoing structural envelope expansion which means we're just trying to make sure that all the big parts stay on so that we can start doing some of the other development work. So we're very early on in the program that the aircraft only has I believe about 72 flight hours on it right now.
I am part, from the army test organization, have been assigned there to work with the contractors. There's only four of us pilots. It's kind of a, for lack of a better word, kind of a back yard operation, we've got there. There's just the four of us, two -- (inaudible) -- one Boeing, and myself. There's a handful of engineers. We do have a nice room that we work in and there's also -- (inaudible) --and we've got the instrumentation posts. And they do fight well, I believe, with what we've got to work with. The aircraft itself is progressing quite nicely. If you look at any program, take any successful field of system like a Blackhawk or an Apache or something, it's doing quite well for us now and go back and look at their first 60 or 70 hours, you'll find that we've done quite well.
We got out to our maximum level flight air speed, about a 167 knots of true air speed, which is faster than any helicopter in the Army fleet right now in 58 hours after the first flight which is pretty remarkable. As a program, it's going technically as a program; it's going quite well. There aren't any major glitches, we've got the usual stuff that comes up. There aren't any major problems with it and they really are trying to take a big step ahead here and some of this stuff frankly, for those of us who've been in the business for a while -- (inaudible) --, the flight control system is a huge departure from the standard or conventional flight control system in a helicopter.
What they were trying to accomplish was when I would fly scouts, I'd say about 70 percent of my time I would devote to just keeping the greasy side down, watch out for the tree, don't hit the wire, just manipulating the flight controls to maintain control of the aircraft. That only left about 30 percent of my attention to devote to whatever it was I was doing in the case of a -- (inaudible) -- tactical operation or in a battle, directing Cobras to bring in their fire, conducting a joint air attack team, calling in A-10 support and organizing it so that when the A-10 leaves the artillery lands and the when the artillery quits the Cobras are up and they're firing. Thirty percent, 70 percent which fly an aircraft.
The flight control that they develop or trying to, is trying to actually try to reverse that number so that they only spend about 30 percent of your time actually manipulating the aircraft which means that you get to be a soldier for 70 percent of your time out there managing the battlefield. Tremendous risk and frankly from the first flight on, it turned out that the area that we was most concerned about flight control loss has been a flawless performance and I think it's been due mainly to modeling and simulation that we've done ahead of time and analysis that got us to that first cut. Yeah, there's some adjustments we have to make but as a broad first cut it worked out quite well.
REP. PICKETT: Well, thank you very much. I appreciate that. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
REP. WELDON: Thank you, Mr. Pickett and thank you for those -- (inaudible) --. Mr. Sisisky.

REP. SISISKY (D-VA): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You heard me in my opening remarks talk about legacy weapons and what do you really deploy. Then you said that the Apache, for instance and I use the example of the Cobra verses the Apache is at a marginal level and maybe rather than modernize the Cobra you're better off using the money to get the Apache out of the mode of being a marginal funded weapon. Is there any truth in that all we deploy -- if you were a CINC, would you deploy a Cobra rather than an Apache?
MR. OSCAR: The answer is no I would not. In general, you can not aleve instantaneously put a new weapon in cause you only have so many dollars. You got a thousand old weapons and now you want to buy new ones. Well, you can't just buy a thousand new ones cause you don't have the money. So you have to continue maintaining your thousand old ones and you still need to buy new ones and as you buy new ones you washed out the old ones and at some point in time you hope you've washed out all the old ones and you've got all new ones. And you try to balance this with a thousand different weapons simultaneously, washing out old ones, putting in new ones, upgrading some, and I think we've done a good job of that. To my knowledge though, we don't have any Cobras in the active force.
REP. SISISKY: Well you talk about -- when the Chairman asked the question about the T-801 engine, you talked about putting those on National Guard helicopters I think.
MR. OSCAR: We've given Apaches to the National Guard. I think the Marine Corps has Cobras.
REP. SISISKY: I'll tell you what got my attention really -- it was just two months ago I'm reading, picking up the Sunday paper and why I didn't cut it out I never know Virginia National Guard had 30 helicopters in Richmond. I think half of them could not carry any troops because they weren't safe. The other half they didn't have the fuel to use it. I mean it's nice to send helicopters but you got to send money to do the trading of it, too. I mean this is ludicrous. This is what I'm talking about. We could send all the equipment that you want to send. But unless you send the training dollars, so these people can use it, it's of no use and all I'm saying is that maybe we need to look at the modernization dollars in order to buy the equipment that you really would like to have.
I mean, I understand that you have so much and you can't go too far but it would be interesting if you could do a study and I'm not demanding a study here now but see what this would really buy if you just backed off and say we're not going to modernize these Vietnam era helicopters. You know, it's like a truck. If you've got a 25 year old truck, I will bet you that you probably spend as much and I won't bet you cause I don't know -- (inaudible) -- but you probably spend as much repairing that truck or add of use to that truck as it would cost for a new one. Is that fair?

MR. OSCAR: It does go up drastically. We've plotted an example are two and a half and five ton trucks and their own -- (inaudible) -- costs just like your own automobile is kind of, it's pretty flat and it slowly rises and then toward the end it takes off as you got to rebuild your engine or something. And we have in the Army washed out old trucks. At the same time, we don't enough money to buy new trucks so we bought some new trucks and remodeled some old trucks and washed out the real old trucks and we tried to keep this whole thing going. The trucks are a wonderful example.
We have 100,000 trucks and it's a big demand and they're getting a lot of mileage and we can not afford with the money we have to completely buy new trucks. So, in the truck area we do what you say, we have A rebuild program on some of the newer trucks and buy newer trucks and try to wash out the old trucks.
(Crosstalk.)
REP. SISISKY: -- what it would cost a new truck versus fixing a twenty-five -- you know, figure out how many --
(Break in tape.)
MR. OSCAR: I can get you the data, sir, for the record. But we don't spend more in maintenance than we do buying new.
REP. SISISKY: The reason I ask you, the largest item in the veto of the MILCON budget was something I had in there, it was at a Navy shipyard, it was a demolition basically and it paid for itself in two years. It was in the -- (inaudible) -- of 2001 and I figured anything that can pay for itself in two years, is a pretty good deal, plus, it would make 48 -- it was $20 million but it would make $48 million in ten years. I'd say, well that's a good business proposition. So, I added it on and OMB thought that was a lousy thing so they vetoed it.
But, that's why I'm saying, you know -- like I know -- I get all the time, we got to run the Department of Defense like a business. No business has a Board of Directors of 535 people and political decisions are made and I understand that. But, there are some common sense approaches that perhaps we could make. And I think of using legacy systems and I know we don't like to get rid of them and maybe sometimes your better off without a lot of them, if you're never going to deploy and just use it for training you may be better off without it and use simulators.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
REP. WELDON: Thank you, Mr. Sisisky.
The distinguished chairman of full committee, Mr. Spence. REP. FLOYD SPENCE (R-SC): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me thank you two gentleman for coming today to help us with our immediate problems.
Could someone tell me what the status is of the (M4 Car Beam Contract ?)?
MR. OSCAR: Yes, sir. That is on track. We have signed a multi year contract. We've redone our Patton Licensing Intellectual Property Agreement. There was some concern awhile back of a misunderstanding between us and Cole (ph) on the licensing agreement and whether the licensing agreement meant that the government had the right to compete the item or not. We have sense redone that licensing agreement to clarify and we have not signed up an MO memorandum agreement with them that we would buy this item and honor of this licensing agreement to the year 2011. And so, we have signed up with them to go so source the code to buy the car beam to 2011. They've agreed to that and we've agreed to buy the car beams we need from them.
REP. SPENCE: I see, thank you.
One other thing, one of the favorite subjects, the chairman of the subcommittee and a lot of us have is National Missile Defense. And I'm always looking for a new way that the problems being approached and I see in your the statement here reference made to the National Missile Defense. Let me kind of point out the way this thing's worded and let you explain it to me a little bit better.
First of all, we say that -- you say that our nation has always been vulnerable to long range ballistic missile attack, always vulnerable. And then you skip down and say, this program is highly evolutionary and flexible to allow us to respond to a strategic missile threat as it emerges.
Well, how can we always be vulnerable right now and then talk about when it emerges we're going to be responsive to it. And from a standpoint of emerging, would you say that China's long-range ballistic missile system has not emerged as a threat?
I'm always trying to get somebody to explain to me how you can word these things a different way to avoid providing us with a National Missile Defense, and this is a new one right here, I won't you to explain that, if you could, a little bit better to me.
MR. OSCAR: I haven't read the article, but, my interpretation of it from what you've read is that we have a threat and it might get worse.
It's saying we have a threat and then their saying there's more emerging, so over time that threat might get worse. That's how I interpret that, we have a threat today and it might continue to grow and get worse as other countries come on line with that kind of capability. REP. SPENCE: Other countries, but China's already on line.
MR. OSCAR: There's no doubt that there's countries today that can threaten the United States, I agree with that.
REP. SPENCE: And then we talk about that we're gonna provide the option for initial capability in 2003 if directed and funded in 2000. That's the other part I left for the last part, after saying that we're are vulnerable to missile attack and then we talk about that we must pay now to defend ourselves against such a potential in the 21st century, and the potential is already here. That's what I can't say one thing in one sentence and then negate that in the next sentence, that's what always worries me.
What do you think about it?
REP. WELDON: If the gentleman would yield, he's right on the mark. I mean, you can't say your gonna prepare for an emerging threat if the threat's already here. And I think the chairman's point is well taken, does China have long-range missiles right now, I think you all know the answer to that? If they do, then that's a threat today.
MR. KERN: Sir, if I could comment. The Army takes that land base mission of ours to protect the nation very seriously and we see National Missile Defense as an Army mission. As we have taken a look at future options as to how we would employ our Army National Guard, that is one of the missions that we look at as a very serious mission for them to be able to take on.
The Army this year, stood up as a command at Space and Missile Defense Command that General Anderson commands with the purpose of being able to look at our space base requirements and our ability to protect the homeland. We feel in the Army, as our most direct threat clearly, the tactical ballistic missile systems which we are providing defenses against, and I think your very familiar with the programs we have under development and right now with the Patriot Pack Three, the -- (inaudible) -- program for high altitude and for the MEAD program for the mobile forces.
But, General Cosumano in an Army officer who is running the program right now for General Lyles, whom you know very well in the National Missile Defense, and we stay very close with the work he's doing and are very much concerned with that threat. The budget this year from the Quadrennial Defense review, did increase our investment in that area. So, we see that threat and we take it very seriously.
REP. SPENCE: I won't belabor it, I just wanted to see what new way we have of explaining this same way.
REP. WELDON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, we'll now go to committee members under the five minute rule. Our first member is Mr. Bartlett from Maryland. REP. ROSCOE BARTLETT (R-MD): Thank you very much and welcome to our committee.
Returning to the Commanche (ph) development, how much is Commanche development compromised by having only one prototype, that seems to me, awfully thin.
MR. OSCAR: It slows down the development, there's no doubt about it. When you have a test incident, a generator fails, you don't have another one you can switch over and fly to, so it definitely slows down the program. And, the program was funded at a larger level at one point in time, and due to funding problems in the Department of Defense, it was cut, and so we've had to kind of scrape by. And I think that's one of the reasons it gets fielded in 206 where our core is getting fielded the digitized core in 204. So, we'd much rather those match up in time so we could start fielding the helicopter in time for a core, it does slow the program down.
REP. BARTLETT: Is it too late now to fix that problem?
MR. OSCAR: No it isn't.
There's still time left to be able to catch up and marry those dates up.
REP. BARTLETT: Thank you very much.
I'd like to turn now to another area that I have some concerns about and this is the area of nuclear chem-bio. In that regard, if it's appropriate, I'd like to wish a happy birthday to Dr. Ted Prosif (ph) today. I understand that he's now beginning the second half of his century with us, happy birthday, sir.
I have two concerns relative to this area. One is that the asymmetric threat that chem-bio now presents, I'm wondering if having chem-bio, which is really kind of subordinate because the nuclear is so big, of having it bundled under nuclear does justice to the importance of this program. And from my personal perspective, I think that our nation might be better served in chem-bio where standing alone because I think it deserves that kind of visibility.
And the second concern I have is that the defense reform initiative has essentially disassembled the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical and Biological and office title that we created by statute just last year. I represent Fort Detrick where most of the bio-defense work is done.
My question is will the new OSD structure offer sufficient visibility so that chem-bio issues will be advocated appropriately in OSD or should chem-bio be devolved to the Army where I think the issue might be more effectively pursued?
MR. OSCAR: The Army as you know has treated chem-bio separately from nuclear. We manage it separately we execute separately. You were right, it was together at OSD. OSD is now looking to devolve many things. The devolved the chemical (demil ?) and they devolve that and given that to the Army.
They retaining a small chemical biological office that will look at policy and over see that. And so I think over time, you will see the Army not only executing, but being in charge of the program as a lead element for OSD.
We stand ready to that and we're organizing to do that. We have established Dr. Prosif as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army, and we have plans to put that all together and manage it as one piece over time.
REP. BARTLETT: You do not now have that responsibility that you predict it will be devolved to you?
MR. OSCAR: We do not now have it all. They've only devolved the chem. demil, we do execute for them though, the chem-bio defense in a joint fashion for all three services.
REP. BARTLETT: But they are establishing policy?
MR. OSCAR: Yes they are.
MR. KERN: Sir, can I add that we have asked for congressional approval on that evolvement as well and that that has been the recommendation of OSD the data be moved and it was so proposed in this years budget. Now but, along with that is request for legislation to approve that change.
REP. BARTLETT: You need action from us for that to be implemented?
MR. OSCAR: Yes, sir.
REP. BARTLETT: Thank you very much.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
REP.WELDON: Thank you, Mr. Bartlett.

Mr. Snyder.
REP. VIC SNYDER (D-AR): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I want to ask just a question on one topic and that's the (Singars ?) radio or whatever you call them, the communication system. To try and get in a round about way, as Mr. Hunter was talking about the draw down and the procurement budget and starting with the high point was '84 Congresses fiscal year '85 and then you had the drop off over the next eight or nine years every year, actually over three presidents.
And I guess most of us, as a first year member, I have been assuming that that was really hitting in terms of big ticket items, missiles, new lines of planes and so on. But, as I've gone around to my National Guard and Reserve units, with regards to funding levels for the Singars, is there a problem or would you just give me your sense of where we're at with regards to ability of enhance reggaes if they were to be called out tomorrow, their ability over the next few years for them to communicate with the active units because of the different versions of the Singars. And, is our funding adequate to get them in line at some point?
I mean, this is something I heard from the active Army assigned to the guards. What's your equipment needs if you were called up tomorrow, and they're concerned that their going to get called out and not be able to communicate effectively?
Now, I've talked to some folks with a lot of stars on their shoulders that think that that's not a problem. But, I'm wondering if it's perhaps going back to some times when they were in the field that it wasn't a problem, but with the new digitization that your talking about, do we have a real problem in the ability to communicate between our guard units and our active units because of different versions of Singars, which gets down to procurement, is the funding adequate for the next few years to get that in line as quickly as possible?
MR. KERN: I'll comment on the fielding part of it, sir. I went to desert storm with BRC 12 series of radios and other units there were equipped with Singars radios. We were able to clearly communicate through other channels and that was not a problem.
So, the Army has worked with this high/low mix of radios throughout its history.
REP. SNYDER: Let me interrupt if I can. But you're moving into an era that I thought your whole point is that I can never say the word digitization, so you'll have to help me. But, I mean, it's my understanding you've got the four different, as you move into the (Singars?) and it's SIP, or S-I-P, or that that puts us into the problem. I mean, you're kind of like me. I still think junior high's look like when I was in junior high. I think that you've moved into a different era now, have you not, and if you're going to equip the Guards with the (ICOM?) units and you have your active units with the more advanced versions, isn't that where the problem comes? That's not the same as when you were in Desert Storm?
MR. KERN: Potentially we could create that problem if we are not careful.
But we are looking at that today to see how we interface between, we're going to have that case throughout the Army as we digitize the units and we will have, within Army organizations, some that are and some that are not. Active and reserve components and coalition forces as well as we're constructed, so we are looking very carefully today at how we build that bridge between units with dissimilar communications platforms that are part of the organization. But as I mentioned, that's been part of the problem that the Army has always been able to do because we've never been able to field, literally, the hundreds of thousands of radios that we'd need, all at the same time. I would offer to for Doctor Oscar to comment, but then we also have our expert here on communications is General Campbell.
MR. SNYDER: If I can just make a comment, then any other comments you want to make. I mean, part of this business of, you know, as I've read over some of the division statements that you all have put out in the National Defense Panel. I mean the whole business of technological change, though, I mean the fear is that technology changes so rapidly that if we fall behind with the rapidity of change that we will leave ourselves vulnerable. And so we may not have the luxury anymore of doing the same, I guess what you call a washout, where we will gradually bring in the new radios and let the old radios go out. It may have to be a fairly dramatic leapfrog, or the whole digitization thing will leave us vulnerable, rather than being an improvement.
MR. OSCAR: Yes, we are actually working on that. The Defense Department asked the Army, because of its expertise in radios and communications and digitization, to lead a program for the next generation joint tactical radio for all three services. We are putting together a consortium of industry to look at where the technology's going. What are the standards, how can we make a modular radio much like this modular panel here in Commanche? So not only do we have modular hardware, but we'll have modular software and we'll be able to insert software in different wave forms.
But to do that, we need to get industry to agree on certain standards, just like you have a Beta or VHS kind of tape recorder deal, and so we're working with industry. They're very confident that in the next six months we'll be able to create this long-term architecture and buy radios that we'll be able to modularly switch out. In the meantime, as General Kern said, we've been trying the old fashioned way, make new generations of radios that are kind of backward compatible or can communicate with certain (minds?). I don't know the details on Singars and perhaps General Campbell can fill us in on that.
MR. CAMPBELL: Yeah. Sir, I believe I can shed light on that question. We have under contract now with 60,000 Singars radios with the Systems Improvement Program, the SIP that you mentioned earlier. That includes something called an Internet controller that provides us the capability to do digitization. We require in a division, approximately 5000 of those radios in order to have the enabling infrastructure of the tactical Internet.
Currently we do not have quantities on order of the Singars radios to equip all three components of the National Guard, the Reserve and the active Army with the new radios. Nor do we have enough on order with that improvement, that Internet controller, to replace all of the older versions of Singars that are in the active force. Our posture over the next several years will be 60,000 radios, which would be about 12 division-equivalents, which would have the basic infrastructure necessary for digitization.
And as Dr. Oscar mentioned, rather than going back and taking those legacy radios and upgrading all of those, we're putting our funds on the joint tactical radio, which will provide us not only with the infrastructure for digitization, but will give us the ability to inter-operate with the allies, and with the other services much better than we have today. And so it's really, I think, comes down to a question of, if we're going to deploy a force, what we have to do is allocate radios from within the quantities that we've bought. We have, for example, just sent over to the Gulf, 125 Singars to flesh- out the ground force that's over there.
REP. SNYDER: My time is up, General Campbell, but the concern expressed by the young officers I talked to, apparently that is a legitimate concern.
MR. CAMPBELL: That's correct. It's an issue, largely, of timing, and of strategies for when we cut off the current version of the radio and when we build the next version. And our strategy was to go with 60,000 of the improved Singars radios and then, for the rest of the force, cut over to the next generation joint tactical radio and migrate in that direction.
MR. SNYDER: I don't have an experiential base on this kind of thing. I just know that when businesses decide to put in a new computer system, they replace, everybody gets the new system. It may be that if we're trying to head to this in the military we may have to look at a different way of funding these kinds of changes and say it's time for the new change. And we can't have three generations of what we're callings, still calling a radio out there, when we may leave some units, you know, in the dark out there by mistake.

REP. SNYDER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
REP. WELDON: Thank you, Mr. Snyder.
Mr. Bateman.
REP. HERBERT H. BATEMAN (R-VA): Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome Dr. Oscar and General Kern. Appreciate your testimony. Dr. Oscar, when I get a little better acquainted with some of the information that's just come into my office, I'll probably be corresponding with you about some precision-guided ammunition that, I think, the Army is, or should be, or might be, interested in. Frankly, I don't know enough about it to ask you the questions today.
Let me just make an observation that relates to your analogy of the taxicab company in the Bronx. If that taxicab company in the Bronx operates the way we, apparently, are operating now, and if we continue to operate much longer, it isn't going to be in the business in the Bronx. Because it isn't replacing its equipment, it isn't even able to maintain the equipment it's got and it's not taking advantages of the technology or developing the technology that it's going to need. So all of this is a matter of real alarm and, of course, I'm not saying this in the context of being critical of you or the Army in the way you are balancing that budget. I have the greatest sympathy for you. And I guess I'll just conclude by saying I hope we've convinced you that you need more money.
REP. WELDON: Thank you, Mr. Bateman.
Mr. Riley.
REP. BOB RILEY (R-AL): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Gentlemen, welcome. Got a statement with a few questions.
Dr. Oscar, the fiscal year 1998 Conference Report authorizing statutory language, $35.2 million of a total of 40.2 million (dollars) authorized to be provided for A-3 modifications and upgrades to the M- 113 carrier, which was a $20 million congressional increase over the budget request. However, report language included in the fiscal year '98 appropriations Conference Report directed that 15 of the 20 million plus of it, be used for competitive procurement of reactive (tiles?). The statutory language should prevail since the authorization act was the last of the two bills enacted and allowed the Army to use the $5 million difference to procure additional upgrade kits of other types of equipment for the M-113 A-3.
ROPYEL (sp), an Israeli firm, produces reactive armor tiles that have been applied to the Bradley Fighting Vehicles as an emergency requirement for deployment to Bosnia. The firm requested a congressional plus of 20 million in fiscal year '98 for tiles to the M-113. However, the Army has previously stated that it has no requirement for reactive tiles on the M-113. Additionally, the Army has previously stated the M-113 performance would be severely degraded if these tiles were applied to the currently configured vehicle, due to the added weight.
So my questions are does the Army intend to follow the law as specified in the 1998 Authorization bill, with respect to the A-3 upgrades of the M-113?
MR. OSCAR: Yes, sir. We have an urgent requirement to upgrade our M-113 fleet. It's very old; it cannot keep up. We need to re- engine it, put better suspensions in and whatnot. We have a requirement on the books to upgrade over 2000 of them. We're way short.
We intend to follow the authorization language that directs us to take the additional 15 million (dollars) I believe and upgrade those. And we will do that.
REP. RILEY: What will you do with the additional $5 million, the difference between the 15 and the five, or the 20? Will that other five go for additional upgrades or for reactive tiles?
MR. OSCAR: We're looking at that. Right now the Army has no requirement for tiles because the majority of these M-113's are in rear areas. There are a few, however, that do, in the engineer area, go up close to harms way. So we're looking at whether or not it would be feasible to put tiles on the M-113. I doubt it would be feasible to put them on M-113's that aren't upgraded, because the reason we're upgrading them is they can't go now. And so, it might, perhaps, be feasible to put them on upgraded 113's that are in certain areas for the engineers. So we're looking to do that, at how to do that.
I think we may do a study or a little analysis to figure out how to do that. We haven't decided yet. We're in discussions with a lot of people on this issue. I don't think we can procure them directly. I think some research, or R&D, development anyway, has to be done just like it was done on Bradley to figure out how to mount them, what's the best way to mount them on that surface, how to put them on. And so we may do a study with some of that money. Not the 15 million (dollars) that we're using for upgrades, but we may work out some way to maybe take some of the other 5 million (dollars) and maybe move a little of that to R&D to see how we can study this to see if it might pay off. But we haven't decided on that yet. But we will definitely do the 15 million (dollars) for the upgrade.
REP. RILEY: Okay. As far as the reduction of performance in that system, does the additional weight of those tiles, has it been proven whether or not that is a detriment to the --?
DR. OSCAR: It definitely degrades a vehicle's performance. I do not believe you could put it on the non-upgraded M-113. I think it would so drive it down you'd get tremendous increases in problems with the suspension system, and you'd further degrade the speed. I think you might be able to put it on the upgraded M-113, and that's why we would need to do some studies to see, from an engineering standpoint, could it take the weight, the suspension, and could a new, upgraded one take that. REP. RILEY: Do you have any kind of time-table on when or what the current status is of this program and --?
MR. OSCAR: We're hoping to work it out in the next month or so. And we're looking to engage everybody in that discussion.
REP. RILEY: Well, we look forward to it. Thank you, sir.
REP. WELDON: I thank the gentleman, Mr. Riley.
Mr. Lewis.
REP. RON LEWIS (R-KY): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I just have a couple of questions. The (M-1A2?) tank, I understand, production is going to stop some time around 2007. There's going to be a real gap between then and the next tank that would come on line in the Army after next. Can you give me an idea of what that tank will look like and in the meantime will you be able to keep the M-1A2 upgraded and ready for service in that long gap between the new tank?
MR. OSCAR: Our goal is to continue to be the world leader and have the best tank in the world. I believe we have that now, and our intent is to keep that. We are working on several options in (Tech- Base?), looking at what might the future tank look like. We do not have one selected at this point as the with -- We have several that are competing. Everything from an electric gun, kind of an electric tank, where we would have an electric gun, electric armor, electric suspension, electric propulsion, to a two man tank, to a four man tank, to whether a tank should be about 30 tons, or whether it would be larger and be 60, 70 tons, whether it would have kind of a robotic attachment or a wing man. So, also looking at options of upgrading and modernizing another upgrade, the current M1 tank.
So, we're looking at all these different options. I think you're right on your time estimates, I think these options, we probably will continue on a tech base with these options for another couple of years, and then once we decide, it will probably take another ten years or so to develop such a tank. It's my personal opinion that we're not going to do anything that's going to harm our ability to use tanks in a battlefield. So I believe that we are going to continue to maintain an M1 capable tank until we have a substitute, and then at that point in time we're going to say, well, is that substitute better, and is it worth the price, and is it worth switching? And we'll make that decision at that point in time.
REP. LEWIS: My only concern with that lapse of time, without any production of any tanks, the vendors that supply the parts for the tank, will the parts be available to keep that tank up and going the way it needs to be?

MR. OSCAR: We will come up with a strategy that does that. We will not allow our tank to deteriorate and we will not allow us to go without the capability to maintain and even in certain new technology. I do not see a time when we would just cease everything. I think we will always continue to maintain that capability.
REP. LEWIS: The other question, we've looked at a lot of options, I mean, we've always looked at, you know, when's the best time to switch over --
MR. OSCAR: Right.
REP. LEWIS: I mean, do we do it in 203, do we do it in 206, do we do it in 210, 220? I think it will be farther out, because just in reality of how long it takes us to develop a new tank, it's going to be awhile. In that period, I do not believe we're going to have a gap. We're going to do something, and we keep studying it every year, right now we're funded out through the (palm?), I mean, we're funded out through the budget year to keep on buying, we're upgrading tanks. We haven't bought a new tank, but we've been upgrading to M1A2 (SEP?) capability. And I believe we will continue in some fashion to continue to maintain that tank.
REP.LEWIS: The future (cavalry?) scout vehicle, is that the priority, though, for the Army in the new vehicle coming online, is that as opposed to a new tank?
MR. OSCAR: No, it is not. The scout vehicle is an urgent requirement, it is funded, and as you know, we have a joint program with Great Britain where the 50-50 cost sharing. I think it's a good deal for us and Great Britain. We intend to move forward on that program, but we will not move forward on it at the expense of not having a tank capability.
REP. WELDON: Thank you.
MR. OSCAR: No sense having a scout --
REP. WELDON : Without anything behind it.
MR. OSCAR: -- if you have no tank to follow up with.
REP. LEWIS: Yeah, thanks.
REP. WELDON: Thank you, Mr. Lewis.
The air defense gentleman from Texas, Mr. Reyes.
REP. SILVESTRE REYES (D-TX): Thank you Mr. Chairman, Dr. Oscar. Paul and Bill, good to see you again. I enjoyed my trip down to see the Commanche, and part of what I think I'm trying to understand is that the Army has a history of developing weapons of different kinds that, where you pick up the tab on the front end on the R and D portion, which is the most expensive, you know, in talking to people that are in business, they pro-rate the R and D portion down the road on products.
I'm wondering, particularly as we develop, and it applies to the Commanche as well as the tanks or scouts or Calvary's, or whatever it is that you're developing, that ultimately other branches of the services ultimately incorporate into their arsenal. Is there a way for the Army to recoup the R and D portion, either by weapon or some account, for instance, giving you an example, the Huey as old as it is, is being used by the Navy, it's being used by the Air Force.
I'm sure down the road, whether it's 2004, 2006, when the Commanche's fully developed, the Marines will use it, perhaps the Navy, the rapid deployment forces, whatever. Is there a way to recoup R and D expenditures for the Army account?
MR. OSCAR: That's the best idea I've heard all day. That's one heck of a good idea, I love it. Yeah, there is a way to do it. I guess we haven't been agressive enough in talking to our sister services. You're right, we do develop a lot of equipment. Sometimes we share. I know in lightweight 155 Howitzer and the upgrade of the 5-ton truck, we've been sharing the development with the Marine Corp, and then we both purchase it.
But you're right, we've often in the past developed it completely with Army funds and then, I know in the M1 case, not only did we develop it with Army funds, but Congress directed the Army to give the Marine Corp some M1 tanks with the Army money. So, that's a great idea, I will go back and figure out how I can, to try to do that. That's a --
REP. REYES: Well then, I make mention of that because we're all in this together, so we all should share the gain, and we all should share the pain. And when I read articles that point out that the Army receives 24 percent of the budget and carries 70 percent of the load, it just makes sense from a business perspective to have other agencies or other branches pay into an R and D account for the Army because ultimately they're going to benefit by the Comanche, by the M1, by the M4, whatever weapons you are developing that ultimately, and obviously to us it doesn't make any difference who develops the weapon, as long as our soldiers, sailors, and air men are provided for and protected.
But yet, when you're talking in this kind of an environment, where every penny counts and when you have this kind of, from the Army perspective, disparity in the budget, it just would make sense to make an argument that part of recouping the R and D portion, which is very expensive, we might want to think along those lines.
MR. OSCAR: I will certainly look at it. I know we do take our requirement documents from each of the three services, and now they go up to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and they look at them for joint application. It's in that process where they say, like on UAV's or something, that should be joint or tactical radios, and they establish a joint office, and we all work together.
There are instances when that, perhaps, hasn't worked as well as it should. I will look into it.
REP. REYES: The other thing, just for the record, as it relates to (MEADS?). I just want you to share with us, how important that piece of theatre missile defense is to the Army modernization, and to our maneuver forces, in your opinion?
MR. OSCAR: It's a very big requirement for the Army. It not only gives us the mobility to our maneuver forces, but it is really the best weapon to defend ourselves, not only against air and tactical missiles, but against cruise missiles, slow flying, various kinds of cruise missiles that are a growing threat around the world. So it is a big requirement for the Army.
REP. REYES: One last thing, and this is fronted by the comment that you made in answering my colleague's question about the timeframe of whether it's too late to actually be in the position to deploy by 2004. What would it take say, for instance, if we were to prioritize immediately, the Commanche program to be able to catch up? What would it take?
MR. OSCAR: I don't have a dollar number -- you know, I'll have to provide them for the record.
REP. REYES: I would be interested in seeing the -- thank you Mr. Chairman.
REP. WELDON: Thank you, Mr. Reyes.
Mr. Mchale.
REP. PAUL MCHALE (D-PA): Thank you Mr. Chairman.
Dr. Oscar, I don't want to be overly combative by seizing on it, what was obviously an aside in your testimony a couple of moments ago, but I think the record has to be clear. I led the effort to transfer those tanks to the Marine Corp, and I did so for good reason. Fourteen hundred tanks were coming back from Western Europe.
All of those tanks M1-A1's were scheduled to go to the National Guard, the active duty Marine Corps was to stand in line behind the National Guard. And Army argued at that point that they could not afford to take 132 of those tanks and transfer them to the active Marine Corps, where there was a severe deficiency at that point. Ultimately, this committee, and the Congress did insist on that transfer, but the overwhelming balance of those tanks did indeed go to the Army, and to the National Guard.

The reason why this is a particular sore point for me, is that four years later the most senior Army officers came to me and without any ironic sense of historic context, argued that those same guard units should no longer get any tanks, but in fact the very tanks they insisted the Guard needed were in their opinion unnecessary, and too expensive to maintain.
And so over a four period of time, when they first argued against what was really a relatively moderate tank transfer, they ultimately came to the conclusion that none of those tanks should have gone to the Guard. I disagree with that conclusion, and I'm pleased that the overwhelming balance of those tanks did go to the Guard, but that's the historic record. And so when we start talking about the cost of development, and a transfer of Marine Corp at Army expense, I think the facts need to be clearer. If I can bring things down to a (unwelcome?) response, if you choose to make one, but we have to be cautious about some of those asides. Let me bring things down to a grunt level if I may.
MR. OSCAR: I will comment to you that 134 tanks sounds like a small number, but it's probably $750 million, which more money than the Army has today.
REP. MCHALE: It's not the Army's money, it's the nation's money.
MR. OSCAR: That's true. And the irony is that just four years later, senior Army officers, all of flag rank, came to me and argued without any reference to the debate that took place four years earlier, that the real mistake, they believed, was that any of those tanks went to the Guard, and that the Guard should go light, rather than armored, in the over all total force Army. A complete reversal of position over a four year period of time.
REP. MCHALE: My question, series of questions, bring things back down to a grunt level, are we issuing our soldiers waterproof boots? And if not, why not? The fact here is they're obviously available on the civilian market.
MR. KERN: We issue a number of different types of boots, based on the environment that soldiers will be working in. The basic issue of boot, leather, or canvas boot is not waterproof. But we can add waterproofing to that. Clearly the sole of our boot is waterproof.
REP. MCHALE: I understand.
MR. KERN: Those boots are widely available on the civilian market, I don't know that they would be practical for a wide range of environments, but it's something we ought to look at. Obviously, in most environments, have great benefits the individual soldier. We do have a cold wet weather boot that we do --
REP. MCHALE: I'm familiar with that. You walk into almost any sporting goods store, and you can find a very fine quality boot with a Gore-Tex liner that provides complete breathability, combined with waterproof characteristics, and for that soldier that's out there carrying a pack and riffle, back gear, and in most cases, and in most environments, would be a dramatic improvement. When are we going to replace the M-16A2 as the standard issue riffle?
MR. OSCAR: We have in our development now, a new weapon that has several contractors in a competitive mode coming in with different versions for our final one. I think after testing, I think it's with the other date, it will be several years yet, but I can get you the exact date if you'd like for the record.
REP. MCHALE: I would welcome that. When was the last time that we had a systematic review of the standard issue first aid kit. And again, I maybe going off on a bit of a tangent here, but that kit I think has remained pretty much the same in its configuration over a long period of time.
There have been relatively inexpensive and insignificant improvements in technology. For instance, the FDA recently approved a medicinal quality super glue, basically the same thing you buy on the commercial market, in lieu of traditional sutures, have we thought all about looking at the contents of that kit? Similarly there are water purification tablets that address the issue of (geodiasis?), those tablets have come onto the market in recent years, again walk into any back packing store, and you can find them. Have we really taken a look at the first aid to see if it might be improved?
MR. OSCAR: Yes we have. And we're doing extensive work at that right here actually, at Fort Detrick (ph) Maryland, I was up there about six months ago, and you're looking at all of the medical supplies, not only the first aid kits, but the greens, and there are the water, the blood gizmos, the little telecommunication, the little cameras in the helmets to radio back, to kind of digitize the soldiers, so the doctor can talk to the paramedic and see the patient. And they do have a new kit that's already laid out, and I expect within the next year or so they'll put into --
REP. MCHALE: Let me applaud that, and let me specifically raise of that super glue. Again, I'm a lay person, but I have some experience with those kits, and it seems to me that would be a relatively inexpensive way of providing at least on a battlefield a first aid response without sutures to for instance a scrap metal wound.
One final question, if I may, my light just changed. Obviously, we would like our infantry to have a full nighttime capability. Are we moving toward the point where we would issue, particularly to every infantryman, (MVG's?) or an advanced equipment of that capability?
MR. OSCAR: We agree that seeing in the dark is one of the major advantages of the US Army over most armies. We have bought expensive goggles of various kinds and generations. As a matter of fact, it's one of the success stories that we have that we've driven the price down on many thousands of dollars to now it's about 6,000 (dollars).
We also have an experimental program going on with them to exchange old ones to allow them to sell them commercially, and give us discounts on new ones, it's very exciting. To my knowledge, we have dramatically increased, we have brought out all of the goggles in our original plan, we have relooked at that, we have significantly increased our requirements for goggles. And we are now increasing our buys to match that.
REP. MCHALE: I praise that after on the part of the Army, and I think you've done a terrific job. I guess what I'm really looking for is, when do you anticipate that every infantryman serving in the United States Army will have a night fighting capability based on MVG's, or some advance in technology that is the equivalent?
MR. OSCAR: To my knowledge, we have created a number of goggles we needed to ensure every fighter who needs one in the situation, has one. That doesn't mean that every soldier in the Army has one sometimes, but it means that people that are going to do it in a battle, at that point and time do. There's also other means we have most of our weapons now have infrared sights on them.
MR. KERN: If I could just comment.
REP. MCHALE: Yes, please.
MR. KERN: We have created the program manager for the soldier, the individual soldier, and he is looking, and has been working very hard to bring a lot of the comments that you've made into the kick back as far as soldiers today. Looking at commercial capabilities and integrating them into it as soon as possible, looking at a complete ensemble that gives them night fighting capability is part of that. And we are looking at trying to also be able to couple that with our digital efforts, so that the communications between soldiers becomes part of the kit that they wear.
That's a very successful program right now. Night vision goggles presents another set of problems, because it's not just the infantryman that needs it, we have a, perhaps a very critical part that we also look at in all the people who are driving supplies and trucks behind the lines. So the magnitude of that when you look at it in an entire Army active and reserve components, is considerable. And one of the real challenges that has been mentioned earlier, is this is the technology which moves very quickly right now, to make sure that we are getting the best out to all of those soldiers.
REP. MCHALE: The obvious question is define that as a goal, where we work with you to achieve the result that every soldier in the 21st century is a night fighter. I think we need to keep that in mind. We do have the gear now to issue on a periodic basis within a given area of operation. I think it ought to be a goal of the United States Army that every soldier is a night fighter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
REP. WELDON: Thank you, Mr. McHale.
Mr. Thornberry.
REP. WILLIAM M. THORNBERRY (R-TX): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me start out by asking you all about the medium truck program. Because it does seem as thought every year that I've been here, the Army comes up and talks about what a central pieces of equipment the trucks are, how we're short, and then we look at your requests this year, and as I understand it, we're spitting out about 300 of these a month now, and your request will result in about 170 a month, so the production is going to go down.
We have the capability now to spit out about something like 500 a month, and if we need them that bad, why are we not buying them at a more economical rate, and a quicker rate? And the second part of that question is, I understand that you all have indicated that you want to go get a second source for them, why? Is that more efficient? Does that result in trucks being delivered to the soldiers and the people that need them quicker, which is what you all tell us every year that you want to do.
MR. OSCAR: On the first part of your question, trucks are very essential to the Army, and we have long recognized that our trucks have been aging. And not only aging in time, but with all these exercises aging in mileage. We, as I've said before, have tried to balance our budget. We've got a lot of things that are aging, and we've tried to get the best balance of our budget to keep a capability today, and out into the future.
In the truck case, we have both gone into a program to rebuild existing five-ton and two and a half-ton trucks, and we are purchasing new trucks (FMTV?) trucks, both five and two and a half-ton. We have, as you note in this budget, we have increased from about 250 million to 350 million the money we're putting in in '99, our '99 budget, and it keeps going up in the future.
So we are ramping up the dollars in our trucks, so that we can get it from a minimum sustaining rate more up into a -- actually below a minimum sustaining rate, up into more closer to a more economical rate, but it's impossible for us to do that in every area. We have many things in the Army, critical things, that are below a good economic rate, but we cannot afford to get them all up into a good economical rate because if we get this truck up into an economical rate, then I don't have any money for my humvees, or I don't have any money for my heavy trucks.
So we're doing the best we can to balance that. As far as the second part of your question on why competition. First of all, it's the Competition and Contracting Act and this Congress has requested in particular on trucks, that we look at that very seriously, and we have. We will be buying a medium family of trucks for well over 20 years. We had a five-year multi year on trucks, we've just signed another four year with an option year for an multi year on trucks, so we'll go out for another five years. When that is over, we will still be buying over $12.3 billion dollars worth of trucks. Now many people say that competition can gain you 10, 15 percent. Well let's forget that, let's say it's only 1, 2, 3 percent. If it was just one- percent savings, of $12.3 billion dollars, you would save $123 million again to competition.
REP. THORNBERRY: If you have your folks have prepared cost benefit analysis of how the second sourcing would play out over time, I'd appreciate receiving a copy, and I know the committee would appreciate it too, because we could be talking about significant dollars in an extended period of time. And I think we'd like to see what analysis you go through to see that. I just have as an aside, it worries me that as a result of trying to balance everything out, we produce nothing at the economical rate. I think back about the radio line of questions that Mr. Schneider was asking. You know, so we do everything slowly, and uneconomically, and results in the worst of all worlds but let me go ahead.
(CROSS TALK)
MR. OSCAR: It bothers me, too. Not only does it bother me, but we have, and have, killed many programs. And it's bothered us to the point where we've said jeez, we ought to kill some things and buy some things at economical rates. But we've killed one heck of a lot of programs. Flat out dead. Armor and gun systems, all kinds of programs we killed. But our budget's gone down 70 percent. And so we're doing the best we can with what we have.
REP. THORNBERRY: I realize some of these problems are resulted from decisions made at a paygrade above your alls, but it concerns us, a lot. Let me shift gears a little bit and give you a chance to reassure me some. The rap that one hears often on the Army is that it is the slowest and most reluctant branch of the Service to change, and to transform itself into the kind of military that we may need in the future. A lot of folks look at Force 21 and say at best, it's a modest effort, but question whether we're really even getting moving towards Force 21 at the pace we need to.
When one looks at the R&D budget for the Army this year, we see it go down slightly, we see it much less or significantly less than the R&D budget for the other services. As I understand it, the second biggest item in the R&D budget has to do with base operations, or something. I am very concerned about our ability to leap ahead, to have the Army after next to meet the kinds of challenges we're going to face in the future. And so I guess I'd like for you to reassure me a little bit that, this year, our priorities are right, that we are putting the R&D into the areas that are going to make the most difference in the future. And that secondly, from your perspective, that the Army is committed to undergoing, sometimes, what are painful decisions to transform itself to meet the challenges ahead. And if you've got obstacles that you can identify where we can help you do that, I'd like to hear that as well.
MR. OSCAR: I'd like to comment and then have General Kern comment, also, from a military perspective. I am exceedingly proud of our Army and how it has adapted and actually led change. And two areas I just want to briefly cover and then turn it over to General Kern. Without question in my mind, the Army not only leads all services in all nations, but all companies, in our grasp of information management and simulation. The fact that we have developed new ways of designing our force, that within a couple of months we are going to be announcing a new structure for our divisions, a new number of tanks, completely reorganize our divisions and how they fight, new doctrine. The fact that we have embraced information management and that we're quote, 'digitizing this force,' unquote, so that it's almost like Zen, like my eyes and your eyes are one eye, that we're putting all our sensors together and that Doctor Perry and Mr. Collin (sp) have complimented the Army.
The Quadrennial Review has said I have seen the future, and you're it. They have gone to the other Services and said how come you're not moving out in information management. We have accelerated this pace of change and actually at the Quadrennial Review's urging and our own urging, we have moved ahead our target so we can digitize a division by '00 and a corps by '04. At the same time we're doing that, we've changed all our processes. We have led, not only the Army and the other services, but all federal government, in acquisition reform. We have more credit cards than any federal agency. We started Alternative Dispute Resolution and then the President made an Executive Order for all other federal agencies to do it. We changed our debriefing processes. We created a single process initiative with other federal agencies and companies. I think there is no question that we're out in front of acquisition reform, of change of our practices, (spiral?) development, of what we're doing in information management. I think we're not out in front of marketing. And we do, in my judgement, a real poor job of that.
General Kern?
MR. KERN: I would second what Dr. Oscar said. We are working very hard today to change the Army, to do exactly what you asked so that we are ready for the 21st century. And I believe that we have made significant progress in the last two years. In particular, in identifying how we can use the information technology with our current weapons systems, and we are working very hard today to ensure that the Tech-Base effort that we put through the (ATTD's?) which we are using as well as some very basic research, is focused on those things which are going to be required for the Army after next.

General Hartsog (sp) in his studies, has told us to move to the year 2025 and look back and to take the intellectual to lead the technological changes that we need, and that is what we are doing today with our science and technology base. The science and technology objectives that we're using in Army Science Board work, the National Academy of Sciences are all helping the Army to ensure that the Tech-Base effort does bring us a very high reliable ultra-fast Army into the 21st century. We are doing those things coupled with industry changes, so a great deal of the work that we are using, not only leverages our on Tech-Base efforts, but leverages what is being done in a commercial world so that we are not duplicating that effort, but in fact, using those dollars efficiently to produce a 21st century Army.
As mentioned, we'll be coming out with a new division design for our Mechanized and Armored Divisions shortly. We are starting to do the experimental work on what the light divisions will look like. We're doing that with a Rapid-Force Projection Initiative this summer, an ACTD. We will follow that with some light divisional experiments, coupled with the Marine Corps. We are also working that then towards the Army after next as Doctor Oscar had mentioned earlier with the Second Armored Cavalry Regiment when it gets back from Bosnia. So the Army is moving ahead to the 21st century, both in the science and technology areas, leveraging the commercial world, using our intellectual capabilities to define the environment that we will fight in for the 21st century.
(CROSS TALK)
REP. THORNBERRY: Excuse me, if somebody could, in the process, could comment on the research budget, too, I'd like to know about how you feel about the priorities there and whether that's really moving ahead like we need to?
MR. OSCAR: I'd like to just make a quick comment and then ask for more on that. But General Kern mentioned ACTDs. There's been some confusion about ACTDs sometimes, but I think it's a way that we've created, to not only do leading edge research and then involve our soldiers not only in a testing, but a longer time evaluation of that equipment. But at the same time, they have that equipment over that two, three-year period, they have a go-to-war capability. And as a matter of fact, we've, in Korea, for example, we've done that and we're leaving. We have equipment in Korea that protects against missile strikes. And so I think the ACTD process has helped us capture that technology and put it in the hands of the soldiers very rapidly. I'd ask General Campbell to add a comment on that.
MR. CAMPBELL: Sir, you ask how you could help. I have two fundamental concerns with our ability to accelerate the process along the lines that you suggested. The first is a continuing question about why the Army needs the first digitized division by the year '00, and it's usually cast in the context of what type of threat do we face. The real issue is about re-engineering the Army, about introducing information-age technology into the forces in sufficient numbers soon enough that we can create the doctrine, the organization, the tactics, techniques and procedures, in order to truly leap ahead, and to break that paradigm that you mentioned earlier about the perception of moving too slowly.
The second area that we have some very deep concerns about is the way the budgetary process works. When we balanced our budget, balanced our investment strategy this year, we made decisions to unfund things in order to add money to the digitization program.
We get feedback that where we have an increase from '98 to '99, or where there's been an increase in last year's projection for '99 to this year's projection, that those funds are prime candidates to become bill payers for other projects when the appropriation and authorization process takes place. Whatever you could do to protect those funds that we put on digitization for the Army's 21st century Army, would really help us to transform the process, accelerate our process of change, along the lines that you suggested.
MR. OSCAR: If you would permit, I'd also like our chief scientist to address the research part of your question. Dr. Fenner (sp) Milke (sp).
MR. MILKE: You asked the question about our research. We are focusing our 6-1 and 6-2 accounts on the Army after next vision. In the 6-1 arena, it's largely a question of establishing focused strategic research objectives. And in the 6-2 arena, I'm proud to say that after many years of decline, we now have a four- percent real growth between '98 and '99 and the support of that modest increase is extremely important to obtain the objectives that you've discussed.
REP. REYES: Mr. Chairman, can I say something?
REP. WELDON: You have to ask the gentleman if he will yield to you.
REP. REYES: Will you yield 30 seconds?
REP. : Absolutely. I've used far more time than my five minutes.
REP. REYES: Well, I just wanted to say that this is a lot like that old saying that you're up to your butt in alligators and you forget that the original intent was to drain the swamp. I think we've got a situation here where the Army is, according to what we're reading, is doing 70 percent of what's expected of the military with only 24 percent of the budget. We need to keep that in perspective and work towards a bigger budget for our military, and I think that's the bottom line.
REP. WELDON: That's exactly what we're trying to get the Army to say today, to my friend and colleague, with some difficulty, I might add. Mr. Ryun.
REP. JIM RYUN (R-KS): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The QDR assumes that the future Army modernization plans depend upon a cut in personnel. However the QDR finds that these cuts will still fall short of providing adequate funds for Army modernization. Now last year Congressman Reyes, who had that great swamp analogy and 60 other colleagues signed on to a letter to Secretary Cohen outlining our opposition to cuts in the Army in-strength. Still my position that as long as the Army continues to have such a high OPS Tempo, there's no room, really, for any kind of cuts. Assuming that Congress does not grant the Army relief from current in-strength force, how much extra funding will be needed to fulfill the Army's modernization plan?
MR. OSCAR: The Army modernization plan requires about $15 billion a year to stop the aging of equipment and to modernize at the same time. It requires $15 billion a year. That's what we need.
(CROSS TALK)
MR. : -- and it'll slowly grow.
REP. RYUN: Well I have a follow-up to that. I know that one of our recent briefings indicated to us that the Abrams (sp) tank, I believe, was one that we're looking at modernizing, that that particular briefing indicated that perhaps once we modernized we may still be a step behind the world. What is given for consideration for research and design and not just modernizing, but perhaps looking even further ahead?
MR. OSCAR: We have some exciting programs in a Tech-Base, looking at whole new waves of tanks. Matter of fact, we had a competition a year or so ago across the United States with private industry and universities on designing a new tank. And we had several that looked very attractive. We've kind of (necked?) them down to about three or four. One is an all electric tank. We will have an electric gun that would dramatically increase its fire capability. But it would be all electric. It would have electric drive for better traction and cut down on fuel consumption and it would have electric armor, electric suspension to allow it to go faster.
There's also a two-man tank. Matter of fact, we had a display out at the Pentagon about six months ago, where a tank automotive command brought in a two-man design of a tank, rather than a four-man design and it was targeted to be about 30 tons instead of 70 tons. It relied, because it only had two men, it had a lot less armor that you needed. It had the same armor, but it had a lot of active protection and stealthiness (sp) to it. So we have a number of programs in Tech- Base. They will take a while to mature, but we have a number that we're looking at to keep ahead of the threatening tanks.

MR. KERN: Can I comment on that? I have some love for tanks in my life. I would argue, first, that the M1-A2 is the best tank in the world. And I don't think I would find too many takers who want to stand on the other end of it. But the problem that I think that the Army faces is how do we resource enough of M1-A2 tanks, not whether it's the best tank in the world or not. And we know how to make it better, with the technologies that Doctor Oscar described. So the challenge to the Army in that case is what we're going to be able to resource, not the fact that we don't have the best technology.
REP. RYUN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
REP. WELDON: Thank you, Mr. Ryun.
REP. REYES: Let's talk missile defense. Last year this committee zeroed out funding for the (MIAD's?) program. You testified today that MIAD's extremely important for the layered defense system that the Army's a part of. And I know it's important to the allies working on it. My understanding is you've requested about 43 to 45 million (dollars) for MIADs. Was the commitment that we've now relinquished and backed off and supported the program because the Administration and the Army feel it's so critical. What are the plans for the out- year funding for MIADs? Could you tell me what the dollar amount requested is for the out-years after this next year?
MR. OSCAR: We had to provide it for the record. We have -
REP. REYES: You have it with you? Great. What's the actual number?
MR. KERN: There is no funding beyond fiscal year '99 for the MIADs program. We have fully funded the development effort of the MIADs program, a joint program which we are working with the Germans and the Italians. That program is a program managed and operated under the Ballistic Missile Defense Office and the program funding for the procurement in the future of that program will be one which will be argued in this years' program, as we go from a development program into a decision whether we go into a procurement program.
REP. WELDON: But my point is that we've just heard that it's a priority for the Army and the soldier and yet it doesn't matter whether it's -- (inaudible) -- or the Army, nobody's requesting funds for the out years.
MR. OSCAR: Not in this years' budget, sir.
REP. WELDON: One of our concerns on this committee is the largest loss of life from one incident that we've seen this decade, was when our soldiers were killed in that SCUD attack in Saudi Arabia. And seven years after that SCUD attack took place, we're not much better off today in terms of preparation than we were then. If we'd have gone to war in Iraq, we would have had the (PAC II?), which gives us some improvement, but I would argue that Iraq has not been sitting still. We've seen guidance systems transferred from Russia to Iraq and they probably enhanced their capability.
That's why we're so concerned. Let's talk about the President's speech a year ago when he went before (APACK?) nationally, pounded his fist on the dais and said we're going to defend the people of Israel and support them in adequate missile defense. We're going to build and help build the (Nautilus?) program. We got no funding request last year from the Administration, whatsoever, for the (sell?) program. Zero, nada. We had to get the dollar amount from APACK, which is $45 million.
How much of your request for the Nautilus or sell program this year?
MR. OSCAR: Zero.
REP. WELDON: Was that zero?
MR. OSCAR: Zero.
REP. WELDON: Yeah. I mean is there any reason why we, in this committee and the Congress really feel that there's not a commitment on the part of this Administration to robust missile defense? We saw games played with the (FAD?) funding. In fact, during the mark-up process last year between when we went on the floor and out of committee and the conference, we had the number changed on us three times. We in the committee didn't know what you wanted for FAD. It was $200 million cut.
Then it was a $100 million cut. We just questioned this administration's to programs that the Army oversees relative to missiles. Let me say, I spent some time at Fort Bliss. You have outstanding people there, doing outstanding work, who are proud of what they're doing. It offends me, as the Chairman of one of our subcommittees that I don't see us supporting that effort. I mean, I see a lot of lip service, I see a lot of saber-rattling, pounding our fists on the dais, and when it comes down to nut-cutting time, I don't see the commitment there.
Let's talk about PAC III. When do you expect to have, and I know you're the program manager for this, but really these are in some cases, moldy service programs. When do we expect to have PAC III available now?
MR. KERN: Sir, we are, as you know, scheduled to do the PAC III intercept shoot hopefully in May.
REP. : May.
(CROSS TALK)
REP. : -- is still what, fourth quarter of '99?
MR. KERN: Yes, sir. We are looking at that in the month of May. We will go into a low-rate production following that. As you know, the program is designed so that the configuration, which is on the ground today for the launchers, has already been upgraded to the configuration to, and ready to accept, those missiles. So what we are working for is that hit-to-kill confirm in the Patriot PAC III in this spring. We will be able to, I feel reasonably confident that will occur. The earlier tests that we've done with Patriot PAC III, it has followed the trajectory exactly as predicted so the missile behavior is doing very well. So following that, the low-rate production decision will be made.
REP. WELDON: Let's talk about THAAD. The next THAAD test, I understand, is still scheduled for May and there's a lot riding on this test, as you know.
MR. KERN: Yes.
REP. : I've asked, and I hope you can cooperate with us to get some of the FAD equipment up on the hill because a lot of members think FAD is just one missile and if we don't have an intercept therefore the program should be cancelled. In fact, for the record, I'd like you to answer a question and I've asked General Reimer, General Lyles and a number of other people.
And that is the rumor mill in the Pentagon is such that there are those who are already planning to reallocate all the FAD dollars, assuming there is not a successful intercept that they would want to cancel the entire program. And I can tell you there's some members on the Hill would probably want to go along with that, especially with the aggressive Navy supporters who want to see Navy lower and upper tier perform the mission that FAD is designed for. Are you aware, first of all, of any rumors to reprogram all FAD money if there's an unsuccessful intercept that's made?
MR. OSCAR: No I'm not. THAAD, in addition, has had many successes. Even though it hasn't had end gain hit to kill yet. We have had many tests. The radar is outstanding; it's the best radar going. It can be useful for upper tier and lower tier. It is outstanding radar. The launcher's good. The test failures we've had have been quality failures. They've been really silly things, a screw here, a bolt there. They haven't caused us any reason to lose our confidence in the fact that we can hit to kill. Matter of fact, (e- wing?) which originally did hit the kill led us on to say hey, this is going to be a real leap ahead. So I don't know of any rumors to do it. We would fight that. We deeply believe this program is a high priority.
REP. WELDON: I want to get into those specific points. In fact, my understanding is of the 12 or so milestones that the FAD program has successfully completed 11. Is that correct?
MR. OSCAR: Yes, sir.
REP. WELDON: So the only thing it hasn't completed is actually the intercept? MR. OSCAR: That's correct.
REP. WELDON: The problem is that members of Congress who are not familiar with the program don't understand that. The media has, to some extent, trivialized the issue that FAD has been a failure. When I went to Fort Bliss, what I suggested there and what I'm suggesting to the Army now, is you need to bring up the FAD radar system, the communi-control system, you need to demonstrate that on the Hill so that members and staffers can see that we already are getting successful benefits out of FAD.
In fact, a piece of legislation that we expect to move through this committee this month, which now has bipartisan support, which was a bill to enhance our short-term capability to deal with the Iranian missile threat, the North Korean missile threat that's here today, or will be here within 12 months. We'll use the FAD radar by putting additional funding in to enhance the capability and the footprint of the PAC III system. So we need to make that case. It's not being made right now. So I guess for the record I should ask you, even if that intercept is unsuccessful, would that be a reason that you would think that we should kill the FAD program?
MR. OSCAR: I do not think so.
REP. WELDON: How short-sighted would that be?
MR. OSCAR: General?
GEN. LYLES: My opinion, that would be significantly short- sighted, because I believe that, as you stated, that has been a very successful program in many dimensions, and that the checkout of the missiles that we've looked at have verified for us that it also has the inherent capability for hit to kill. It is trying to meet an extremely difficult capability in that target set that we are shooting. So, we have not taken a trivial capability to test. We are pushing that capability in both the missile and those command and control and the radar to beyond anything that technology has demonstrated today that's been successful in every aspect with the exception of the end game. And in some cases, it's been as silly as it running out of fuel.
REP. WELDON: And my own feeling is, and I'm going to say this on the record, I think a lot of the fault belongs to the contractor. I think the contractor in the THAD program has not been aggressive in quality control. I think the contractor, who was also doing the PAC III program, has to understand that we're going to hold the contractor firmly accountable for the future operation of the THAD program, and the success of this program.
I mean, we're in a critical time frame now. It's seven years after those young people were killed in the desert. And doggone it, we -- I mean, the problems that have been evidenced by the intercept abilities, as you pointed out, are simple things, in some cases stupid things, that should not have occurred, and they're quality control issues. And so, I think it's important, at least from my standpoint as Chairman of the R&D Committee that I'm holding the contractor accountable for what happens in this program in the short-term in 1990, but also the Army and its aggressive oversight, and its interaction with that contractor, because it is critically important to us this year.
year.
So much so that I'm concerned that if we have an unsuccessful intercept in May, there are going to be many on the Hill calling for the complete elimination of THAD, and some within the administration, I would say to you, will say the same thing.
Mr. Bartlett, you had a comment you wanted to make on this?
REP. BARTLETT: Yes, thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
I come from an R&D background, and I have some very serious questions about the R&D testing in this missile defense development. We have too few tests. We push them too fast. We expect too much of them. You really learn more from a failure than you do from a success, and we need to understand why we do testing. Testing is not to prove that you've done it. Testing is to help you move the development along. And we just need to educate the public, and a lot of the members of Congress as to why one tests, and what you should expect from a test.
You know, this program is going along just fine, but the expectations are that it's going to hit -- if it doesn't hit, somehow the program is a failure. Somehow, Mr. Chairman, we have to be the apostles of change here, and change the thinking about why we do testing. But we have too few tests in this program, and too much is expected of those tests. I just wonder if you would comment, gentlemen?
MR. OSCAR: Mr. Bartlett, Mr. Chairman, I take both of your comments very seriously about how we do this. General Lyles and myself have both met with the senior management from the president and vice presidents of the corporation down, and gone through all of the failures in detail. The reason that this test did not occur this month and has been delayed is because of many of the exact risks that you laid out that we took into account as we looked at this test and the way we were pushing it. So, we are doing end-to-end tests in simulation, checking out that system in great detail with government and contractor engineers looking at it to reduce the risk. We have worked that with our operational testers, and our own analysis capability to make sure that we are taking into account the risk reduction that we do it in before we go to the next test. So, I think you are -- what you have said is accurate, and we are looking at that very seriously today.
REP. WELDON: And I'm going to give every member a chance to ask questions. I know I'm hogging the time here, but I want to just do one other thing on missile defense. We have legislation that I said has strong bipartisan support from this committee, two-thirds or three-fourths of the committee members are cosponsors. It was called Impact '97, introduced last year by myself and Mr. Pickett. We've modified that with the strong support of the minority side. Mr. Spratt has been involved, Mr. Dellums was involved before he left.
We reached a compromise that General Lyles is now supportive of that will authorize $147 million of what we hope will be new money. This new money will go for a joint composite tracking network, remote launch capability, PAC III production enhancements, Arrow interoperability, money for basically giving us capabilities with existing components, but providing a very quick dollar allocation that supports and can enhance our efforts with existing systems and capabilities.
The total value of this, as I said, is $147 million. I met with the Chairman of the Defense Appropriations Committee yesterday. We have a difficult time ahead of us. We're going to try -- we're going to authorize the bill. Markup will be, I think, tentatively around the middle to the end of this month, and hopefully passage out of this committee before the end of the month.
Our goal is to try to get an appropriation. We'd like to get new money because this is a very real threat that was not anticipated. The intelligence community did not let us know until this pass summer that Iran had acquired medium-range missile technology from Russia. We now know the intelligence community has admitted even publicly that that threat could evolve 12 to 18 months from now.
Where you could be of help to us in bringing some new money into the system would be to get the services to come out and strongly support that, to make sure the word goes up through the Pentagon establishment, to the White House for them to match up their rhetoric with action in terms of supporting an attempt in a bipartisan way by this Congress to help us deal with the threat that we see in the short-term, rather than the threat we see coming in the long-term. So, I would just ask you to help us in that regard to help you, and not take money away from other priorities that you've identified for us.
With that, we'll go to -- who's our next member? Okay, what members have questions? Mr. Riley. REP. RILEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Dr. Oscar, while we have the benefit of Dr. Perlson (sp) being here today, I'd like to just get your assessment on where we are on the chemical de-mill program, and then a couple of questions about it.
MR. OSCAR: I'll make some general questions and I'll ask Ted to comment in detail. I'm very pleased with the program. We have two factories that are up and running, the one in Johnston Island has destroyed over 80 percent, I think, of the stockpile there. The one in Utah has destroyed about 10 percent. We have two more plants under construction in Yumatilla (sp) and Aniston. We have another one where the contract has been let for construction and should be awarded very shortly. We have two efforts looking at an alternative way of getting rid of bulk fuel at Aberdeen and Newport. And then we have an exciting program looking at alternative technologies that the Army has gotten a lot of kudos from, actually, from the community. We've involved the community very heavily in this alternative technology process.
So, I'm very pleased to say that I think actually that is one of the reasons that the defense -- Office of the Secretary of Defense wants to devolve it to the Army, that it's now getting mature. It's ongoing. We have plants doing it. Safety is our first concern, and we haven't had a single problem with that. And so, we are destroying this terrible threat, and at the same time doing it in a very good way. And I think it's really maturing well.
REP. RILEY: Dr. Perlson?
MR. PERLSON: Yes. I can only echo what's just been said. I think that the transition to the Army will improve a lot of things, particularly communication and chain of command, the ability to communicate with really the true decision-makers, and get the kinds of things we want to do. I know that one of your concerns, Congressman, of course, is how we can help some of the situations out in the communities where we realize that we're creating quite an impact. We will move some 500 people in, work for 10 years, and move them out. And I assure you we are now looking very hard at how to deal with that issue. We're having a IPT looking at whether we can provide impact statements. We'll have a senior level group meeting here pretty soon to work it out.
out.
And we're going to need some legislative help on this. There is no legislative means by which we can accomplish some of the things we want to do. But we certainly are exhausting all kinds of means to do that.
REP. RILEY: As we move through this, Doctor, and we try to establish a means of providing impact funding for these chemical de-mill communities, just logistically, how you do expect that to take place?
MR. PERLSON: That's the actual subject of the IPT right now. There is, because of various constraints that we have, we're unable to simply provide economic adjustment payments, and things like that, unless we have some legislation, some means to do that. As you know, we were able to do that in the State of Utah, but that's because under the Federal Facilities Compliance Act, they had already enacted local ordinances which required us to do that. So, there's a number of different avenues. Before the end of this fiscal year, we'll be back to you with a recommendation and hopefully some proposed legislation that we'll put through our process.
REP. RILEY: The impact funding that was used in Tuello (sp) was after the plant was up and running and burning. Do you foresee that in this case, or will the monies be available, or should they be available before the final construction of the facility?
MR. PERLSON: Right now, I can't answer that because that right now is exactly what the lawyers are debating as to how do we make these payments. In the case of Utah, it was Utah who had an ordinance that required anyone who was incinerating any kind of material to pay on a volume basis. There are two other incinerators in that area. That ordinance was already on the books. So, in Utah, basically we're providing impact payments based on the volume of material destroyed. We can use other parameters, and that's exactly what the lawyers are looking for.
REP. RILEY: One final question, as far as alternative technology, and you said it was being developed today, for the plants outside of the ones that are being developed now, do you anticipate that being in an alternative technology plan or would it be probably another incinerator?
MR. OSCAR: It really depends. We have some exciting technologies, some of which are pretty -- look pretty mature. We have, I think, seven contractors looking at different alternatives, and we're prepared to go to demonstration on those. And that's -- that's really the question that we'll be looking at, can it be done in time to meet the treaty requirements of '007, 2007. It probably will be able to on the plants we haven't built yet. Whether it would be in time or whether it would be cost-effective, certainly in a place like Johnston Island it wouldn't, we're 90 percent done already. So, some of these places will be done before you could bring on a new technology.
REP. RILEY: What kind of time table do you expect for this alternative technology?
MR. PERLSON: We're going into the demonstration phase with the seven contractors. The demonstration phase will be completed in December, at which point we submit a report to Congress. That report to Congress will have the various time tables. And we anticipate Congress will take 180 days to decide how to proceed at that point, and will make a recommendation. Obviously, we'll work together on that recommendation.
We have some opportunities that are coming out that we're going to look very, very hard at.
REP. RILEY: Mr. Chairman.
REP. WELDON: Thank you. Mr. McHale.
REP. McHale: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Dr. Oscar, you testified that the M-1/A-1, M-1/A-2 tank is the best tank in the world. I agree with that assessment. I remember when General Sullivan was the chief of staff of the Army, he sat almost exactly where you are now. I don't know why I remember it, but I remember him testifying that the M-1/A-2 compared to the M-1/A-1 is 18 percent more lethal. That was the figure they used that day several years ago. Is it correct to say that the M-1/A-1 is the second best tank in the world?
MR. OSCAR: I don't know.
WITNESS: I'd say it.
MR. OSCAR: The M-1/A-1 heavy armor tank with the current munitions and with some proposed munitions that we have that are about ready to go into production, is the most survivable and most lethal tank that's out there. There are others who will claim that they can do it, but they do not have tanks in production and the capabilities that we do. So, if you asked me to go fight a battle in an M-1/A-1 today against anybody else, I'm comfortable with that.
REP. McHale: I concur in that analysis as well. And so, we've got the two best tanks in the world. My question relates to a recent briefing that we received from the National Defense Panel. And my question is not presented with any preconceived notion as to what the answer is. This is not an argumentative question at all. I really don't know.
Let me simply present to you what was told to us by the National Defense Panel during that briefing. They raised the prospect that since we have the two best tanks in the world, that in terms of maximizing procurement dollars, some on the National Defense Panel argued that we should stick with the M-1/A-1. That it's the best there is, and in an environment of relatively low harm or threat, rather than upgrading from the M-1/A-1, the second best tank in the world, to the M-1/A-2, the best tank in the world, they suggest that that money would be better spent moving more rapidly to a new generation of tanks. They had some suggestions as to size and capabilities. But that instead of taking a half-step forward, we ought to take a whole step. That we are secure in our armor capability with the M-1/A-1. And rather than going at great expense to the M-1/A-2, we ought to move to an entirely new generation of armored capability.
I have now idea of whether or not that's a valid approach, but it's one that has been presented to us, and I would welcome your comments.
MR. OSCAR: We are also concerned about that, and we have studied that a great deal. There's two factors that come into play. One is how fast you can bring on such a new tank. We, as I mentioned earlier, have some tanks that are in tech base. But I don't believe we could bring them on in under 10-15 years, and then we'd start production at the rate we typically produce, 100 tanks a year. You know, we have -- it would take us 80 years to switch out the fleet at 100 tanks a year. And so, the second factor is supporting what you have. Why it's the best tank today, will it be the best tank 80 years from now? Probably not. Will it be the best tank 30 years from now? I think the M-1/A-2 will be, but over time the M-1/A-1, which is the predominant part of the fleet, we only have about 1,000 or plan to have about 1,000 A-2s, and only about 6,000 A-1s. I think as we start getting 10-20 years from now, we may not be able to still say we have the first and second best tank in the world. So, I think it's critical that we look at bringing on a new tank. The question is when.
And I don't think we have the technology today that will allow us to leap ahead and immediately do that. I think it's going to take 10 years or so to mature that. And, on the other hand, while we're doing that, we've got to keep supporting the tanks we have. There's also some significant increases between the M-1/A-2, not only the 18 percent fightability, and the M-1. But it provides this digital battlefield.
This new battlefield is very synergistic in capability.
It's sort of like -- and I hate to keep saying this, my friends here are always annoyed when I keep doing it. But it's like an analogy of, I'm hiding behind this tree, and I see the enemy, and my buddy is hiding behind that tree with a different set of eyes, and I call him up and I say, the enemy is coming. And he says, where? And I say, in front of my tree. And he says, what tree are you hiding behind? That communication goes on. Now, you can have a map, and you can see where I am, I can see where my buddy is. When he designates the enemy, I can see where the enemy is. I can help him.
This kind of digitization is going to be I the M-1/A-2 tank. So, while it individually may only be an 18-20 percent increase over the M-1, it has a synergistic effect throughout the battlefield because it provides a thousand more eyes, and a thousand more sensors, and helps the Bradleys and helps the aircraft, and they help each other. And one tank can help defend another tank, which they can't do now. So, while it only has a per vehicle maybe 18 percent, but by getting this digital capability throughout the battlefield, which is going to take the M-1/A-2 tank, you increase the whole force dramatically.
WITNESS: I would just add, I think you probably are keying in on what may be one of the most controversial decisions we have to make in the next few years as we look at the production of the current M-1/A-2 modifications, the mix between the M-1/A-1 with its digital capability with the A-2s, and when we bring on the next -- what we're calling today our future combat system, training indoctrine command today has taken that on as a study that they're working very hard. General Adams will be looking at prioritization among all of those systems that we have to do as we build the next year's program. And that will be front and center as one of the toughest decisions that we make this year.
REP. McHale: We will share, obviously, in that responsibility. I anticipate, based on the briefing that we received from members of the National Defense Panel that one or more members of this committee may well offer amendments during the course of this year's authorization process. As someone who has a completely open mind on this subject, and who really is soliciting your advice and your professional judgment, let me suggest to you that you prepare maybe a five-page point paper for timely distribution, because we are going to confront that issue, I expect. There will be members who, in complete good faith, reach the conclusion that that money is not wisely invested in the M-1/A-1 upgrade, and as I make that decision I would very much like to have in my possession your strongest arguments.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
REP. WELDON: Thank you, Mr. McHale.
Let me just add to this discussion, and we have to be careful because we can't discuss what I'd like to discuss here in open forum. But I've attended two classified briefings on tanks, and while you've made some very provocative statements about our superiority in tanks, I think we ought to have a discussion in a private session with what the Russians are doing, and what's about to come out with the Russians. Because I don't know if I necessarily share the robust nature of our confidence. I'm not saying that we don't have the best, but I'm also aware of what the Russians are about to bring out as well. And we don't want to mislead any of our colleagues in terms of development of new systems like that around the world. And certainly, from what the intelligence community tells us about Russia's technology, it is certainly something that we have to weigh in as a factor.
Let me get into a lead in that you provided for me on my final question, and thank you, Paul, which is, is the Army's second largest weapon system the Crusader, the self-propelled 155 millimeter howitzer replaced the aging Paladin. And I understand you're trying to develop a light transportable system. The Crusader and it's resupply vehicle weigh approximately 60 tons each. The National Defense Panel, which you just alluded to, questioned a large projected Crusader buy, and one NDP member actually went on record as saying, 'It's a fine weapon, but it weighs 70 tons, and has a heavy logistics tail.' Even more to the point, recently a senior Army official stated clearly that the Crusader 'is not an Army-after-next system.'
Since the Crusader deployment began, the Army has more clearly defined its weapons requirements for its Army-after-next. Would it not be best, perhaps, to free up scarce resources by doing as the NDP suggested, and bypass Army 21 systems to directly develop advanced systems for the Army-after-next? I guess what we're saying to you is, the signals are mixed, even within the Army, regarding the Crusader program. So, what's the bottom line?
MR. OSCAR: I don't think the signals are mixed. This is a much more dramatic and easier decision than the M-1 tank that we just discussed about the future versus the present. The Comanche -- the Crusader howitzer is our future. It is a dramatic, not an 18 percent, but about a three-fold increase over our current Paladin. It will allow us either to, with the same lift capability, whether it be sea or air, take and get three times the capability for the same lift, or for the same capability we can have one-third less planes, or take it there.
I think it's a little deceiving sometimes when people talk about weight. Whether the howitzer is 40 tons or 60 tons, you can only put one howitzer in a plane. It really doesn't make a difference. I mean, it's a volume problem not a weight problem. It's a queue problem.
The Crusader will start fielding in about 2006, and it provide a leap of that capability from our current Paladin howitzer in every respect. It goes from instead of 30 kilometer range to 50 kilometer range, instead of two to four rounds per minute, it's 10 to 12 rounds per minute. It has unbelievable increased survivability. It's under armor with its under armor supply vehicle feeding it bullets, or whatever they call them, rounds. So, it's better in survivability, it's better in mobility. One of the key problems we had in the Gulf War was that howitzer's couldn't keep up with the tanks and Bradleys. This one will have the speed and the mobility to do that. So it has increased mobility. It has increased lethality. It has increased survivability. It increases both in a large war or a contingency operation, kind of small war, it solves our strategic lift capability because it lowers the lift. And, too boot all of that, it dramatically lowers our O&S costs because it goes from an eight-gun platoon, eight guns to six guns, and allows us to take one-third of the soldiers out of the force.
REP. WELDON: I appreciate all those comments, and I don't think we have a prototype for the device yet, but be that as it may, does it fit the Army-after-next?
MR. OSCAR: Yes, it does. The Army-after-next focus is on two main criteria. One is increased mobility, both tactically, agility, and strategically, the ability to project the force, and clearly this can do it with one-third the lift. The second thing is logistic support. With the resupply vehicle married up, it allows us to have a continuous supply of rounds to the vehicle in a much better logistics chain. It has modern logistics in it as far as tagging the rounds, tracking the rounds, and putting them into the howitzer. So, I think it does.
I think the comment that TRADOC made was the fact that it will be both. Because it starts fielding in 2006, it will be in the next Army, it will be in a part of the digitized Army. It's also digitized.
But, it only starts fielding in '06, and it continues for 20 years beyond that. So, it will be part of the Army-after-next also.
REP. WELDON: So the comments by this one TRADOC official are basically unfounded, or are they just -- were they taken out of context?
MR. OSCAR: I think they were taken out of context. He was saying, it will be in the next Army, but it will also be in the Army-after-next. Perhaps General Kern (sp).
GEN. KERN: Yes, I would -- what he said was accurate, but it was taken out of context, I think, when -- and amplified to say a pejorative view of the Crusader, which was clearly not meant to be, the Crusader, as Dr. Oscar described, is a tremendously improved capability. We ought to go back and remember how we got to where we are with Crusader. When we returned from the Gulf War, we had an armored systems modernization program of which then the AFAS (sp) was part of. When the Army leadership looked at the world as we saw it at that time, and the environment that we had to fight in, we concluded that the system which we had to put the highest priority on was our artillery system. And so, out of the ASAM program, the Crusader moved to the forefront, and it is our technology carrier for the 21st Century for the ground systems.
Now, having said that, it was designed for Army 21. Army- after-next concepts came about after we developed that Army 21, and the Crusader as a centerpiece of that. So that the comment that was made was focused on the fact that we designed the Crusader to meet an Army 21 requirement. It will be here, however, in the Army-after-next battlefield as clearly a system which will be just being fielded early in the 21st Century. Is it a system which meets all of the requirements, however, of what we see in Army-after-next, those are the technologies which we're trying to develop now. So, yes, it's going to be with us, we believe, for quite some time. It is a critical need for the Army to meet, but we will -- I expect that the 21st Century Army- after-next, somewhere around the year 2025, many of our systems will look quite different than they are today to meet those requirements. So, I expect to see further developments in that area as well.
REP. WELDON: Mr. Bartlett.
REP. BARTLETT: Thank you very much.
Just in closing, I would like to make one observation. Our military is just now beginning to develop the capability to protect themselves against chemical/biological agents. For us back home here, there is zero protection and zero planning. We're living on borrowed time. And I hope that what you're doing in the military can hurry up what really needs to be done for us here. We've been incredibly lucky so far, and by and by this luck is going to run out.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
REP. WELDON: Thank you, Mr. Bartlett. Thanks for sticking around for the entire hearing. We ended votes today at 1:00 and a lot of members took off, but we appreciate you being here and answering your questions for us.
Two additional things I'd like you to comment on, both dealing with enhanced roles the Army is playing domestically in terms of terrorism and incidents involving disasters, involving weapons of mass destruction, issues that are very close to me, not just as a member of this committee but also as a member who works fire and life safety issues nationwide with that group of people.
One is the issue of spectrum and frequency allocation. I'd like you to comment on the record, and so that we have a clear indication of the concerns of the Army about the future use of the spectrum so there's no doubt in the minds of members of Congress that we'd better be careful what we're doing here.
And the second is, in the role I've taken in supporting the Army, and especially the enhanced role of the Guard in terms of training and helping assist our domestic response capabilities nationwide, I want to have you comment on the fact that, again, while the Army and the Guard will play a lead role, and again those people that we need to really fully empower are the first responders, the 1.2 million men and women who are in the 32,000 organized departments across the country in our cities and our counties, 85 percent of whom, I might add, are volunteers.
There's a great deal of concern in the country that the Army is attempting to go in and take over this function. I deal with this all the time. In fact, I'm speaking at two terrorism conferences for them I different parts of the country over the next two months. I need to have the Army reassure the public safety people, because I know this is your feeling, that they are not, in fact, attempting to do that, and that's not a part of what the Army is about.
So if you could comment on that, and the spectrum issue, I'd appreciate it.
MR. OSCAR: I agree with your assessment totally. It is no way our intent that the Guard is going to take over the defense of the -- totally. We are looking at using the Guard. We are setting up 10 regional centers to help assist the state authorities and local people to be able to do this, provide them access to technology, provide them expertise, advice, to help them do this.
I agree totally, we are not trying to take this over from them. We're looking at the Guard to help them, and we're looking from the equipment modernization side to provide the Guard with the equipment that they need to be able to display that and help the local authorities make choices on what to buy, and how to buy, and those kinds of things.
On your first question, again, the Guard is really going to train the trainer kind of concept. They're really out there to figure out how best to do it, and then train the local people in the system as they're needed. On your first -- the next -- the first question, the spectrum, I'd just like to make a general comment and turn it over to General Campbell, who is really the technical expert.
I am very, very concerned. We have a real problem with spectrum just nationally, and then we have the one in the Army. I think we need to figure out a better cost-effective way to do this. We have dire problems, as you know. For just one simple example, GPS, it was created by the military to do a military job. It was found that it has a wonderful civilian application, but we're running out of frequency to do that. At the same time, the thought of 'let's sell frequencies' is a good thought, but as the last auction showed, we didn't get very much money for it. And as we sell it, I'm having to incur costs to redesign radios, to buy more radios. And so, it's costing the government instead of netting the government money.
And so, we need to work out some kind of compromise, and I've proposed that DOD help work with the Department of Commerce and Congress and others, and figure out a way that's a win-win for everybody. Maybe perhaps the military can say, here's the weapons we want to develop, or our needs in radios, and maybe that would entice a contractor to buy the spectrum for that purpose, or maybe we can give the spectrum to a contractor and allow him to develop something for the military, or maybe we should allow the military to bid on it.
I don't know what the solution is, but I know it's a grave concern. And to help articulate that -- REP. WELDON: Before you turn to the General, staff has told me that even potentially, the guidance system for the Patriot system could be impacted by this problem.
So, with that, I would ask for additional comments.
GEN. CAMPBELL: Sir, the spectrum is a national asset. It's absolutely critical for national defense. And we need a national strategy, in my view, to protect it. Tomorrow afternoon, the vice chiefs of staff of the services are meeting with OSD, OMB, and the joint staff on this very issue. The provisions of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 requires the auction of 20 megahertz in that portion of the spectrum that's below 3 gigahertz. That is the prime area for the military spectrum. Currently, in that area, that below 3 gigahertz area, there's only 24 percent of that that's reserved for the military, and more of it is at risk of being sold off.
From the Army perspective alone, we estimate that it would have an impact in dollars, probably about $2 billion. From an operational perspective, we have to do more work and really lay out the impact that the loss of the spectrum would have on our flexibility from an operational -- in an operational context. I believe that, at a minimum, there should be a moratorium on further sell-off of the spectrum until that national strategy has been replaced. And if I had a vote, I would vote for not selling off that current 20 megahertz until feedback is provided by the services, OSD, and the joint staff following the review that's ongoing now.
REP. WELDON: Well, I agree with you. And, unfortunately, in our rush to try to find new sources of revenue, this issue is not just negatively impacting the services, although that its absolutely severe and critical, we've had the same problem with public safety. In fact, I led an effort last year, working with Senator McCain, which we finally got the commission to agree with us on, that we should protect some of the frequency of the spectrum for public safety purposes. I mean, we have situations now where public safety units can't communicate one the other. And there's no available spectrum for them.
So it is a critical issue. But the problem is, it's being lost in the rush to look at revenue, and what you're saying is, it's actually going to become a negative in terms of the military and we've got to make that case. And I hope you can provide for us that data, specifically to the committee, and I'd like to have it personally so that I can speak to the budget people who want to continue to press this issue, and talk about the negative consequences on the defense side.
That's an argument that I don't think we're making loud enough, and well enough. And I'm concerned we may well lose this argument. So, we need to focus on this over the next several months.
MR. OSCAR: Yes, sir.
REP. WELDON: Could you include the ranging requirements for the testing and so forth? Staff says that's another issue.
MR.: Just that you would include the problems that the ranges are having for now and in the future to be able to get the telemetry and what-not that they need in the spectrum.
GEN. CAMPBELL: Yes, indeed. We can show you that in the five bands of this 20 megahertz that we're talking about now, that two of those band are currently used for telemetry. And we'll lay out that impact.
REP. WELDON: Thank you very much. Again, we thank you both for coming and thank all the support personnel for coming, and appreciate your candor and look forward to working with you in what will be a very challenging and difficult year.
The hearing is now adjourned.
