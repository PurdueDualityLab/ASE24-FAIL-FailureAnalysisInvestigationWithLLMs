Calif. Electricity Market Opens

In a quiet room jammed with computers, power companies began buying and selling power Tuesday as California belatedly opened its $28 billion electricity market to competition.
The new era began on the floor of the Power Exchange, a commodities-like market where traders monitored computer screens to match buyers and sellers and establish hourly prices for electricity.
Power sold Tuesday will actually be transmitted to homes and businesses across the state beginning at midnight Wednesday.
''The market in California is open,'' said Dennis Loughridge, chief executive officer of the nonprofit Power Exchange. ''I do believe this to be a historic accomplishment.''
On its first day of operation, the exchange handled about 50 bids representing slightly more than $10 million worth of electricity, or 510,923 megawatt hours, sold at an average wholesale price of $19.73 per megawatt hour.
The volume amounted to 75 percent to 80 percent of the electricity that will be used in California on Wednesday, Loughridge said.
The figures do not include power used by the customers of municipal power companies, which are not subject to deregulation. Municipals represent about 30 percent of the state's customers, but only 20 percent to 25 percent of consumption.
Deregulation of the energy market, designed to force prices down through competition, originally was scheduled to begin on Jan. 1. It was delayed for three months because of glitches in software that enables the exchange to transmit sales information to the independent agency responsible for transmitting electricity from generators to the consumers.
Officials at both agencies said the problems had been resolved during three months of testing.
For residential consumers, the transformation to a competitive market means that they can pick an electricity provider much in the way they now pick a long-distance telephone carrier. In reality, however, few are likely to notice the change. Most new providers entering the California market are focusing their marketing campaigns on big commercial users those with the biggest bills and greatest potential for profit.
Consumers who don't pick a new provider will continue to receive power from their local utility as they did in the past. They also will continue to receive a 10 percent rate reduction that began Jan. 1 as mandated by legislation that moved the state toward deregulation.
The rate reduction will remain in effect for all residential and small business consumers until 2002. Proponents of deregulation contend that rates will drop another 20 percent or more by that time because the utilities will be clear of their so-called stranded costs the cost of unprofitable investments such as nuclear power plants.
