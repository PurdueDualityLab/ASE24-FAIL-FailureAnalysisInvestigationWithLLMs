REP. WELDON: The subcommittee will come to order. This afternoon, the Military Research and Development Subcommittee, the National Security Committee is truly privileged to meet with an honored guest. A man of international reputation, and, perhaps, the next president of Russia, Alexander Lebed. General Lebed has agreed to share with us today, his views and to answer questions on a broad range of issues affecting US/Russian relations and international security, including, for example, the safety of the Russian nuclear arsenal, the condition and stability of the Russian armed forces, and the implications of NATO enlargement. Is the translation working okay? No?
I've had the opportunity for in-depth discussions with General Lebed on three different occasions -- most recently, last evening. Alexander Lebed, who at the age of 47 is relatively youthful, which defines anyone younger than me, has already made his mark on history. In 1992, while commander of the Russian 14th Army, General Lebed, acting largely on his own, and without serious material support or help from Moscow, single-handedly quelled a civil war in the transnester (ph), brought peace to Moldova.
Such an accomplishment would be enough to crown the career of a lifetime. However, just three years later, in 1995, Alexander Lebed's achievements in Moldova and his outspoken criticism of government incompetence and corruptness made him one of the most popular figures in Russia. General Lebed resigned from the military in 1995 to run for president, where he played, perhaps, a pivotal role in history. Many scholars credit Alexander Lebed's critical support of Boris Yeltsen's bid for reelection in a close race against a communist candidate, Gennadi Zyuganov, with preserving Yeltsen's presidency, and, indeed, with saving Russian democracy.
But history was still not done with Alexander Lebed. While serving President Yeltsen as secretary of the Russian Security Counsel, Alexander Lebed, again acting largely on his own, negotiated an end to the bloody war in Chechnya. Thus, a war that the Russian government had been unable to end after several years, Lebed successfully terminated after a few months.
At that time, many astonished critics claimed that Lebed's achievements in Chechnya couldn't be real or lasting, and that region would soon relapse into war, but it is now three years later, and Chechnya is still at peace. Critics of Alexander Lebed often charge that he is no friend to democracy. To this he has made a culling reply, and I quote, 'Russianers support Yeltsin who helped start the war in Moldova; I stopped it. He started the war in Chechnya; I stopped it. Who is the greater democrat then, he or I? Is democracy war or peace? I think it is the latter,' end quote.
Three months after Alexander Lebed entered the war in Chechnya, on October 17, 1996, President Yeltsin dismissed him from the government. Nonetheless, opinion polls show that Lebed remains one of the most popular figures in Russia, and the man who someday, may soon be called upon to lead that still great nation. Today, Alexander Lebed is a candidate for governor of the Krasnoyarsk's Propriety (ph). The election will take place on April 26. If elected, General Lebed would also serve in the Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian Parliament.
As the General said last evening at dinner, Krasnoyarsk is important because Russia is the center of Eurasia, and Krasnoyarsk is the center of Russia. I would wish him good luck, but that might be misconstrued as interference in a strictly internal Russian matter. I wish to impress upon my colleague, the unique opportunity we have today, appearing before us may be the next president of Russia. When listening to what is said in formulating questions, we should keep in mind that Alexander Lebed's personal views may have a decisive barring on the future of US/Russian relations far beyond the rather narrow issue of whether any Russian nuclear weapons are missing, as important at that issue is.
Because the future of Russian democracy is not yet set, and the future of US/Russian relations is still shrouded in uncertainty, meetings like this provide an opportunity for dialog between Americans and Russians are vitally important Trust can be built between the sides only if we talk, and work together, and only if we make a real effort to understand each others problems and perspectives on the world. I'm afraid that our two nations are not making enough effort to understand each other, to reassure each other. On a parliamentary level, working with the Speaker and our colleagues, over the past several years, we have been working to insure closer cooperation between the Congress and the Duma by initiating an ongoing dialog between our two parliaments.
By working to build relationships and developing trusts, we will be able to address difficult issues that exist and will continue to arise. Today that issue is proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to Iran/Iraq. My relationships with Duma leaders have afforded me the opportunity to raise this sensitive, yet vital issue in a non-threatening and cooperative fashion.
As for our Executive Branch, I'm not completely satisfied that the Administration appreciates the potential dangers inherent to NATO enlargement. As worthy as NATO expansion may be, or has done enough to convince Moscow that NATO expansion is no threat to them, by the same token, I am concerned by the Russian government's lack of openness about certain programs that appear to have no other purpose, but preparation for nuclear war. Such as, the mysterious underground facility being constructed in the (Yablonovoi ?) Mountains in Ural.
I'm equally concerned by Moscow's lack of candor about the safety and security of the Russian nuclear arsenal. False reassurances that everything is okay only heighten my alarm, especially when there is so much evidence to the contrary. Allow me to briefly recap the issue of possibly missing nuclear suitcase bombs. In May of 1997, when ranking member Pickett and I were leading a congressional delegation to Russia, we met with General Lebed. We were told that when he was secretary of the Security Counsel, an audit of Russia's nuclear stockpile indicated an apparent inability to account for all of the suitcase size nuclear weapons.
Let me stress, because this has been misconstrued in the American and the Russian media. This was a private meeting between General Lebed and eight members of Congress. There was no effort at that time or later to generate any press in this story, by the General or by members of Congress. And those who have said General Lebed attempted to use this as an opportunity to generate media are patently wrong. The story did not surface in America until two months after our visit, when Sixty Minutes found out about the conversation, and, in fact, did an interview and reported both General Lebed's comment and my comment. But in no way was this meeting an attempt by General Lebed or members of Congress to somehow use this fact to generate a story.
In fact, that issue, itself, was a very small part, perhaps, ten minutes, of a much broader discussion about our relationship from a security standpoint between the US and Russia. This is very important to clarify because the general has been misstated in both the American media and the Russian media, and I want to set the Record straight. The suitcase nuclear weapons, which both the US and Russia produced at one time, were designed for sabotage operations and could be ideal for terrorist attacks.
On October 2, 1997, in a hearing before this same subcommittee, Dr. Alexei Yablokof (sp), internationally respected, scientist and former member of the Russian Security Counsel, supported General Lebed's allegations that Russia had, in fact, manufactured small nuclear weapons, as we had, and that these might, in fact, be missing. Indeed, after Dr. Yablokof returned to Moscow, he was summoned to the Kremlin to meet with senior defense ministry officials, who sought Yablokof's help in drafting a decree to be issued by President Yeltsin.
The decree, as Dr. Yablokof explains it, would admit the existence of these weapons, outline a plan to insure the security of all man-portable nuclear weapons, and order their destruction once they have been accounted for. Although the Russian government initially, officially denied the existence of suitcase-type nuclear weapons, subsequent statements and new stories from Moscow confirm the existence of these weapons and concern about their security, the exact testimony of General Lebed in May of last year.
In fact, during my December 1997 trip to Moscow, in a one-hour meeting with Defense Minister Segeev, he admitted to me that, in fact, Russia does have such man-portable nuclear weapons. And he assured me that they were taking steps to destroy them by the year 2000.
General Lebed, we welcome you, and we thank you for being here. However, before I turn the floor over to you, I want to call upon Mr. Pickett, the ranking democrat on the subcommittee respectfully.
I should point out that Mr. Pickett was a member of our delegation, and co-chaired the meeting with General Lebed, as well as other meetings during our May trip last year. Mr. Pickett.
REP. OWEN B. PICKETT (D-VA): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I join you in welcoming our special guests today, and are going to be a witness for our committee. I know that during our meeting last May, we found a most interesting and informative session with General Lebed. We talked at that time about the consequences of handling weapons of mass destruction, and that will be another issue, I'm sure some of the members will want to pursue today. And you've already mentioned the issue about nuclear warheads, and the proliferation of nuclear materials, and nuclear expertise.
But I will also have some questions looking to, not only the military security of your country, but also, your economic security. The success you're having in moving your nation toward a market-based economy, what's happening to make your country develop a more capable judicial system, to make sure that a market economy is going to be able to function in your country, and also, that you will be moving towards a law enforcement system that is going to be fair and effective to make sure that the underpinnings of order that are necessary for a market economy to function are going to be present.
So, we welcome you here today. We look forward to your testimony, and I thank you for this opportunity to have a chance to offer you some questions. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
REP. WELDON: Thank you, Mr. Pickett. I would remind our colleagues today, that we are doing simultaneous translation for General Lebed. So, please, when you speak, and this is especially important to myself, we must slow down our statements so that the translator can effectively do his job. I would like to now turn to distinguished chairman of our full committee, the Honorable Floyd Spence.
REP. FLOYD D. SPENCE (R-SC): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don't have any comment, except just to welcome our distinguished guests to our meeting today. Thank you.
REP. WELDON: Thank you, Mr. chairman, for being here. This truly is a historic day for this subcommittee and this committee. In the twelve years I've been in Congress, I've only seen one general from Russia, or the former Soviet Union, appear before this committee, and that was when Chairman Ashton had General Affromaho (ph) here. Today is the first time we've had a Russian general appear before our committee, and it is truly an historic day for us.
Let me thank the American Foreign Policy Counsel, in particular, Herman Furtchner (sp), who is here with us today for his cooperation in this effort. Where are you Herman? I want to acknowledge you. Thank you very much for your cooperation. And with that, to our distinguished general, I remind our colleagues that you can listen to the General's testimony on channel 3, turn on your device and turn it to channel 3.
His statement you have I believe before you. It has been translated into English, so, the press has a copy of it, and I would say now to the General.
(Speaks in Russian)
The floor is yours.
GEN. LEBED: (All of General Lebed's remarks are made through and interpreter.) The old thinking is still strong. Then, the mental inertia is still strong, and many in the West still view Russia as an adversary. On the other hand, some people say that Russia lost the Cold War, and therefore, should be treated as a defeated nation. Now, this is a mistake, and according to Mika Villea (ph), a mistake is worse than a crime.
Now, the Cold War was lost by the totalitarian Soviet system, while Russia only benefited from the collapse of the Russian regime. And from the managing opportunity to join civilized democratic nations. This is a victory for the forces of democracy -- our common victory.
Therefore, I think Russia should not be treated as a defeated nation, but rather like a captive released -- (audio break) -- But Russia is not perceiving serious militant threats to herself, and does not intend to threaten anyone. We have neither muscle or will to do so. Having lost to the 20th century, 75 million human lives, we have exhausted our quotas of -- in our revolutions of peoples, and other stupid things. Overall, there are fewer and fewer problems left in the world that could be resolved with brut force.
I'd like to hope that the hero great wars is over. Now, Vietnam, for the USA, Afghanistan, and Chechnya for Russia show that even smaller wars against smaller nations do not guarantee victory to the seemingly stronger side. Now, all out wars have not been won by anyone. Now, we've been vaccinated against imperial ambitions.
The principle threats to Russia's security come from within. They include political instability, economic crisis, corruption and crime, separatists leaning in the promises. In such conditions, there were some hardly count that Russia has a reliable partner. On the contrary, there is a strong temptation to further weaken Russia, and trigger the disintegration of the Federation, fencing off the remnants with a quarantine zone. Such ideas have some currency in the United States among other places.
However, a weaker Russia is unlikely to strengthen America. Such policy, if misused, would only re-ignite mistrust and tension between our nations, playing in the hands of those opposing democratic evolution of Russia. Success of such policy, is fraught with dozens of new military conflicts throughout the former Soviet Union, problems of Yugoslavia and Iraq would then pale by comparison.
Needless to say, everyone will be a loser. I do not think that the United States of America would like to deal with a Russia shaken by domestic conflict -- embittered and cornered Russia. Therefore, though I run for governor of Russia's largest providence, the Grant (ph), and though I criticize the inadequate regional policy of the federal center, nevertheless, I still firmly support Russia's unity. And I will do my best to prevent its collapse and disintegration into European Siberia and the Far East Republics.
I'd like to repeat once again, Russia is the center of Eurasia, and Krasnoyarsk is the central Russia, and it is there where a new house center should be created from where genuinely democratic reconstruction of Russia would start. Now, what has Russia reconstructed? My friends and mine have explained in this book, and it is called, Russia Reconstructed.
Unfortunately, I haven't had time to have it adequately translated into English, but I can guarantee you that within a month, the book will be professionally translated, and made available in the United States -- well, made available to the Congress, generals, and your committee, Mr. Chairman, in particular.
Now, serious threats to Russia's security, as we see it, includes aggravation of global problems, thus, concern the entire world community. They may include the problems of proliferation and use of weapons of mass destruction, escalation of regional conflicts, international terrorism, political and religious extremism, climate changes, deterioration of the environment. Now, to control such traps, Russia is ready for broad international cooperation, and I think Russia will be able to make a substantial contribution to the ultimate success of such efforts.
Now, whom Russia regards allies and opponents. It depends on the political 0vesture of Russia. I count myself and my supporters among those forces that stand for a strong democratic Russia, relying on market economies, and respecting the rules of international law. I hope that soon, such forces may claim their decisive victory in Russia. The natural allies of such a new Russia would include the nations with full-fledged democracies, and above all, the countries of European culture, among whom, Russia belongs. Moving west, the moves far-sided policy would be consistent assistance to Russia with the implementation of this development scenario.
Now as regard to Poland, while we are not recruiting any a priori, now the Russians have a wise saying which translates into English as, don't measure others with your own yardstick. The literal translations of that, don't impose your set of rules on others. This is not for us to determine whether the political arena in this or that country is good or bad, it is the internal affairs of that nation and its people.
Now, we are prepared for mutually beneficial cooperation of America and Europe, Asia and the Islamic world. The only possible obstacle in the way of such cooperation may arise if any country violates the accepted rules of international law, existing treaties, and human rights. This is a universal principle of all democratic nations, and Russia will be no exception there.
Now, stronger global security is the foundation of national security. Now, speaking about the security, I'd like to say that despite all its current problems, Russia is not just able to mind its own business with its new foreign aid, it can provide actual assistance in solving various international problems.
(Off mike.)
Now, as a serviceman, whose been through a whole number of armed conflicts, I take the problem of preventing and ending wars very close to heart. Our shrinking global village known as Earth is too fragile and vulnerable to afford the relatively petty skirmishes. And no nation can unilaterally assume the role of an arbitrator in those conflicts. Yet, such a judge is badly needed. Likewise, we need forces to locally enforce international order. The UN peacekeeping forces as they are today are not effective enough.
Maybe we, the USA and then Russia and Western Europe, should think of setting up some new quality of multinational combined unit, well trained and armed international police, including representatives of various countries and acting within the limits of law, under effective international control. The creation of such mobile armed forces could become an example of mutual trust of the partner nations, and become a bright symbol of a new era in the understanding, and maintenance, of national and international security.
And in conclusion, I'd like to note that I'm neither a political romantic, nor an idealist. I give myself full account, that in the foreseeable future the foreign policy of every nation, much like before, would be based on its national interests.
The difference from the past, though, boils down to the fact that for a growing number of countries maintenance of international stability and order is claiming higher priority as an item among its national interests, and sooner or later all nations will come to recognize that fact. Russia is recognizing it already. I wish to thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you esteemed members of the Committee.
REP. WELDON: (addresses the witness in Russian.) We will now proceed to questions and General Lebed, I will ask two questions, and then we will move through the entire Committee to give each member a chance to ask their own questions with the goal of finishing the hearing by 4:00pm.
General in the three previous meeting we've spent considerable time discussing the decay of the Russian military and the consequences of that decay for Russia and ultimately the entire world. My sense is that this is one of your gravest concerns. I know it is an issue that I have spent considerable time and energy on as well.
We've discussed a number of topics related to this issue. Including, the poor moral and the wage arrearages for soldiers and sailors, the lack of compassion for what many view as a defeated army, the penetration of the military by organized crime, the impact of drastically reduced funding on the readiness of key military systems, including strategic systems, the physical deterioration of military installations, especially as it relates to security of weapons of all sorts.
All of these concerns, and I know many on the Committee share these concerns, are inextricable related to what I feel is the major issue confronting Russian and American policy makers and that is the security of Russian nuclear material, nuclear weapons, and their means of delivery. I know much has been written and said about the issue of man-portable, tactical nukes the so-called nuclear suitcases. I do not wish to dwell simply on that narrow subject, but rather I want to discuss with you the broader issue of the security of nuclear material and weapons.
So, my question is: America is greatly concerned about this issue, and has backed up our concerns with American resources to help improve the security of the nuclear material and nuclear weapons. How concerned are you about the security of Russian nuclear material and weapons? What can you tell us about the current security? What poses the greatest threat to the security of weapons? Is it organized crime; is it desperation and poverty that drives the soldiers, sailors, or scientists to steal material? Is it lax physical security at the bases or labs? It is poor management and accounting systems that could allow a theft to go undetected for some time? And is the administration today in Moscow, the Yeltsin Administration, doing enough to deal with this situation?
GEN. LEBED: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Currently a candle is coming aflare in this state Duma of Russia with the support of the control chamber. Now the essence of it as follows: The General for Secures Office has been funded by 146 percent, yet the conversion of the military industrial complex has been funded from the budget only by 2.5 percent against the planned volume. And supplies of material and equipment to the armed forces have been funded only by 11 percent against the planned figures.
Now, since this is the budget, it is the government who is responsible for it and personally Mr. Churna Muldron (ph). And it is the general procurator's office who is supposed to monitor compliance with the budget. So, the deputies are asking a legitimate question. Our esteemed prosecutors, now did you get a bribe to turn a blind eye on what has not been funded and financed.
So, behind those figures is the entire essence of the current politics of the Russian politically towards the Russian armed forces. Now everything has been done so that excellently prepared, trained professionals, when leaving the armed forces when leaving the armed forces would join the criminal ranks for them to trade arms and ammunition. So, that nukes would be lost, or some biological, chemical weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction.
Now, delays in salary can be up to six months. Our commissioned officers are trying to earn a living anywhere but outside the military service. They serve as guards, they work as porters. In other words, the did their worst for the army, for the officers court to consistently feel humiliated, degraded. I'd like to remind you that one of the reasons for the 1917 revolution became the degradation of a huge Russian army.
Now, today will raise a second question. Now, as a consequence of my, of what I said about portable nuclear devices -- so the consequence was that I was summoned to the general procurator's office. Well, and I was charged with the, general charge of leaking state secrets. So I ask him the question, now do we, does Russia have portable nuclear devices? The firm answer was no. Well, in that case I asked, why am I here? What secret have I leaked? Well everybody there felt very awkward.
(Laughter.) But frankly speaking, I'm not so much concerned with those nuclear devices themselves. For purely technical reasons, they are losing their capacity very fast. Since '96, I have been trying to resolve another issue. In enclosed cities, where unique technologies were, know-hows were created, including nuclear know-hows, now have a very miserable existence. They are not financed everywhere. And unique experts and they are seeking their fortune around the globe and there are no guarantees against the possibility that say a rich dictator would buy somewhere say in Africa three square miles of land and disguised as a farm, there will be a laboratory built, who will gather together those, often unique experts, would pay them handsomely and gratefully they would do what they can do.
And the world will face the problem of terrorism and nuclear blackmail. Well, then there would be a sure nuclear explosion of one device that would level to the ground a large village somewhere. And then they can call Moscow, New York, Tokyo and demand any money. You know there is a common principle, a general principle. That nuclear charges can be dismantled by those who assembled them. Well these should be precisely the people who services those charges. They should organize storage of the nuclear waste from those devices. These people must be gathered. Jobs must be given to these people. These people should be paid for loyalty. Only then can we sleep calmly.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
REP. WELDON: Thank you, General. I have one additional question and then I'll turn to my colleague. General, as you know, and I discussed this with you last evening, there's been increasing public attention in the United States and around the world regarding the January 1995 incident in which a Norweigan scientific research rocket launched from an island in the Bering Sea, was detected by the Russian early warning system and mistakenly determined to be a US submarine launched missile.
This set in motion the entire Russian nuclear command structure which went on nuclear alert. And nuclear alert in this instance meant the notification of President Yeltsin and the activation of the chaggauts (ph) -- the briefcase size devises used for authorizing the launch of Russia's significant nuclear arsenal. I should note that up to this point, these devices had never been activated for an emergency. In the language of arms controllers, President Yeltsin was one decision point away, or in plain English, less than several minutes away from launching an all out nuclear attack on the United States.
According to many experts this was the closest the US and Russia have ever come to nuclear Armaggedon. Far closer than during past incidences of increased international tension, like the Cuban Missile Crisis. The idea that we came so perilously close to nuclear war as a result of a miscalculation, rather than any sort of provacative action, should be cause for considerable concern both in Russia and the US.
In your view, how likely is it that we could see a repeat of this sort of miscalculation or even possibly, heaven forbid, an accidental launch? Simply put, how concerned should we be about this sort of thing? And second, what can you tell us about the changes, if any, that were made by the Ministry of Defense and President Yeltsin in response to this incident?
I know that from our previous meetings, you are concerned about the decline of the Russian military, both in terms of welfare and morale of the troops and the readiness of key systems like early warning radars. Do you think either of these problems could contribute to another incident of this type?
Thank you.
GEN. LEBED: Thank God, Mr. Chairman, you are not quite right. Each system can respect itself, should have one feature and that is to be fool resistant. So, a missile can be launched only by a coordinated effort of the supreme commander -- this is the president -- the minister of defense and head of the generals. But bearing in mind some statements made by the supreme commander in the past few months are for example to reduce the armed forces by 3 million men, whereas now we have only 1.7 serving in the forces.
And listing Germany and Japan among the great nuclear nations, and a number of others, while we indicate a certain inadequacy of the supreme commander. Of course it is quite dangerous when one component of the system, ie the nuclear button, is with a person like that. And being a commander in chief, he can easily make the other two elements agree.
And this nuclear suitcase that is carried -- for the president which is with him all the time -- it has another function. Now it is the symbol of power. Whereas in the past, Russian monarchs would be depicted with the crown, with the sceptre, and the orb, now this device replaces that all.
Thank you.
REP. WELDON: Thank you, General. Mr. Pickett.
REP. PICKETT: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Now General Lebed, I'm going in a slightly different direction. And talk a little bit about your country's economy.
You mentioned in your remarks, the effort to move towards a market economy, but there are reports that large amounts of capital are leaving your country and going to places like Cyprus and other spots in the world where wealthy people tend to congregate. This indicates a lack of confidence in your economic system by the wealthy people that are profiting mostly -- most -- from your system.
Could you tell our committee where you think your country is in this process of getting to a market economy? Do you think where you are now is irreversible an that the committment is firm? And how do you think it will take for this conversion to reach a point where you can say that you do indeed have a market economy?
GEN. LEBED: Thank you. Perhaps, I wasn't quite clear in my words. But I never mentioned that we have developed, that we do have, well-developed market economic relationships. I said, I only said that I am an opponent, that I am a supporter of market economy.
Mr. Gilman kindly informed today of the scope and volume of American aid, including financial aid, to Russia. And I was sitting and sadly thinking that first the American humanitarian aid was stolen, now the same is happening to the American money, equally were the French money, or German money, and the like.
For in this respect, nothing has changed in Russia. It is the old party bureaucratic system or nomenclature, which is still in power in our country. Which hastily repainted itself into democratic colors. But they are doing only what they can do. They can't behave any different.
The democratic super structure is attracting foreign investment, and the money is stolen, and then it goes back to the West, but not as the property of the, now Western countries, but rather as the money belonging to those criminals, semi-criminal, groups.
Now, privatization was conducted in the interest of at most 5 percent of the population. The middle class, at best, amounts to 8 percent of the population. The tax policy pursued in Russia, puts a fat cross on all the attempts of people to create a small or medium sized business. Criminals are ubiquitous and the bureaucratics are -- there is bureaucratic arbitrariness raging in the country. All US business men I've met in the past week, without exception, have noted the fact. There is capital flight from Russia. All population is engaged in tax evasion because tax is insane. The investments are not protected, and there are no guarantees for the investments. Legislation is becoming less and less serialized (ph). Well, all the miracles, I know of, like the Japanese miracle, Korean miracle -- took, say five years. At least within five years, it became clear to those nations that they are on the right track. Now, we've been in this transformation process for seven years now. And the only result is that 85 percent of the population is around the poverty line. Huge amounts of foreign money was stolen and pocketed. As a result, I say we're further from the market reforms and democratic transformations than we were in 1991.
So, I'd like, simply, to ask you once again to stop financing people, simply who are not decent and who steal your money. If you stop financing them, you'll help Russia become a civilized nation. And then there'll be no alternative to the market. Then Russia will tear off the mask that it is sick and tired of. A mask of a country, which is making believe that it has democracy. A nation pretending that it has market relations and trying to show to the world, and would at long last commence the real democratic market reforms.
Thank you.
REP. PICKETT: Thank you very much, and thank you, Mr. Chairman.
REP. WELDON: Thank you, Mr. Pickett. Mr. Bartlett.
REP. ROSCOE BARTLETT (R-MD): Thank you very much, and welcome to our committee. Our government is encouraging NATO expansion into the Eastern European Block countries. My question is what do you understand is the reason that our government would be promoting that? Who would benefit if NATO were expanded into the Eastern European Block countries, and would it make the world more secure?
GEN. LEBED: Thank you. As I have said, I received no serious military threats to Russia from the western civilization. I have also depicted the disposition of the players on the board, i.e., a prosperous, consolidated western world led by the United States. On the other hand, Russia suffering a systemic crisis. And it will take Russia a long time to become a real competitor for the west, if that can happen at all, even if it starts doing everything correctly tomorrow on. And again, because of its very poor economic conditions, Russia cannot even think about any form of aggression.
Now I believe it is unethical to deliberate or speculate on the motives of your political leadership. I can only express my point of view. Now this NATO expansion process is underway. Russia is in no position to exert any form of influence on the process at all. I'd say that sit on the side of the road of that process and to complain and to cry out is humiliating business. So I'm not going to do that.

That's why I'd like to put it this way. If the NATO member countries and the United States have spare cash to burn. If the smart western politicians and military strategists believe that their military might would grow tremendously by including in NATO the Czech Republic. And if the western taxpayers, who I think can count money very well, if they don't object, go ahead, expand. And of their each have their follies. No problem.
Thank you very much.
REP. WELDON: Thank you, Mr. Bartlett. Mr. Abercrombie from Hawaii.
REP. NEIL ABERCROMBIE (D-HI): Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, with your permission I would like to wish our guests a big aloha. That's a Hawaiian word that means you're welcome here. Mr. Chairman, this is a unique day, and again with your permission I would like to present General Lebed with a gift from Hawaii. I would like to say to you, General, that I consider this one of the best experiences I've had in the Congress, and I'm very grateful to you and to Chairman Weldon for it. I think that this is going to prove to be a major step in the relationship between Russia and the United States. To be able to speak with you in person is not just an honor, but I think we'll find as a result of the hearing today, members of Congress having a new and deeper understanding of the necessity of the relationship between Russia and the United States.
With that, Mr. Chairman, I would like to say in Hawaiian to General Lebed -- (Speaking in Hawaiian) -- If you have salt, you have a meal. I would like to present you with a gift of salt from all of the islands in the Hawaiian chain as a measure of the hospitality that we would like to extend to you one day, and that we know that the Russian people are famous for. And I would like to present you, as well, because I know this is a long day and you need energy, chocolate covered macadamia nuts from the Hawaiian Islands. (Laughter)
(Off mike)
REP. WELDON: Now we're going to ask Mr. Abercrombie to do the hula for you. (Laughter)
REP. ABERCROMBIE: I'm sure you'll agree, General, that it is the human equation that is the most important one, and in Hawaii we extend our hospitality to people all over the world, and we most certainly extend it to you as members of this subcommittee.
I'm very interested in your remarks with respect to the formation of an armed international police force, well trained and involving mixed units. I just got back from Bosnia on a congressional delegation under the defense appropriations chair, Mr. Young of Florida, a bipartisan republican and democrat delegation. While there, we saw in operation, the development of a police force that would command the respect of the various communities, Serbian, Croatian, Christian, Muslim. In the area of the zone of separation between the federated states and the Republic of Sihirskoye (sp). The object of the creation of the international police task force is to develop a system of justice and a cadre of police officials who will engender in the population a sense of hope and confidence that they will be treated fairly.
While your remarks in your testimony indicate that you are thinking along the lines of an international force which may be able to go into difficult political situations and command respect, I would like to know, in the present circumstances facing the former Yugoslavia, in the area in which Russia obviously has a very profound interest; the conflict with the Serbs, the Croats, and maybe extending into Kosovo now. I would like your opinion as to whether or not the international police task force as envisioned by the Dayton Agreement is a possible fruitful first step in the creation of this kind of force and that it would help to prevent hostilities and difficulties.
GEN. LEBED: Thank you for the kind words. Thank you for a nice present.
Now, your question. Now I have fought a lot in my life. And I've come to the conclusion that the supreme weapon given to us by God is the reason or intelligence. It is a weapon second to none. Actually, it is indeed the supreme weapon. So using it, we can resolve any problem whatsoever. And the force that has taken shape in Bosnia, so the like of it, we'll be capable of resolving almost any task. Now, provided two conditions are met. One, this fist will be with brains. And behind this force, there will be law, or it will be backed by law.
Thank you.
REP. ABERCROMBIE: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
REP. WELDON: Thank you, Mr. Abercrombie. From the great state of Virginia, Chairman of our Readiness Committee, Mr. Bateman.
REP. HERBERT BATEMAN (R-VA): Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and let me add a word of welcome to General Lebed. We're very pleased and privileged to have you before us today, and to have you share your views with us.
Let me, if I may, comment that I fervently, and I think this is a view that most of the people that I represent share; that Russia will be able to resolve the systemic crisis as you describe it. It is certainly completely consistent with the best interest, not only of your country, but I fervently believe also, our country.
I'm concerned as to, well, not concerned, interested in hearing your share your views further on how you think Russia will be able to get through this systemic crisis, and whether or not you see a whisk of a coup of some kind, either from the military or other factions within the Russian society, as you try to resolve this crisis and bring about, hopefully, a democratic free-market oriented society. Thank you.
GEN. LEBED: Thank you. Unfortunately, we all dealing with a vicious circle in our relationships. Quite logically, all the democratic at heart Congressmen and Senators of the United States are telling us Russians, first, set your house in order, and then we shall talk. Your legislation is wild. Your taxes are huge. Your criminals are ubiquitous. You have more bureaucrats than gangsters. You are a very -- a rock which is impossible to understand. No matter from which side you are approached, something is bound to happen to you. You will either be cheated or robbed. Or they'll beat you up, or they will even kill you.
In short, first have your problems resolved and then we shall talk. On the other hand, the volume of problems facing Russia is such that it is almost impossible to resolve them on our own. Or probably we can but then those methods of putting the house in order will be far from democratic. As far as those instances of aid and assistance provided to Russia that Senator Gilmor informed me of today, elements of an unconcerted action. They would all be formed, not in accordance with a single comprehensive plan.
Put it this way, it's like, you know, trying to make a democratic hit with an open fist. Now he who makes a strike with an open fist, we breaks his fingers. However, if we look hard into the history of our relationships since '85 when perestroika was declared. No comparable to a martial plan program was ever offered to Russia. And if the western countries pursue their policy of, you know, closing their nose in disgust. That they don't feel like, you know, helping Russia now because of its internal problems. What they can get is a hugely criminalized territory. Embittered to the possible human limits population. I say that the martial plan was a stroke of genius that helped the United States turn the former enemies into partners, allies, and ultimately, friends. Now, once again, do I turn to this book. And once again, I'd like to repeat. Within a month, this book will be delivered here and we have here all the possible scenarios of development. REP. BATEMAN: I look forward to reading that book.
REP. WELDON: Thank you, Mr. Bateman. From the state of Mississippi, Mr. Taylor.
REP. GENE TAYLOR (D-MS): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. General, welcome. We, members of Congress, welcome you in our attempts to try to put some of the ugly and dangerous legacies of the Cold War between our nation and the former Soviet Union to rest. In my capacity, on the Personnel Committee, I'm often contacted by the widows, the wives, the children of American service people who strongly believe that their husbands, their dads, could be alive and in Russia as a result of the wars in both Korea and Vietnam.
Something that I had hoped would occur as a result of the demise of the Soviet Union but had not yet seen coming from the government of Russia is a full accounting of those American servicemen who it is commonly believed were brought to the Soviet Union; a different time; a different conflict; a conflict that's over; in order to bring some peace to those people's hearts, and let them know the whereabouts if they're alive and fate, if they're not. I would ask you as the former head of the Soviet military if you have any knowledge or anyone you know has any knowledge of Americans who are still in Russia, either of their own free will or against their will.
GEN. LEBED: Thank you for raising this very humane topic. A nation, which has self-respect when, sending its soldiers to war . It is nice to ensure that all their live soldiers would, when the war is over, would get home, and all those fallen they would have an individual grave. And I support this approach, and I've always been guided by these thoughts in my life. And I'm prepared to give my full support to such matter, such sacred matters. I feel ashamed for my country. I feel very ashamed because in the refrigerated trains of the Rustavi (?) Medical Laboratory, Military Medical Laboratory, there are unidentified bodies of 496 people. And just in the city of Grozny alone, there are 58 mass graveyards where from three to 25 corpses are found. I understand the issue you raised has been raised so many times.
Two and a half years ago, we discussed this issue with the then, Ambassador of the United States, Mr. Pickering. He will agree that it is insane to keep a soldier, a private in prison simply because he was sent by his mother country to war. So when the Soviet Union was collapsing, when the doors of the prison were thrown open, and prisoners were released, and if the people you mentioned, were not harmed there, we must acknowledge that probably they're not alive.
But, we are obligated; we must try and find their graves. This matter, I'm at one with you, and I'm prepared to give you my full support.
Thank you. REP. TAYLOR: General, I very much appreciate your comments. But it's not every day that I get the opportunity to speak with the former head of the Russian Military, and it'll probably be a long time before I get another chance. So specifically, my question would be, are you either now or were you ever personally aware of Americans being held captive in the former Soviet Union or now?
REP. WELDON: Before the General answers that question, just let me repeat for the Record that General Lebed was not the head of the entire Russian Military, the Soviet Military, he was the Senior General, who commanded certain divisions in the Russian Military and was never Defense Minister, so we just need to note that for the record.
REP. TAYLOR: Thank you for that clarification, Mr. Chairman.
GEN. LEBED I'm very grateful to the Chairman who came to help me. See, in Afghanistan I was a Battalion Commander in Modolva, I was an Army Commander. Then I was visiting all the hot beds of tension. But who will have responsibility, I can tell you that I've never crossed roads with American soldiers or prisoners. I've never fought them, and I can assume that they never fought me. So we've never dealt with any prisoners of war or wounded American servicemen. And I can assure you that I've never heard from the people who I have dealt with about such instances. Thank you.
REP. TAYLOR: Well, If I may, thank you, General, for his responding to the question, and I think he knows of my request to him. I have clearly heard his request of this committee, and I would do what I can to honor his request, and I would hope that he would honor mine.
REP. WELDON: I thank the gentlemen.
Mr. Saxton, from New Jersey.
REP. H. JAMES SAXTON (R- NJ): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. General, I'd like to, of course, add my words of welcome to you and thanks to you for being here. When I grew up and when you grew up, we had American weapons pointed at your country, and you had Soviet weapons pointed at our country. And it is to say the least, a refreshing and exhilarating experience to be here with you today, and to have heard you say in your opening statement, that our roles together, today are to solve problems together that face both of our nations. Certainly many years ago, when I was a young man, I never thought that we would have this experience together. And so I appreciate this moment very much.
Let me ask you a specific question about an issue that the Chairman discussed in a general sense and that you did as well. General, since the fall of 1997, an intense debate has been taking place here in Washington in official circles. The statement that you made some months ago that several nuclear suitcase bombs disappeared from the Russian arsenal and subsequent Senate testimony of Professor Yabakof (sp), who was a corresponding a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the former aide to President Yeltsin, confirmed the loss.
Since that time, accumulating evidence strongly suggests that at least some X-Soviet nuclear weapons, are in fact, unaccounted for. Several of these weapons, both tactical warheads for SCUD-type ballistic missiles and aerial bombs for tactical fighter bombers are known, or at least strongly believe to have found their way to Iran and North Korea. Both of these regimes, that is Iran and North Korea, may not be the only customers of missing nuclear bombs from your arsenal.
Particularly, in the case of suitcase bombs, which cause us a great deal of concern, as well, because as you have pointed out correctly, they make very effective terrorist devices and weapons. In November of 1997, you asserted, I'm sorry, Professor Yabakof asserted that the PLO has twice said that it has weapons, allegedly illegally purchased from Russia. Actually, to my knowledge, the PLO has never made such a claim, although I certainly defer to others who may have other information.
Since around 1993 and 1994, Russian intelligence and security forces have been investigating persistent reports that, in fact, a Palestinian, whose name I have in front of me, but will not use in this forum because of the wide media coverage, actually purchased such weapons for Palestinian use. According to these reports, in the spring of 1994, this individual purchased two compact neutron bombs that is enhanced radiation or dirty-suitcase bombs.
He first arrived in Russia, apparently in 1977 as a student, worked in the PLO office in Moscow, later traveled to the United States and apparently had a great deal of experience in trying to obtain these weapons. Many believe that there should be no doubt that this individual or others have been trying to procure these suitcase bombs and that there's ample evidence that a lot of money has changed hands in this regard. However, I can find, in my efforts, no independent hard evidence that these weapons were actually acquired by the PLO. Would you comment on this issue for our enlightenment?
GEN. LEBED: Thank you. Well, to the information you've given, I can only say that this person is a Jordanian by nationality and he, until recently, was publishing an issue called L-CULD (sp) and now it is called ADWEL (sp). It is very important to separate in such instances dis-information from true information. And to provide competent answers to such questions, one should have sufficient authority and access to reliable information sources.
I checked this information from the information channels that I have access to, and I received no confirmation. I cannot guarantee that I have checked everything.
But if I have authority and power to do that, I will resolve this problem. Now, we have come to the stage when we can destroy each other without any war. We can destroy ourselves just because of the stockpiles of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. Because of the lack of elementary order in the country for the lack of responsibility of the top bureaucrats in the country so I'm not denying your information, nor can I confirm it.
Thank you.
REP. SAXTON: Thank you very much, General
REP. WELDON: Thank you, Mr. Saxton. We have three more members who are here to ask questions and I would like to go additionally but I understand the time constraint we're under. By the order of arrival when gavel went down, we have Mr. Hilleary from Tennessee and we'll follow that by Mr. Turner from Texas and Mr. Snyder from Arkansas. Mr. Hilleary.
REP. VAN HILLEARY (R-TN): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is a tremendous hearing. I congratulate you and General, thank you so much for being here. It is a tremendous occasion, I think for this committee.
This may be a simplified question, but I've always just wanted to ask someone in your position this question. I have never understand why the Russians or the Soviets have thought the Americans were a huge threat from an offensive or from an aggressive standpoint. I realize we were maybe a threat potentially because we were reasonably powerful but I was always wondering why the Russians felt like we were aggressive in nature, because I don't know of anything that indicates that? From our point of view and part of this hearing is about learning more about each other and I just want to show you from the American point of view, that there is not many aggressive bones in our body over here.
We recently, you know there were some talk about maybe bombing Iraq, and the big argument over here was well we don't ever do that without first being bombed ourselves. And of course it never happened, and of course it would take much more to make an aggressive decision to make some aggression against a powerful country like the Soviet Union or Russia. Anyway, I've always wondered what was from your perspective what it was exactly that made the Russians think that we were going to get them and therefore, it was a big problem.
And also, I was wanting to follow up very quickly. Well finally and I would be interested in knowing what we could do to fix that perception if that perception still exists. But following on with that very quickly, you talked about getting assistance to Russia. You talked about the Marshall Plan being a great idea. But you also talked about assistance that already goes to Russia, goes into Black Market hands, et cetera. What motivation can you give us that would be positive in order to try to -- say what safe guards could you put in place if assistance was sent.
And in our country, our defense department, and we call it a defense department, not a war department and that may not seem like a big deal except for those kind of changes in this country reflect public sentiment or they would not be done. You know, our defense department has been cut back considerably since the Cold War was over to meet our other social needs. And I wonder if maybe if the Russians have done as much cutting back in their military to meet some of their social needs. That's a bunch of questions. Answer any one you want to.
Thank you very much, General.
GEN. LEBED: Thank you. Now I am surprised that you are surprised. Now, how can we otherwise account for this 70 years of brainwashing and propaganda when day-in-day-out newspapers, radio, magazines, television, depict the image of the bitter scowl of imperialism. And this scowl to look more convincing, it is supported with a map. On the map, you can see that the Soviet Union is surrounded by hundreds of American military bases. And in great detail, it's written there what armaments and material is located in each military base. How many (pershings ?) are located on the territory of Western Germany? How many nuclear silos there are? And then this information is supported by hard facts of life. Now Granada has been hit hard by the United States, so has been Panama.
I'm just giving you a few examples. So, that's why I've told you that the old thinking is still very strong. The inertia of the old thinking is very strong. But I'd say it's mutual. I believe it was President Reagan who coined the phrase The Evil Empire. So, I suppose he was also properly ideologically indoctrinated. So we simply got used to you know admiring each other through the rifle sight. And it is our joint psychological mission to get rid of this psychological habit. As far as your second question is concerned, the recommendations will be very simple.
Well, funds, finances, loans should be made available, one should continue with that. But it should be designated financing through very well thought through and transparent schemes. The schemes that must be audit-able (ph) at each stage now stop believing scoundrels, stop you know taking them at their face value. We are very progressive. We are very democratically minded. Please give us something. Sounds funny, but people give them money. So, let us put an end to such strange practices and then this problem will disappear.
Thank you.
REP. HILLEARY: Thank you, General. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
REP. WELDON: I thank the gentleman. Gentleman from Texas, Mr. Turner.
REP. JIM TURNER (D-TX): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. General Lebed, thank you so much for being here with us today. It certainly, I think gives each of us on this committee and perhaps in the entire room a sense of history to see you here.
As a child I can remember going through as an elementary student the nuclear attack drills that we would have in our little community to be prepared for a nuclear attack from the Soviet Union. And so we all come here today grateful that we are able to sit across the table in dialogue. And I think it's certainly a dialogue that needed to take place. And I think you've done a very outstanding job of opening that dialogue up for us.
As members of Congress who stand for election every two years, I can certainly tell you that each of us can appreciate why you are so personally popular in Russia. Your candor and your demeanor today have certainly been impressive to all of us. And we appreciate your willingness to be here.
One of our former presidents from Texas where I'm from, President Johnson used to cite one of his favorite scriptures from the Bible, come let us reason together. And I was impressed with your comment that you felt one of the supreme gifts from God is our ability to reason. And perhaps some of the problems you've raised today are a reflection of our lack of willingness to sit down and reason with our friends in Russia.
I know that you laid out for us your belief that we should have a Marshall Plan for Russia. And I know each of us on this committee understand that it's in our national interest in the United States to be sure we have a strong and prosperous Russia. Our history over a brief span of 200 years has been a good one because we have always been able to assure our children and our grandchildren that their economic status would be better than it was for us. And you too must be able to assure your people of that to have the stability that you want for your people.
I suppose that we didn't have a Marshall Plan for maybe several reasons for Russia. First of all, I think we had such confidence in the free enterprise system that we thought once Russia moved to a democracy and to capitalism they would happen automatically. Our faith in that system is so great maybe we didn't realize the difficulty you would face. And perhaps we didn't perceive as you do that we still believe Russia to be a powerful nation. Often times I hear comments made by people from Russia that they think that the United States looks upon Russia now as a second class nation. I don't think that's the perception. I think we still hold to the old views of the power of the Soviet Empire and that Russia continues to be a nation of some strength.
We read about the difficulties of your military but still I don't think those stories have sunk through to us that you are struggling to try to put capitalism and democracy in place. And of course, here in the United States we struggle with our own budget. We've finally come to the point where we want to balance our budget, not spend more money every year than we take in and we don't have a lot of extra funds I think to be as generous in programs as you would suggest in the marshal plan for Russia.
But I do think that you need to help us here today and you've touched upon it a couple of times because I think we are left somewhat perplexed as to what to do from here because you have told us that the investments and aid that we've been given to Russia that it falls into the wrong hands. And that if we're going to be true partners in helping build a strong and prosperous system of capitalism and democracy for Russia that we've got to be sure the money that we give gets into the right hands. And I think the same would probably apply to the investments from the private sector.
In the United States today, we have many people who are enjoying a prosperous economy. We have money to invest. Our stock market's reaching new heights. I'm sure American businessmen would look and do look with favor about investment opportunities. And yet, I would suppose you would tell me today that even those investments may be falling into the wrong hands and so I think it would be easy for us to say you need to help us because we want to be a partner but how do you tell the good guys from the bad guys in terms of how we are to proceed from here. We want the dollars that we send to help to be used wisely and we want American investors who desire to be a part of what we hope to be a growing economy in Russia. We want them to have confidence that their investments will turn a responsible profit. So is there any additional advice that you could give us here that might lead us on to the right path?
GEN. LEBED: Thank you. I don't remember the name but there was smart American who used to say that it's not sufficient to (love ?) firm you've also got to work. So that's why I always say that it is not sufficient just to announce or declare a democracy. Democracy is to be built. You have to work to build democracy.
And it is a colossal undertaking and it took a truly democratic nation about 20 years or so to build true democracy. As we went to bed on the 21st of August '91 under a totalitarian regime and we got up in the morning of the next day and we were told that now we live under democracy. Not just democracy but actually the most democratic democracy and in certain places much better than American. So the order was to rejoice from nine till six with a lunch break.
So running for a governor in the province of Kroznyiask (ph), I'd like to set a model. I want to make a system that would be predictable and one one would be able to understand so that there would be a system of guarantees and privileges to invest us both domestic and international. I want to assure legislative support for small and medium size business. I need to create a model to create a -- this is what I mean by saying a new power center.
So this should be the power center from which we in civilized Russia would develop. That would follow civilized rules. That will learn to respect each other. And having attained self-respect would stop, you know, all the cheats and crooks. Now that's why I'm leaving Moscow. I'm convinced nothing much can be done in Moscow now. Moscow is the very advertisement of our, you know, democratic reforms, a showcase.
He who wants to see how things are, in natural fact, to see the real Russia, they should, well, go 150 kilometers away from Moscow. Mothers and teachers taught us that we should be honest, reliable and responsible and on the one hand it seems so easy to be honest, and on the other hand it is so difficult. So I'd like to create a system where honesty will be the best policy; where it'll be profitable to be honest. But no one in Russia now believes anyone's word, so only one way left for me; I've got to put my words into life. Thank you.
REP. TURNER: Thank you, General Lebed. We wish you well, and Godspeed.
REP. WELDON: I thank the gentleman from Texas.
The gentleman from Arkansas, Mr. Snyder.
REP. VIC SNYDER (D-AR): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for arranging this hearing. General, in your statement in your list of what you called serious threats to Russian security, you put at the top of the list the problem of proliferation and the use of weapons of mass destruction. From your perspective as a military leader what nations do you see that put Russia at risk if these weapons of mass destruction were to proliferate to?
GEN. LEBED: Well, theoretically any, no matter how large it is. It is important what weapons it has and how it is to deliver a strike. I mentioned that I'm not going to point any enemies. Now naming some country I may indirectly, you know, turn into enemies, you know, some countries into enemies. So with your question you are directly forcing me to do it. Not too good.
REP. SNYDER: I understand. We had a former Secretary of Defense here that says if you call someone an enemy often enough they eventually become their enemy. And I understand what you're saying. Second question, given the problems that you have articulated, that the Russian economy's having, how much economic pressure do you think there is to export military technology that Russia would otherwise prefer not to export, except for the economic pressure? If I might, perhaps, clarify. Arms sales have always been a good cash crop for certain countries, and is Russia now in a position of having to sell arms and technology that it otherwise would not be selling, except for the status of the economy?
GEN.LEBED: Soviet Union had a very powerful military industrial complex. You know the military industrial complex in the Soviet Union, for dozens of years, accumulated the best minds and enormous money was invested in it. And we were successfully competing with the American military industrial complex by trading arms around the globe; a whole range of weapons. Then for unknown reasons, the huge military industrial complex was put to a halt. I can assure you, once again, that no serious work was done to carry out a well thought through scientific conversion plan.
What was offered was to stop producing (pans?) or survive where you can. Well, our people, let me say, have nine lives as cats, so we started surviving. And military transport planes fell in dirt on the airports. And inside there were two fighters. The value of those fighters was $54 million. Well, no one quite can make out how they got there. The most sophisticated weapons systems are being sold to China, I mean the whole nomenclature.
What does China pay back with? With underpants, socks, handkerchiefs, so-called barter deals. So I wouldn't give them, say, we have a State policy, government policy. It's rather the signs that there is now comprehensive policy. The sign that the arms trade was given into the hands of just traders; the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. And there is no state structure about those traders to determine the national strategy, national security policy. Now anything that is bought is being traded. Well, I'm not aware of any purchases of nuclear warheads and nuclear charges. The rest I heard was on sale. So it is senseless to give the list of an assortment of weapons systems sold. Everything's on sale. With licenses and without, directly and through third countries. You know, when you are hungry anything, and some people can't produce anything but pain. What should they do? Thank you.
REP. SNYDER: Thank you, General, for being here today. And hope you enjoy the rest of your trip to the United States.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
REP. WELDON: I thank the gentleman. I thank the General for being here. General, I told you we'd try to keep you to approximately four. But we have one quick question from Congressman Bartlett and I will wrap it up and we'll end this session.
Congressman Bartlett real quickly.
REP. ROSCOE G. BARTLETT (R-MD): Thank you very much. I'm sure that each of our countries does things that mystifies the other. I would like to mention a few things that are reported in our papers about what is going on in Russia and ask if you can help us understand. It is reported that you continue to expand your deep underground bunkers around Moscow all connected by very deep rail systems, all very nuclear secure. You continue to launch submarines, which are as good, or better, than ours. You frequently sail to our coasts, undetected; your submarines are really quite good. You continue, we are told, to build biological weapons. And you continue to spend, perhaps, as much as $4 billion on (Yamato?) Mountain, which is the world's largest, most nuclear secure facility. You do this while, as you admit, you have very large internal needs, infrastructure needs. You cannot pay your soldiers, you cannot meet your obligations on the space station and yet you continue to make these expenditures. Can you help us understand?
GEN. LEBED: Thank you. I find myself somewhat confused. I'd like to ask you whose lives are supposed to be saved by those underground facilities? Of Bill Clinton's big friend, Boris Yeltsin and his family of seven? Vice-president's big friend Viktor Chernomyrdin's family with whom he has been clapping hands in the joint commission for five years. Now, I wasn't invited there. Well, what prevented you from asking Mr. Chernomydrin. I understand he recently visited Washington. Well, I know about the underground facilities built under Stalin. My headache in '96 was to find money to mothball that construction. So that it wouldn't be flooded or destroyed by the ground ships.
Now, I dealt with the problem but the problem was to mothball those facilities. And that was a big headache. I have tackled quite a few problems. Even now, in the naval bases, we have 132 nuclear submarines with not dismantled nuclear reactors.

Mind you, these commissioned nuclear submarines and it is not clear where to get huge amounts of money to disassemble and to dismantle those nuclear reactors I don't know, may as well be that those, that that information, just another myth about Soviet Military threat. I think, I think that what's being done is very strongly the American taxpayers are being ideologically brainwashed . You see how treacherous those Russians are. So you really must pay for NATO's expansion.
(Laughter.)
REP. WELDON: Thank you Mr. Bartlett. Let me just say General before I close, I have over the past year on at least nine separate occasions ask the current Administration of Russian to provide transparency on Yablonovoi Mountain, so that we can understand. I've offered to go there and visit. I wrote a three-page letter to President Yeltsin in July, which I have yet gotten a response to. I have raised the issue with Minister Mikhaylov, Minister Orlov, with Deputy Minister Mikoshian (ph), and it's exactly for the reason you mentioned because it is raised so much to me in my efforts to work with Russia that I don't have an answer.
And the way to get beyond this is to be honest and just talk about what it is, if it's a public works project get beyond it and focus on ways that we can cooperate together. But we have tried and we've gotten several different answers on what the purposes in 1991, the general in charge of projects Sverdlosnov (ph) said it was an ore mining facility. In '92, he said it was a site for storing food and clothing and in '93, '94 the intelligence community in Russia said that Russia was entitled to state secrets, which they are.
But the point is that our intelligence has no idea what the complex is and it is a growing concern among members of Congress as to why this huge project involving two clone cities Baleret 15 (ph) and Baleret 16 (ph) would continue with economic problems that Russia has today. But that's an that we have to continue to work.
Let me just say in closing that your testimony has been candid, forthright. You've been very open. And we appreciate that. We ask you here and invited you here to learn, to learn your perspectives on the state of Russia, especially from the National Security standpoint. And we understand that on many occasions you've disagreed with the current Administration in Russia, an administration that I have a great deal of respect for and that I will continue to work with. We also respect the democracy in Russia, and your right to run for public office, and to seek the support of the voters in Russia as you're doing.
Let me also add that you've provided some very interesting ideas for us, the need for a Marshall Plan. In fact before the hearing, since you outlined this to us last evening, one of our former national security advisors who has sat through this entire hearing, Sven Cramer (sp) suggested perhaps you ought to rename that and we ought to call it the Lebed Plan. A plan to work with Russia and with you to look for ways we can more aggressively help Russia stabilize itself.
Over the past year, I've traveled to your country four times, my fourteen visits to your nation. And am working with colleagues to try to provide a housing mortgage financing system for the average Russian family, bypassing your banks that take too much interest from the people. And that won't loan money for long periods of time. Our whole purpose in establishing a mortgage-financing program is to help Russia create the middle class. As you said at the beginning only eight percent of Russia's population is a middle class.
What has stabilized America since the Great Depression has been the middle class and the development of that middle class has largely been stabilized by an aggressive housing construction industry. And we're committed to continue to work on those kinds of initiatives while talking about defense and security concerns.
In fact, in the third week of April we will host, I will co-host with Sherri Goodman from the Department of Defense 20 senior Russian leaders from the State DUMA and we will have discussions about defense and environmental co-operations. On one day we will discuss the housing initiative, which I had discussed with Speaker Seleznev (ph) and the factional leaders of the various factions in the State DUMA, even Zhirnovsky. And on another day we will discuss the formation of a nuclear waste commission to deal with the nuclear waste problem that you've outlined that both Russia and the US have, especially that of decommissioned nuclear submarines.
So I say to you at the conclusion of your visit you've sparked some new ideas. You've sparked some new feeling and I think you've created a new effort at working more aggressively with you, particularly you as a leader. We look forward to continuing that dialogue. And hopefully when you return to America, it'll be as an elected official, so that we can continue to work on the Lebed Plan and other ideas that you've promised to us.
So I thank you for being here. And I thank the American Foreign Policy Council for its support for this effort and all the staff of the National Security Committee who have worked so tirelessly along with my staff to make sure that this hearing has come off without a glitch. Thank you. The hearing stands adjourned
