WASHINGTON (AP)--Contingency plans are imperative for federal agencies struggling to meet a Jan. 1, 2000, deadline for fixing a potentially disruptive computer glitch, a government investigator says.
Some probably won't be ready in time and agencies currently on schedule could be thrown off track by last-minute foulups, said Gene L. Dodaro, assistant comptroller general for the General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm.
That could mean trouble for anyone who receives government checks, pays taxes, flies in an airplane, receives student loans or manages the military, he said.
'Financial transactions could be delayed, airline flights grounded and national defense affected,' he told a joint meeting of two House technology subcommittees Wednesday.
Government computer systems that perform calculations involving dates may begin generating incorrect data after Dec. 31, 1999, because for several decades computer systems have used two digits to represent a year to save electronic storage space and reduce computing costs.
This means that after 1999, 2000 will be shown as 00, indistinguishable from 1900.
As of Feb. 15, about 35% of the roughly 7,850 computer systems labeled as 'mission critical' were ready for 2000, according to the White House Office of Management and Budget.
Forty-five percent are being fixed, 14.6% are being replaced and 4.6% are being retired.
Costs already have jumped. In February 1997, the OMB estimated fixing the problem would cost $2.3 billion. Its most recent estimate was $4.7 billion.
To help the government head off trouble, President Clinton appointed a council last month to oversee a government-wide effort to reprogram or replace computers systems.
