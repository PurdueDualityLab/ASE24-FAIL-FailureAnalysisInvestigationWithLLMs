Beginning today, electric companies must compete

Lights will flip on. Toasters will pop up. And the laws of electromagnetics remain in place. But California's electricity users awaken today to a new era.
The long-awaited deregulation of the state's $23 billion electricity market begins this morning with the opening of the Power Exchange, the new Alhambra-based electronic auction house where power will be bought and sold like other commodities.
By Wednesday, companies such as San Diego Gas & Electric Co. will turn over control of their power grids to the Independent System Operator in Folsom, and scores of new companies will begin supplying power to the customers they have lured away from SDG&E and other utilities.
Though the closely watched move to competition has been marred by delay, controversy and consumer apathy, supporters of deregulation say the state's power market will be revolutioned by the change.
''This is an historic moment for the state of California,'' said Gregory Conlon, the California Public Utilities Commission member who signed the orders launching retail power competition.
''This will end a 100-year-old monopoly in California.''
State officials promise competition will bring prices down while maintaining the reliability consumers have come to expect from regulated local utilities. They're confident that the ISO established at a cost of $150 million will keep power flowing.
Supporters also say ratepayers will now have unprecedented freedom to choose their power companies, with the ability to boost the production of ''green'' or more cleanly produced electricity.
But as state officials throw the switch on a deregulated market, there is skepticism and criticism.
Many of the same officials insisted the system would be ready to go three months ago, when software glitches caused a delay.
Embarrassed by scams that have already cheated thousands, the PUC has also promised to toughen its policing of new suppliers, at least a few of whom quickly proved fraudulent.
The deregulation of California's power market, the biggest in the nation and the first to embrace competition, could determine how the nation's $230 billion electricity business opens up.
''Everybody is looking to California as a leader,'' said Benjamin Hobbs, a professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore who studies energy systems.
''If this falls on its face in California, it will stop or slow down restructuring elsewhere.''
So far, few Californians have taken advantage of the new competitive market, despite aggressive marketing efforts from would-be providers and state officials.
The state's three major utilities say that only 36,000 customers have switched to new power companies. San Diego has been particularly difficult for new power suppliers to penetrate, with just 4,060 of SDG&E's 1.2 million customers asking to switch.
State Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, a principal author of the legislation behind deregulation, said consumers who stay put may be choosing wisely. Thanks to the deregulation law, even customers who stay with their local utilities will receive a mandated 10 percent rate cut.
''For 95 percent of electricity customers, the smart choice will be to sit and watch,'' said Peace. He suspects few new power suppliers will be able to beat the 10 percent mandated reduction in the early going.
Peace believes the benefits of true competition won't be enjoyed by California consumers until 2001.
Even now, only the business of generating power is subject to deregulation. If ratepayers switch to a new company, they will still pay about 75 percent of their total monthly bill to local utilities for use of local power lines, which continue as local monopolies.
All ratepayers will also pay a controversial ''competition transition charge'' $28 billion in payments to utilities for plants they say will become unprofitable under deregulation. The plants have been dubbed ''stranded assets.''
Prominent among the stranded assets are the costs of nuclear power plants, whose construction was opposed by many to begin with. The cost of all stranded assets is passed along to consumers in their regular utility bills, amounting to 20 to 25 percent of the monthly total.
Harvey Rosenfield of Citizens Against Utility Taxes or CUT, which is supported by Consumers Union and is leading a petition drive to stop deregulation, says paying for the nuclear plants and other facilities is a hidden $2,000 tax on every power user in the state.
What's more, says Rosenfield, the 10 percent rate cut will provide a bogus savings that ratepayers will more than pay for in coming years. And, he says, deregulation's 10 percent cut came after freezing rates at artificially high levels.
''Deregulation is allowing utilities to stick their hands so deep into our pockets it will take 10 years to get them out,'' he said.
But critics have done little to diminish national interest in California's deregulation plan. Many believe the opening of the state's power market will accelerate the push to deregulate electricity in other states, leading within a few years to a nationally deregulated power industry.
''The revolution is about to begin,'' said Michael Peevey, former head of Southern California Edison and now chief executive officer of New Energy Ventures, one of the more aggressive new power marketers.
Los Angeles-based New Energy Ventures estimates that 10 percent of the state's commercial customers have already selected new power companies. It says it has signed up customers whose power consumption equals that of the city of San Francisco.
Peace and other advocates of deregulation emphasize that California has embarked on a transition to an open electricity market, which won't be reached until all stranded costs are paid for.
It could be a rocky road.
Enron Capital & Trade Resources, a unit of Enron Corp. of Houston, a major natural gas supplier, is already leading a chorus of complaints that the Power Exchange established at a cost of $50 million has created a unwieldy market.
''This system will have to be overhauled in short order,'' said Timothy Belden, who heads California power trading for Enron Capital. ''There is strong lack of knowledge of what trading is about from the ISO to the (Power Exchange).''
There may be alternatives. The Automated Power Exchange in Los Altos, a private venture, promises easier and cheaper trading for big buyers and sellers of power.
Meantime, companies like Green Mountain Energy Resources, a Vermont-based marketer of power from renewable or cleaner sources, report that at least some consumers are looking for something other than the cheapest source of power.
Green Mountain says only 25 percent of its customers are taking its cheapest power offering. About 75 percent, said the company, are opting for power whose generation has less environmental impact but costs more.
