REP. JOSEPH MCDADE (R-PA): We are here today to review the FY99 appropriations for the Department of Energy. We're delighted to have the secretary here present with us, a distinguished public servant.
Mr. Secretary, you proceed in your own way, either filing your statement or informally -- whatever suits you. We're glad to have you here, Mr. Secretary.
SEC. FREDERICO PENA: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. My --

REP. MCDADE: Let me interrupt one second. We have a business -- housekeeping thing to take care of, and the chair recognizes the gentleman from California.
REP. VIC FAZIO (D-CA): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Because the Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development is dealing with national security and other sensitive matters at its hearing on atomic energy and defense activity, I move that the hearings on the 17th and 18th of March be held in (closed session?).
REP. MCDADE: The chair will put the question. The roll call is -- the clerk will call the roll.
(Clerk calls the roll.).
REP. MCDADE: -- (inaudible) -- hearing is closed. Mr. Secretary, you're recognized.
SEC. PENA: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Let me first offer my formal testimony for the record, and I have, I hope, a much briefer opening comment to help us start the hearing.
Mr. Chairman, it has been almost a year since I last appeared before you as the newly sworn-in secretary of Energy. I remember right after I was sworn in, I had six hearings within a period of I think a week or two. Let me first thank you and the members of the subcommittee who have actively helped us to address the many challenges facing the Department of Energy.
This morning, let me talk about three particular areas. First I want to report on several major management improvements and changes that we have made because we had much dialogue about that a year ago. Secondly, let me briefly summarize some of the programmatic accomplishments that we have made this past year. And then third, let me get into some of the specifics in a very broad way of the highlights of the budget request that we have before you.
Let me first address management improvements. And I want to start with this subject, Mr. Chairman and members, because I remember we had an extensive conversation about your concerns and, frankly, my concerns about some of the past management issues in the department. Since 1995, we have reduced our federal work force by nearly 3,000 people, approximately 22 percent.
Contractor employment has declined 29 percent from an all-time high of 148,000 people in 1992 to just over 100,000 this past year. Since I have become the secretary, the department has met both its 1998 and its 1999 target which was outlined in the strategic alignment initiative. In other words, we are over a year ahead of schedule in reducing the work force of the department.

Since 1994, we have completed competitions for eight management and operation contracts worth more than $24 billion. And since I have been secretary, I have directed competitive procurements for every management contract requiring my decision. I recall, we were all concerned about the lack of competition, particularly for the large management and operation contracts. I think we're doing a much better job in that regard.
REP. MCDADE: Mr. Secretary, let me interrupt you because that's one of the issues that we're going to discuss with you. And this committee passed Section 301 last year, which required the department to be competitive on M&O contracts and others unless there are special circumstances. Can you flesh that out for us? How many contracts have come up and how many have been let competitively? If any have been let non-competitively, tell us what they are.
SEC. PENA: Let me -- there are two ways I can discuss this, Mr. Chairman. One is on dollar value and one is on numbers of contracts. Let me at least give you the dollar value.
REP. MCDADE: Please.
SEC. PENA: In 1985, we were -- the department was competing approximately 50 percent on a dollar value of its total contracts. We are now competing 85 percent on a dollar value of our contracts. So we have made a significant improvement over those period of years.
As respects my tenure as secretary, on the M&O contracts, where I think that has been most of the concern -- on the non-M&O contracts, I think the record is we're almost at 90 percent competition on the non- M&O contracts. But on the big M&O contracts, first was the -- as you know, I took action to replace the Brookhaven operation, which had been in place for 50 years. And I believe I'm the first secretary to have done that. And we competed that one in six months, which was a record. REP. MCDADE: And we congratulate you and supported you in that decision.
SEC. PENA: I appreciate that, Mr. Chairman. Secondly, I've made the decision to compete the National Renewable Laboratory in my home state of Colorado. We have also decided to compete the Bettis (sp) Atomic Laboratory in Pennsylvania. There were some questions about that, but we think that's the right thing to do. So on those three major contracts, we have competed those.
There were some that had already been, in a sense, decided prior to the time that I came on board. For example, the Los Alamos contract with the University of California, the previous secretary decided to compete that with some changes in the contract. I followed through with that, made those changes, the off-line provision, et cetera, and that was done.

But essentially, the ones that I have had an opportunity to take on first hand, we have competitively bid those.
REP. MCDADE: Well, you mentioned three specifically.
SEC. PENA: Yes.
REP. MCDADE: If we looked at it from the total number of contracts, with emphasis on M&O contracts, that were issued by the department the last fiscal year or up to today, could you tell us how many were let and how many of those were competitive?
SEC. PENA: In the past 12 months or --
REP. MCDADE: Yeah, from the time we had you here last year till today. Do you have a number, a total number?
SEC. PENA: I could get that for you, Mr. Chairman. Again, I'm doing this by memory. The big one, obviously, was the University of California, but that was already in play when I became the secretary.
REP. MCDADE: Yeah, what's the value of that one? I forget.
SEC. PENA: Two -- I think it's a little -- it's three --
REP. MCDADE: Two or three billion (dollars)?
SEC. PENA: Three different labs. It's a very substantial contract.
REP. MCDADE: Okay. If you can, put it into the record.
SEC. PENA: I'd be happy to do that, Mr. Chairman.
REP. MCDADE: And do it numerically and by dollar value.
SEC. PENA: I'd be happy to do that. Thank you.
I've covered the ones that I have been able to do since I've been secretary. The other major accomplishment was the very successful sale of the Elk Hills Petroleum Reserve, which brought in $3.6 billion, about a billion dollars over the Congressional Budget Office estimate.
We have made substantial improvements in our environmental privatization, both from a procurement, legal and safety and health review proposal -- perspective.
We have taken steps to begin to train our personnel, do a better job of pricing of competitive bid contracts.
And more importantly, we have brought in a new person to head an office of contracting reform and privatization, which I committed to you to do a year ago. This person comes from the private sector. I'll send you his resume so you can see his background. But we're very pleased about his private sector background to help us take control of the privatization efforts, in environmental management in particular.
We have dramatically decreased the amount of money spent on support service contracts. In '94, we spent $700 million. We've reduced that by 247 (million dollars), a 35 percent reduction. However, Mr. Chairman and members, I realize we still have a ways to go. We're making some improvements, but we have much more work to do. One thing we have to do a better job in is ensuring that our contractors who have work with subcontractors are willing to hold people's feet to the fire.
For example, I think I sent a message when we took the action on the Brookhaven National Laboratory, and I think it was heard. Our major contractor at Hanford has recently issued a cure notice to the subcontractor managing the K-Basin. That in past years probably would not have occurred. The same has occurred with the Pit Nine subcontractor, where the contractor there has issued a cure notice to the subcontractor in that very controversial case.
So we're trying to change the way in which we relate to our contractors to ensure that they reform and that they meet our expectations and that they're meeting our guidelines.
We're also trying to, Mr. Chairman, do a better job of project management, integrating our facilities, matching our work force to our evolving missions, increasing the responsibility for environment, safety and health, resolving critical safeguard and security issues, and assuring top-level integration of key crosscutting functions.
We were very impressed with the need to improve our project management. We have just received the report making a number of recommendations on project management. We're going to support those and move on those recommendations. I have tasked the under secretary to increase the integration of our department's research and development programs so that they're more focused.
In addition, the department will be intensifying its evaluation of grant award processes. There were questions raised, for example, in energy efficiency. The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy decided to issue two comprehensive competitive solicitations to attract top technologies in buildings, renewables and in the (energy?) sector. That was a main concern that a number of you had raised last year about lack of competition in energy efficiency. I believe we're now doing that.
Mr. Chairman, let me very quickly just summarize key accomplishments in energy security. We have now published our comprehensive national energy strategy. We're receiving comments. We hope to finalize that in April. In environmental cleanup, we've shut down our nation's largest plutonium processing plant, the Purex plant at Hanford. We did that a year ahead of schedule and $78 million under budget. We have completed the cleanup of a major defense facility in Florida, the Pinellas plant, and that has now been turned over to the community for its use.
In stockpile stewardship, we are now, with the new supercomputers that we have on board, able to certify to the president that our stockpile is safe, secure and reliable without underground testing. We have done that two years in a row. We're making progress on the National Ignition Facility, which is on time and on budget. And for the first time in terms of our work overseas, we are at every one of the 53 known sites in Russia and in the independent -- formerly independent -- newly independent countries to secure material and facilities which previously had not had adequate safeguards. That's a major accomplishment.
In science and technology, we have made a number of breakthroughs. I won't list all of those. Let me just focus on the budget. Our budget request is $17 billion for programs within your jurisdiction. That's a 7 percent increase over '98.
Let me simply remind us all that when you compare previous years and adjust it for inflation, we are 30 percent below our appropriation in 1981 and 20 percent below where we were in 1993. With the $1 billion increase that we're requesting, the increases are primarily in, number one, $156 million to emphasize research and development in renewable energy and nuclear energy. You'll recall that the president's committee -- advisers on science and technology recommended that we as a government invest more in R&D in these areas. We're trying to do that.
We're proposing a $246 million increase for investments in basic science programs and facilities, the (Spalasha ?) Neutron Source, the large hadron collider, the next-generation Internet, and some others. We are also asking for a $421 million increase to fully support our stockpile stewardship programs under the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. And beyond that, we're asking for a $317 million increase to continue our environmental cleanup privatization initiative.
Mr. Chairman and members, let me end with those very brief comments. I wanted to just give you a broad overview of the management improvements we've made, the new ways of doing business; also highlight some of the challenges we still have before us because they're very real; and then summarize the main points of the budget request we have before you. I'm very happy to be here. And again, I want to thank you for the strong support this committee has provided us, and I look forward to working with you in the future.
REP. MCDADE: Mr. Secretary, we thank you. We appreciate very much your summation, which was interesting and detailed. We are pleased to see that you're trying to point the department in a new direction. All of us concluded the first day you came in that that was essential. A lot of people think it's impossible, but we'll keep trying together.
And in that connection, let me just run down some actions the committee took last year and just get a little report from you. Now, we've already discussed Section 301, which required competition in contracting by law, and you've alluded to that in your opening statement so we won't go back to that.
Section 302 required the department to follow the federal acquisition regulations. We discovered and informed the department and we talked about it, that because of the history of the department, you were exempt from following those procurement regulations. Are you now following those procurement regulations?
SEC. PENA: Mr. Chairman, I believe we are doing our very best to follow those regulations. Again, I'd be happy to give you a more detailed answer in terms of particular projects, but we are doing our best to make sure that we are complying with that directive.
REP. MCDADE: Okay. We put a waiver section in, you recall, so that if you had to go out in circumstances that were appropriate, let's say, to the history of the department, you didn't have to comply with the federal acquisition regulations. When you send some information to the committee, tell us how many times you've used that waiver provision and make a justification for each one of them, please.
SEC. PENA: I'd be happy to do that, Mr. Chairman.
REP. MCDADE: Mr. Secretary, Section 303 prohibited the use of funds to provide enhanced severance payments and other benefits to certain federal employees. Was that prohibition followed?
SEC. PENA: To the best of my knowledge, it was, Mr. Chairman. But I'll double-check and get you a more specific answer.

REP. MCDADE: Please. We want to be specific about it.
Section 304 limited $61 million in funds that can be used to pay enhanced severance payments and other benefits to contractor employees and provide community assistance grants. Has Section 304 been followed?
SEC. PENA: Mr. Chairman, I'll give you a very specific answer on that also.
REP. MCDADE: Okay. Let's go to Section 305, which prohibited the department from initiating RFPs for a program if the program was not yet even funded. Has the department followed that prohibition?
SEC. PENA: I believe we have, Mr. Chairman.
REP. MCDADE: Okay. Now, we've alluded to this, Mr. Secretary. I want to get a little more detail from you. As you know and as you've referred to, we provided additional funding for the department for an independent assessment of the construction project management system and independent cost validations for individual projects. You've obviously complied with that section of the act and you've used the money, we hope, wisely. And I'd like you to tell us a little bit about what you've done in terms of cost validation and making us comfortable about the management system -- to the extent that you can.
SEC. PENA: Mr. Chairman, first of all, let me thank you for that support and that guidance. We fully agree with the notion that we needed to improve in both those areas. We have conducted the report. The National Academy of Sciences has made that report to us. We will, first of all, have 34 of the top projects they identified which will begin at least initial independent assessments. I think by April of this year, we'll follow up on the others. But this whole notion of having additional reviews of these cost estimates by outside experts is one that we fully embrace.
Beyond that, we also believe it is very important that we do a much better job of estimating pricing in particular for competitive contracts, which means we must do a better job of getting design estimates of a larger proportion of a project before we proceed. Let me be more specific. We realize that in past projects, only perhaps 5 or 10 percent of design was done, and then we made an estimate of what the project would cost, and we subsequently learned we were off by a large factor. So we are now changing that and doing a much more intense design review to get a better handle on long-term costs before we commit ourselves to a longer-term project.
Thirdly, I have tasked the leadership in headquarters to personally review performance-based contracts because in the past it was my view that much of this work was being done in the field without much guidance. We have now issued guidance to our field managers.
We are improving our training, but more importantly, we're reviewing those estimates and that work in headquarters. We have also reconstituted the secretary's board, which had been in existence for many years, but for some reason had been discontinued. Now we bring all of our top people and we review major projects, like the National Ignition Facility, the Spalasha Neutron Source and others, to make sure that all the top managers in the department are focused on these very large projects to ensure that the department is using its best expertise and judgment.
And of course, I've talked already about what will be done in the area of privatization with the new office we've created.
REP. MCDADE: Yeah, and we're glad to hear that because the history, not on your watch, but the history of the lack of coordination of those major projects and the cost explosion was very disturbing to us, and we're glad to see that you're taking it on head- on.
Mr. Secretary, Section 501, you can answer for the record. That's the prohibition against using any dollars appropriated to lobby the Congress. And I'm sure you're complying with that.
SEC. PENA: Yes, sir.
REP. MCDADE: We're glad to hear that.
Mr. Secretary, let's go back now to support services, an area that is of great interest to the committee. And you indicated that after we directed the department through the conferees to be careful about those contracts, pay more attention to them and focus on what ought to be inherently governmental functions and not contract them out -- we would like to hear how that's proceeding, because there's a lot of money on the table, you remember, and the department had been in the past engaging in contracting out what are clearly inherent governmental functions. Would you comment on that again, please, Mr. Secretary?
SEC. PENA: I will, Mr. Chairman. First of all, let me say that I personally verified the truth of the statement and your observations. Let me tell the members how I do that. I don't use my private elevator. I use the elevator in the building, so I walk in with everybody else. And when I walk into the building, I ask people -- I introduce myself and I ask them who they are and what they do. And from the very first day that I got there, I got to meet a lot of contractors who were working in the building, and I was surprised that every day I would meet someone who was a contractor. And very quickly, I understood we had a problem. And so we agree that we've got too many contractors working in our building.
So we take this very seriously, Mr. Chairman. I've talked to you about the 35 percent reduction in support services and in that kind of contracting which ought to be done in house, or if we're not going to do it in house, we're not going to do it at all. So we're going to continue to work on this; we're going to reduce those costs even more. I'm very concerned about what appears to be a practice that had been in the department for some time.
REP. MCDADE: We're very grateful for your direction in that end, Mr. Secretary. We believed in this committee that that was a glaring error, and we're glad to hear that you're complying with it. And I'm thrilled to hear you use your own elevator -- the public elevator.
SEC. PENA: Public one, right.
REP. MCDADE: It's a great way to find out what's going on.
SEC. PENA: It's amazing what you learn.
REP. MCDADE: You bet.
REP. FAZIO: Energy conservation.
REP. MCDADE: Beg your pardon?
REP. FAZIO: I said energy conservation.
(Laughter.)
REP. MCDADE: Mr. Secretary, you've in your statement detailed the changes that you're attempting to effect within the department in guiding it to serve the national interest. As you look ahead, would you spend a few minutes and detail for the committee what you believe are the major priorities that you have as you look downstream to try to make the department more effective as a national instrument?
SEC. PENA: Mr. Chairman, let me share with you what I believe to be our biggest challenge. And it has to do with the work that we do in cleanup of our sites around the country. And I can spend time talking about others, but this is the big one.
It is my view that for reasons that are historical and I'm sure had very legitimate bases, the department entered into commitments with a number of states to reach certain cleanup standards within a certain time frame and in a certain way. Many of those agreements were reached almost 10 years ago, in some cases. The department is still having problems meeting those milestones for a number of reasons.
Number one, the work that we're doing in many cases is not being done anywhere else in the world. When we go into tanks, for example, at Hanford and we discover a concrete block in a tank that nine years ago no one would have anticipated we would have found, that's a kind of unexpected problem that no one can anticipate. When in doing work at one of our other facilities, we discover that there are toxic gases which are being developed in the work there, no one could have contemplated that.
So we have a very serious challenge in trying to clean up these properties using, in many case, new technologies which have never been used before, trying to meet time tables that were committed to a long time ago and, as we look into the outyears, a declining budget. So, for example, when we completed the accelerated closure plan, and we've now had that out for comment, the goal was to try to clean as many sites by 2006 or 2010, et cetera, and we projected over the long term what the costs were going to be, we have a very significant budget shortfall to do that.
It is my view, after having spent time with a number of governors who are concerned about this, some of whom are now, to be very candid, arguing that if we don't meet those milestones, they will close their borders and not allow us to move material into their sites, which in my view will shut down the entire system nationwide for we're trying to ship materials across the country. It is my view that what we have is a national consensus on how we're going to deal with this cleanup in the long term.
And that means bringing in the key governors from the key states, having an understanding with the Congress about what are going to be the long-term funding commitments. Obviously, the department has to be committed to better management to ensure that we're using those dollars wisely so we don't make the mistakes we've made in the past. But trying to reach a consensus on how we're going to proceed. And that will mean, in my view, agreements by states to work with us, to in some cases accept certain streams of waste so that we can reduce the overall national cost to the entire complex.
Mr. Chairman, I see this as a national priority because the work that was done at these sites was on behalf of our national security. And therefore I think it is our national responsibility as Americans to respond to the cleanup problems of those Americans who are now concerned about these wastes in their home states. That I think is the most significant management and budgetary challenge we have in the future, and I look forward to working with you to try to find an answer to that problem.
REP. MCDADE: Mr. Secretary, let me ask you, how many governors are directly involved that you have to negotiate with? SEC. PENA: I think we have at least six.
REP. MCDADE: Six of them?
SEC. PENA: There could be others that have other roles but...
REP. MCDADE: Yeah. I know last year, for example, when some of our colleagues appeared from the state of Washington talking about the problem there, we told them just what you said, that the nation has a commitment to those people and that we're going to see it through. It's a very difficult problem, as you know better than anybody. If you had it to do over again, you might not have accepted the job as secretary of Energy.
(Laughter.)
REP. MCDADE: But we're glad you're there. And at this time, I'm pleased to yield to my distinguished friend from California, Mr. Fazio.
REP. FAZIO: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Mr. Secretary, welcome. You're one of very few Americans who has had the privilege of being a Cabinet secretary with two different agencies, and it's obvious your management skills are being sharpened up to the moment. And obviously, you've been very responsive to the concerns the chairman and the committee have had, and I appreciate that.
I'd like to get into some substantive issues immediately, and let me begin with (fuse wrap ?). As you know, in the FY98 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill, we transferred authority to the Corps of Engineers. Could you tell me what the department has done to help the transfer?
SEC. PENA: I'd be happy to, Congressman. First, I think within a couple of weeks, I sent a letter to Secretary Cohen stating that we were transferring the program fully to the Department of Defense. Immediately thereafter, my staff had extensive meetings with the Corps of Engineers to fully explain the program, outline all of the issues that we have pending before us, make sure that we had a smooth handoff because we didn't want to see any of the work slowed down in any way. And I believe the work has essentially kept on pace.
I must say, Congressman Fazio, that there is one issue that has not yet been resolved. It may require additional action on the part of the Congress. And that is the question of who provides regulatory oversight over these matters. As you know, in the past, when fuse wrap was the responsibility of the Department of Energy, we were the self-regulator, and today there is still a legal question, at least according to our lawyers, about who has the responsibility in terms of providing regulatory oversight.
And that may need some additional attention.
REP. FAZIO: So you're currently providing that regulatory oversight?
SEC. PENA: Congressman, at this point, we have transferred the program over to the Department of Defense.
REP. FAZIO: Okay.
SEC. PENA: If you would ask the Corps of Engineers who is providing regulatory oversight, I'm not sure they can answer that question today. There is a little bit of a gap here in terms of deciding who has regulatory authority, and there are some very complex legal and policy questions about who should have that responsibility. But again, we're happy to work with you and others to see how we can correct that problem.
REP. FAZIO: It is your lawyers' opinion, then, that a simple memorandum of understanding would not suffice to transfer the regulatory authority, and that's where you think we need to give you additional legal authority in statute?
SEC. PENA: Congressman, my understanding from our lawyers is as follows. Under current law, the Department of Energy can only in a sense transfer its regulatory authority to a contractor. It cannot transfer that regulatory authority to another government agency or department. And so we need to address that.
Secondly, there is the question of a longstanding policy in the government that these sorts of matters dealing with these kinds of materials would remain in a, quote, 'civilian agency.' And so these are the policy questions which I think have to be addressed. I don't have answers to these questions right now, but, again, we're happy to work with you and others to see how we can correct them. I think they should be corrected.
REP. FAZIO: Well, I appreciate your putting them on our agenda. I think it's something we've got to work together on to see if we can complete the circle here and make sure that we don't leave a gap, a hiatus in obviously a very important area.

Let me ask about the stockpile stewardship program. The committee is being asked to include $4.5 billion for that program. I think it is imperative that we support it. But I do think there are problems both in the general public and on Capitol Hill in fully understanding the importance of it. It's obviously the precondition of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, but it also gives us the scientific capability we need to do everything from do an adequate job of inspecting weapons in Iraq to perhaps dealing with the problem of rogue nations like North Korea.
But it seems to me that we could do more, the administration could do more to make the public aware of why we're making this kind of expenditure. For members who have been traditional supporters of testing, we need to build their confidence, and for those who oppose testing, we need to build theirs. Is there going to be something, frankly, that will help educate the Congress and the public and make this committee's task more easy to accomplish?
SEC. PENA: Congressman Fazio, the answer is yes. And we have started that process, but more needs to be done. When the president submitted the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to the Senate for ratification, we then started participating in some hearings -- Senator Domenici had one hearing; I believe others are planned -- and some public outreach to begin to educate the Congress, the American people about our stockpile stewardship program.
If I might, let me just briefly say that when we first made the estimate of the cost for stockpile stewardship, it was about $4 billion. That was done in 1995. Today our estimate is that it will cost $4.5 billion. Why?
We are committed, since it has been five years since we have conducted nuclear tests in our country, not to have any more underground testing under the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. In order to do that, the three laboratory directors have advised us that they need additional tools and technologies to allow them to make the same judgment about our weapons as we used to do.
Secretary Cohen and I just a month ago certified to the Congress, and this is the second year in a row we have done this, that our nuclear stockpile is in fact safe, secure and reliable without underground testing. Our scientists, however, have told us that in future years as the weapons age, we will need the National Ignition Facility; we will need computers that do 100 trillion operations per second by around the year 2004.
We will need some additional capacities -- capabilities, rather -- as our engineers begin to retire in part of the next decade and to use that computer simulation to take the data from the past 1,000 tests we have conducted, simulate that and then use that information with the new engineers we're bringing on board to continue to maintain our stockpiles safely and securely without testing.

That is the message that you're asking that we need to communicate to the American people and others about why this program is so important. And we need to do a better job in communicating that message.
REP. FAZIO: Well, I appreciate that. I think Vic Reese (sp) has the confidence of many on this committee, if not all. But I think, as you have indicated, this is a job for you and Secretary Cohen. And we look forward to having that effort made because I do think we've got to build far more public support than exists.
Let me go to the global climate technology initiative. There's $2.7 billion in new technology funding requested and 3.6 billion (dollars) in tax increases -- or pardon me, incentives. They're not increases. That's over the next five years. But I think, I'm sure even within this committee, there remains a good deal of skepticism about the scientific basis upon which the global warming debate has thus been carried.
But I understand that you believe that for purposes of industrial competitiveness, for general reasons of quality air and even national security and electric restructuring, there are reasons to proceed on these initiatives even if you put aside the continuing debate about global warming. Would you speak to why you believe this committee should bear its burden, its share of the total and why you think this is important to do on more than simply grounds of scientific evidence about global warming?
SEC. PENA: I'd be happy to, Congressman. Setting aside global climate change, if one reviews the recommendations of the President's Committee of Science Advisers, who are a relatively distinguished group of Americans who have looked at our research and development investments as a country and compared them to other countries, they have strongly recommended that in energy research and development we invest more.
In fact, they recommended dollar amounts that are fairly similar to those the president has proposed. And they have recommended this to accomplish more energy security so that we are less reliant on imported oil. They have recommended this to reduce cost to consumers. They have recommended these investments in order to deal with environmental challenges in addition to the other two matters I've described.
And so you'll see that as respects the Department of Energy, the dollars that we are asking for for '99 build on programs that we have already had: in renewable energy, in energy efficiency, in breakthrough technologies that are so important, like fuel cells, which are going to be key to the development of new cars. I think the only area, and it's a relatively small amount of money that we have requested in '99 that is, in a sense, a new type of program, is in carbon sequestration, which, frankly, will help U.S. companies today that are concerned about their carbon emissions. So for all those reasons, even if we did not have a Kyoto protocol to deal with, and as you know, we have not submitted that to the Senate for ratification yet because we don't have meaningful participation on the part of developing countries, I believe these are things we ought to be doing anyway. We ought to be using our energy more efficiently, we ought to be driving down costs for the American consumer, we ought to be finding a way to be less dependent on foreign oil. And for all those reasons, I think these investments, supported by the scientists of our country, are very wise for the future of our economy and for the future of our well-being as Americans.
REP. FAZIO: In this regard, could you give the committee your reasons for asking for the Million Solar Roofs Initiative to be adopted? And how is that going to operate?
SEC. PENA: Frankly, Congressman, it is operating surprisingly well. The president issued a challenge, I think when he spoke to the United Nations last year, to by the year 2010 have a million solar roofs and solar facilities installed throughout the country. We then started reaching out to utilities and others, and we have essentially received feedback from a number of these, such as, for example, Sacramento Utility District in California, who I think is committed to do 20,000 themselves, which already are close to the 500,000 mark. So we're about halfway there. So I feel very confident that we're probably going to surpass the one-million mark.
But we're asking for additional funds here to help in certain areas bring down the cost of certain technologies and, in particular, help us do some breakthrough technologies that we think will be more market-oriented so that we can, generally speaking, see a much more -- a greater infusion of solar and wind and other technologies throughout the economy. But I think we're doing fairly well and I feel very confident we're going to meet that goal.
REP. FAZIO: I heard the word 'fusion' as part of a word you used there. I'll take that as a segue to my last question, Mr. Chairman. And that is the fusion program.
The department's proposed increases in FY99 for energy research are premised, in part at least, on the PCAST (ph) report. But in fact, the PCAST report and the department's own Fusion Energy Advisory Committee have recommended a $250 million, or a $20 million increase, for fusion energy sciences for '99. Could you reconcile the decision that was made, obviously a budgetary decision, to not support the recommendations of those two agencies?
SEC. PENA: Congressman, I think perhaps we need to explain what we've done in fusion a little better. As I understand it, in the past fiscal year, we've had a significant contribution to the EATER (ph) program.
This year we have significantly reduced that contribution, and so we're taking that base money that was used for EATER and transferring it over to the fusion program. And that perhaps we did not clarify in the budget. So in that sense, we have I think solidified our work in fusion, given the transfer we have made away from the EATER program. But I can give you much more information about that.
REP. FAZIO: If you would, for the record.
SEC. PENA: I'd be happy to.
REP. FAZIO: I'm sure it would be of interest to the community that's very concerned about this funding level. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
REP. MCDADE: The chair recognizes the distinguished gentleman from Kentucky.
REP. HAROLD ROGERS (R-KY): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Secretary, it's certainly good to see you here. I want to take you back to the stockpile stewardship program because you're asking for this year, for '99, 2.188 billion (dollars). That's an increase of 330 million (dollars), almost 18 percent above the current appropriation. So obviously, it's a big expenditure and expensive.
I'm looking for some assurance that the computer simulations will work. As you, I'm sure, have read, there was a recent story in 'The National Journal,' where many nuclear scientists say that it's very complex -- highly complex, very expensive, as we're saying, and no one can say with confidence whether the goals of the program can actually be attained. So what I'm looking for is assurance from you and from -- pardon me, but some nuclear scientists --
SEC. PENA: Absolutely.
REP. ROGERS: -- that can give us some assurance that this will work because we have a lot riding on this, not just money, obviously. Money is the least of the things that could happen if it does not work. So can you help me out?
SEC. PENA: I will try my very best, Congressman. And you're absolutely right. I think it is always very helpful to directly from the scientists and from the laboratory directors, and I spend a lot of time with them because I ask the very same questions. And the reason I ask those questions is because I have to sign my name on the annual certification to the Congress and to the American people, together with the secretary of Defense, that our nuclear stockpile is in fact safe, secure and reliable without doing underground testing. And we have to do that on annual basis. And so I have spent a lot of time with our scientists and our laboratories understanding the processes they use.
Let me try to answer your question. As respects the supercomputing capabilities that our scientists need, we are making remarkable progress. In December of 1996, the department announced, for the first time in the history of the world, a one-trillion operation-per-second supercomputer. By the end of this year, we will take that up to three trillion operations per second. We have issued a contract to take that then to 10 trillion operations per second, then 30 trillion operations per second and then to a hundred trillion operations per second.
Now, to a layman like myself, when people tell me that we're going to make these leapfrog advances in computers, I pause. Obviously, those are gargantuan increases in supercomputing capability. The response that I hear from our scientists is that we are meeting our goals. No one thought that we would be at the three trillion operations per second this year. It was originally estimated we would not be there until the next century. So, so far, they have been very optimistic about the supercomputing capabilities and our ability to meet those targets.
And let me emphasize one point because I think this is very important. Please remember that your Department of Energy is the world superpower in supercomputers. No other country in the world is close to us. And we need to continue to keep that lead, in my judgment, not just for our stockpile stewardship capabilities, but because it has enormous applications to the private sector and to the work we do in other aspects of our society.
So thus far, the laboratory directors and those who work on supercomputers feel very good about the supercomputing program.
As you stated, there are other aspects to the stockpile stewardship program, the National Ignition facility and some other tools. And the questions that I ask our scientists are, do we have a high degree of confidence that when those facilities are built -- and thus far, the National Ignition Facility is on budget and on time -- we will have the kind of capability we need to be able to certify to the president and to you that our nuclear stockpile is safe, secure and reliable?
Thus far, they are saying the answer is yes. But this will be an annual certification, and anytime that I or, I believe, any future secretary of Energy or secretary of Defense, based on the certifications that we get from our laboratory directors, have any information that somehow we cannot continue this program because we need to revert back to underground testing, we would not sign the certifications to the American people and to the Congress.
REP. ROGERS: Well, in 'The National Journal' article that I mentioned, there's a quote in there, and I'm quoting: 'There's not a man or woman involved in stockpile stewardship willing to say with certainty whether the goal of the program is attainable.' Unquote. Is that a fair statement?
SEC. PENA: Well, if the question is, can anyone sit here today and say that in the year 2010, the stockpile stewardship program will be a success without underground testing, I don't think anyone is going to come up here and give you that kind of a definitive answer. I think what they will tell you is that the program thus far is on track. We are now in our second year of certification. We are on track with the technologies that we need to develop. And the safeguard, I think it's safeguard F in the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the fallback, is that if any future year any future scientists, laboratory directors or secretaries of Energy or Defense have information that does not allow us to make that certification, the certification will not be made.
REP. ROGERS: Well, let me try to clarify this. As I understand it, Mr. Secretary, the presidential directive which established the stockpile stewardship program provided for the commander-in-chief to issue a, quote, 'supreme national interest,' unquote, waiver to nuclear testing if the secretaries of Defense and Energy and the joint chiefs and the U.S. Strategic Command certify that the stockpile is not safe and reliable. And yet the administration is urging the Senate to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. So the question arises, suppose the Senate ratified the treaty, could that 'supreme national interest' clause of the presidential directive still be invoked with the treaty in force to allow nuclear testing?
SEC. PENA: Yes. And the way it would be invoked is under I believe it's safeguard F, which is part of the treaty submitted to the Senate, is that in the future, if the annual certification could not be made, then the president would have the authority to exercise, in effect, the waiver of national security and argue that the country should go back and resume underground testing.
REP. ROGERS: When do you -- under the program now in place, when will we get to the point where we can be assured that the stockpile can be certified as not only safe, but armed and effective without nuclear testing?
SEC. PENA: We are there today, Congressman. We have made that certification last year. We've made that certification this year. And based on the information that I have before me, we expect to make it next year. So thus far, we are two years into this annual certification. And if I might, let me just spend a minute to explain how I do it. And I can give you a little sense of how the secretary of Defense does it. First of all, the laboratory directors, each three of -- each one of them, evaluate the work of their own scientists. And what we are doing with our weapons is, in effect, inspecting them with more precision than we used to do. And that means taking apart on a sampling basis each of the components of a weapon. And in the event that we find a problem, we then can correct it. And thus far, we have been able to do that.
After they have done that and after they have made their own certifications, they then send their certifications to me. The Nuclear Weapons Council then meets and reviews those certifications from the laboratory directors. They then make a recommendation to me, and then I make my own independent certification.
Parallel to my work is the work done by the secretary of Defense. He has his own parallel process where he uses STRATCOM, General Habiger. General Habiger has his own separate advisers of either former lab directors and other scientists who give him advice. They make their determination and then they send their separate certification. And then he and I literally sign the same document, indicating that our own independent views here allow us to certify to the Congress that our nuclear weapons complex is safe, secure and reliable without underground testing.
So in a sense, we check each other. And anywhere along the line, if either one of us were not able to make that certification, then the provision of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, Safeguard F, would be triggered.
REP. ROGERS: I'm a little bit confused. I think you earlier said that there's no way you can a thousand percent certify, based on present knowledge, that the stockpile is safe and reliable.
SEC. PENA: No, Congressman. You were asking me a question about the future. And I answered the question about can I today make that prediction about the year 2010? And this is an annual certification process; we do it every year. And so we have annually certified last year and this year that, in fact, our nuclear stockpile is safe, secure and reliable without testing. And we have made that certification.
REP. ROGERS: How can you say that? How can you say it's safe and reliable without testing when the supercomputing operation is not quite yet ramped up to race track speed?
SEC. PENA: Because we don't need them today.
We will need that supercomputing capability in approximately the year 2004, 2005, 2006, because at that time the weapons material will be aging and we will need that new technology to make predictions about materials in the weapons in that time frame with this new technology. But we do not need that technology today to make the certifications.
REP. ROGERS: Why not?
SEC. PENA: Because, number one, we have weapons which are not as old. We have the information from about a thousand nuclear tests that were done before. We have better information based on our physical inspection and surveillance of the weapons, which is now done much more thoroughly and much more robustly than in the past. And we have the capability to make adjustments to those materials as we find them.
So based on all these techniques that we use today on a system of weapons that is not, quote, 'aged,' compared to where they might be 10 or 15 or 20 years from now, all of our scientists and engineers in the laboratories are able to certify to me and others that our stockpile is safe, secure and reliable without underground testing. And that is the point that I'm making about this is an annual certification process, and we have to do it and repeat it every year and reach the same level of certainty. Otherwise, we will not make the certification.
REP. ROGERS: Thank you.
REP. MCDADE: The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Texas.
REP. CHET EDWARDS (D-TX): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm going to ask a couple of questions, Mr. Secretary, as long as my voice holds out. But I'll follow up with written questions if necessary. But I would like to focus on the issue of nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. And I first want to commend you for your efforts in dealing with getting our arms around the nuclear situation in the former Soviet states.
Having said that, though, I'm bothered by the disconnect between the president saying that the issue of nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction is a national emergency, and then looking at page 56 of your budget report, which in the area of nonproliferation and national security has a freeze in three different areas: nonproliferation and verification R[D] intelligence; and security investigations.
You know, when we can up the highway budget by 10 or 20 or 30 billion dollars when we decide to, if we can provide hundreds of millions of dollars of increases in requests for non-renewable -- or for, rather, renewable energy resources, all of which are important programs, it seems to me that when literally the lives of American civilians living in the United States are at risk to a terrorist today, especially from chemical and biological weapons, why has the administration been so tepid in its response to what it has called a national emergency?
SEC. PENA: Congressman, it is my judgment that we have not been tepid, if I might respond to your question directly. We have asked -- and I -- as I learn more about our work, for example, in Russia and in the newly independent states, in the sites where we are doing work, which is going well, it's a relatively new program. And I asked the question, we're now in 53 sites, how many more sites can we be in?
The answer is these are all the known sites that have been made publicly available to us, or at least that we know about, where we have this challenge of securing those sites. We're in every one of those sites. So until we learn that there are more sites -- and it could be that in two or three years, we learn that there's another site someplace, the money that we have for that program is what is needed to get that work done.
There are other -- in the arms control part of our budget, there are some additional funds for nonproliferation and verification which I think we need to bring to your attention, Congressman. So I think when you look at all aspects of our budget, you will see that I think we've got a fairly healthy commitment to this whole area of nonproliferation and verification. But let me get that in a more precise way so we'll have a fuller understanding of what our total budget looks like.
REP. EDWARDS: And Mr. Secretary, as I said in prefacing my question, I think you've done a good job with your resources in regard to nuclear proliferation. But I think we -- or probably less than a tepid response to the national emergency of potential threats to not only our forces abroad, but civilians, you know, right here at home to biological and chemical weapons. And a freeze in three accounts does not seem to me like a national emergency response.
Let me ask you this specific question. If a terrorist from abroad were to get enough anthrax that would fill this water jug and this afternoon, either via truck with aerosol spray or the Cessna 172, fly over Washington, D.C., and release this amount of anthrax, again applied with aerosol on Washington, D.C., what would happen and what would be our response? And do we have the antidotes to in any way save the lives of absolutely millions of people who could die? SEC. PENA: That's right. The results would be catastrophic, Congressman. We have recently had discussions not only in my department, but throughout the administration about how we can with all the departments involved dealing, first of all, with our intelligence gathering operations, which are the best defense in trying to anticipate and identify potential individuals who might be engaged in --
REP. EDWARDS: And you have a freeze in your intelligence budget request.
SEC. PENA: There are other departments, Congressman, who are responsible for that aspect of this entire program. To the Department of Defense, which also has responses in this area, to FEMA, which has jurisdiction in terms of coordinating responses if there were a problem, to the technology that we are developing in the Department of Energy, where for example, in Iraq we provided to our armed forces technologies that can predict the plume of a biological release so that we can warn our troops that in 15 minutes, a plume will be coming your way, which is our responsibility, we have made better efforts to coordinate all the work in the administration in the area of biological and chemical weapons, which you're right, the president has declared three years in a row as a national priority.
So I think compared to where we were three years ago, we are, both in terms of budgetary response and overall government coordination, focused intensely on this issue because it is a very high priority.
Let me, if I might, give you additional information in writing about other budget categories we have in our overall department which will respond to the questions you have raised.
REP. EDWARDS: Could you specifically respond to the question of what would we do if this amount of anthrax were spread throughout any major city in the United States?
And I'll finish, Mr. Secretary, with a comment. I'm not just being critical of the administration. I think Congress has had its attention focused on the nuclear issue from the day I was in grade school in the Cuban missile crisis. So Congress and the administrations of the past responded to this generation of fear of nuclear fallout, but I think we're missing the boat. And I think the answer to my question is there's not a heck of a lot we would be able to do today if this amount of anthrax were spread over Washington, D.C., given that I understand intelligence is one way to prevent that.
But I look forward to working with you some more on this, and hopefully, you know, this has to be a team effort. We in Congress have to make a priority of this as well. Mr. Chairman, thank you for your time.

SEC. PENA: Mr. Chairman, if I could just on that note invite the members to a display of technology that we will have -- it was on the House side yesterday and I believe it'll be on the Senate side tomorrow -- which has a number of the technologies that DOE is now using, experimenting, for example, with New York City on some LYDAR(?) equipment, et cetera, so you can get a sense of some of the technologies that we're developing, particularly to deal with chemical and biological releases in our country and how we can detect them.
REP. MCDADE: We appreciate that. And we understand -- (inaudible).
The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.
REP. JOE KNOLLENBERG (R-MI): Mr. Secretary, how are you?
SEC. PENA: Fine.
REP. KNOLLENBERG: Speaking of elevators, we rode up on one just the other day, as I remember. It was a general, generic elevator.
SEC. PENA: That's right.
(Laughter.)
REP. KNOLLENBERG: Sometimes it doesn't work. I want to very quickly ask you, and I do appreciate your coming and your testimony, and I want to focus on a concern that I had with respect to the vacancy of the assistant secretary of Environmental Management. That position has not been filled. It's been vacated since the fall.
SEC. PENA: January -- no, January, sir.
REP. KNOLLENBERG: I recall the -- I recall it was back in November that I got the call. Now, perhaps -- did he not remove himself or was he not removed before the beginning of the year?
SEC. PENA: I'll go back and look at my records.
REP. KNOLLENBERG: Take a look at it.
SEC. PENA: I think he --
REP. KNOLLENBERG: I'm just concerned, more significantly, though, who is in the wings? Who are you considering? I know you have an interim individual. Interim suggests that that's exactly what they are, they're interim. They're not positioned certainly.
Do you have someone in mind, or is that expected shortly?
SEC. PENA: Congressman, let me assure you that this is -- we have a number of issues we're dealing with in terms of personnel in the department. This is right at the top. I think this is perhaps one of the most difficult jobs in the government today. And the fact is that in the many interviews I've had with a number of individuals, and we're in particular trying to find someone who has private sector experience, who understands how to deal with complex projects, who understands how to work with the private sector, who knows how to get these kinds of things done, which is a unique experience --
REP. KNOLLENBERG: So you do intend to make the appointment as soon as possible? You're looking at it and --
SEC. PENA: Absolutely, Congressman. We're working on it and interviewing lots of people.
REP. KNOLLENBERG: Let me go to a point about -- that is very important to me. You and I have talked about this both here last year and during the year. It has to do with the bringing to closure of some of these individual sites. And in particular, I want to focus on Rocky Flats. As you and I have discussed, we have a lot to gain by bringing to closure these locations because, frankly, in the long run, we save a great deal of money. That's obviously an advantage for you and for us and for the country.
Now, I'm stacking some books up in front of me. I know that when I first became a member of this subcommittee, we got the 1995 BEMR (?). That was a -- I think that's what we call this guy right here. And there were three volumes and that kind of disturbed me, but I thought, well, okay, three volumes.
Then we had the 1996 BEMR (?), and that's this guy. It's like, in terms of weight, it's more than double.
And then I have the 1998 -- there was nothing in '97. The '98 now has some 12 volumes that are packaged inside this little band here. And I'm beginning to wonder if this thing is getting more difficult or simpler. Apparently, it's getting more difficult.
When I first -- when I look also at some of the reports within each of these, '95, '96 or '98, are talking about a 75-year projection for bringing these things to closure. And incidentally, in 1996, that was one volume more than '95, and they reduced the projection from 230 billion (dollars) to 227 (billion dollars). We just received the DOE draft report -- that's this right here, which involved -- or rather, revolved and evolved from the 10-year plan, and this report is made up of about a dozen volumes. And I would say that it provides that we'll spend about 189 billion (dollars) over a 75-year period. That's a 38 billion (dollars) reduction.
Now, if I were to make an observation from all this, that for every volume that we add to the EM cleanup plan, we save about 3 billion (dollars). So one of the things I might suggest, and I do this humorously, go back and bring forth a hundred volumes of this kind and we'll be done with the whole thing, it'll be over.
(Laughter.)
REP. KNOLLENBERG: I know that's not possible, but -- now we can move the books. Thank you.
We're still concerned about this whole draft program. That's just for illustrative purposes, but you see what we have to decipher, and yet we still haven't brought to an end anything but a 75-year projection. We -- you would let us know or were going to let us know when we might expect the completed report on accelerating the cleanup and also what's your analysis of the entire EM program was.
I'm concerned about this, and I just mention it to you, because I know a year ago, you mentioned to me in this meeting, same meeting, that with respect to Rocky Flats, you expect to see that come to closure by the year 2006. That's in the record.
And I know that the pass to closure, the closure plan, assumes a funding baseline of 6 billion (dollars) for 1999. But the administration only requested 5.78 billion (dollars). I have to wonder, did the DOE find some additional savings somewhere in order to come in with that figure that's under 6 billion (dollars)? And would you respond? Because I think that's valid. I think that, yeah, 6 billion (dollars) for '99 was what the closure plan projected, but you've come in at 5.78 (billion dollars). I have a reason for asking this because there's a follow-up question to that. Why is the DOE amount less than the level of funding that was anticipated?
SEC. PENA: Congressman, I know that when we did pass to closure in that multi-year analysis, we had assumed for estimating purposes that we would have 5.75 billion (dollars) every year, I believe for the next 10 years.
If we look at the current outlay numbers, we're not going to have $5.75 billion per year. Under -- and of course, outlay numbers are outlay numbers and we know that every year is a different budget. The point that we were trying to make in that document is that overall we're going to have a funding shortfall over a period of years if we want to meet the targets that we've outlined in this new strategy. And it was illustrative, but I think the good thing about this work is that we now have a closure strategy for each one of the projects in the country, and I think that is a first. So hopefully, that will give us some guidance about how to proceed. But let me get back to you and answer this.
REP. KNOLLENBERG: Let me share some information with you that I received in a meeting last week with some of the contractors at Rocky Flats. They gave us a pretty compelling chart, and I'm going to ask that the chart be circulated, that suggested that -- how many projects they anticipate they will not be able to complete due to the reduced level of funding. Does everybody have that chart? Because it's a three-column affair and it has three columns with the various projects. The first column demonstrates how much will be completed if we had and continued to fully fund Rocky Flats to the so-called pass- to-closure draft for Fiscal Years 98, 99 and 2000. But even under this funding scenario, Rocky Flats would not be closed until 2010.
Now, the second column, which is a shorter list of projects, demonstrates again how many will be completed if we increase the funding level to, again, the pass-to-closure draft levels. This scenario places closure by 2010 in jeopardy, and yet the DOE request, as I've said, is below this amount.
And the third column demonstrates how many projects will be completed if we only fund Rocky Flats at the reduced DOE request level for those years '97 -- I beg your pardon, '98, '99 and 2000. And it virtually guarantees, if it is valid, that we won't be able to close the Rocky Flats site by 2010. And you can see how many fewer projects will be completed under the reduced funding scenario.
And again, I want to stress, even if we had fully funded Rocky Flats at the pass-to-closure level, the contractors stated they would be able to close by 2010. They're not even discussing the year 2006. So I would like you to respond. Do you still believe that we'll be able to complete the cleanup of Rocky Flats by the year 2006?
SEC. PENA: Congressman, that is certainly our goal. And let me be very specific about Rocky Flats since I have spent some time on this subject. There are legitimate differences of opinion, and I respect those, between the views of the contractor, between the views of our field operation and headquarters. And I have asked my team to come to final closure about those legitimate differences of opinion.
We all are on the same page in the sense that we want to hit the 2006 goal. That has not changed. I have not changed my view about that. No one in EM has changed their view about that.
But, as I said, I think there are some legitimate questions. For example, how do you quantify the value of the vault that is not going to be built at Rocky, but is going to be built at Savannah River? It is for the benefit of Rocky, but we don't carry the value of that vault in the Rocky budget. So if you look at the Rocky budget, it looks like it's less. And that was a concern about last year's budget compared to this year's budget, and some would argue we had $7 million less than last year. Well, we didn't count the vault for the budget this year. But building that vault in Savannah will allow us to move the material out of Rocky to Savannah, significantly bringing down the cost to Rocky.
REP. KNOLLENBERG: But you know, Mr. Secretary --
SEC. PENA: That's an example of the kind of question about how you count that number. And that's all I'm saying, there are some legitimate differences of opinion.
But I want to answer your question. Our goal is to clean up Rocky by 2006. We're going to bring these parties together -- there are some differences -- and finally come to closure on what we agree on and then come back to you with a more -- fuller answer.
REP. KNOLLENBERG: It just seems to me that if in this year the -- if we're that short of the amount that's been projected to be needed to bring it about, the closure in 2006, it would be somewhat scary, I think. And it suggests that why wouldn't we fully fund that closure? I think on that sheet, it indicates the three different levels of funding for the three different areas of projects that would be covered. And I think this committee has some concerns about completing cleanup. I know that I do.
And I think if we could just for once bring one of those huge locations to closure -- I mean, this is your home state. It's Rocky Flats, it's Boulder, it's Denver. And I've traveled there, as you know, and been there to look the situation over, and it seems that everybody is together.
SEC. PENA: That's right.
REP. KNOLLENBERG: The city, the community, the state, the environmentalists, almost everyone feels, as far as I know, that let's do it. And it would seem to me, if we could just concentrate on doing that, we could show the country, the world that we're done. And I'm just concerned about some of these numbers that don't add up.
And I know that it's difficult to maybe make some projections, but I think what we have to do is get some answers on this so that if there are problems, maybe we can intercede in some fashion to help you. I know you want to bring this about, and we've talked about that. So I would just urge you -- and I guess I'm over my time -- to put some heavy emphasis on that, to bring in somebody to take that position as soon as possible, and we can get on together.
So thank you.
SEC. PENA: Congressman, I agree, and thank you for your support. And we will get back to you with a more specific answer on Rocky, and I could not agree with you more about the overall agreement in Colorado about -- and in our department about bringing this to closure in 2006.
REP. KNOLLENBERG: Thank you.
REP. MCDADE: The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.
REP. ED PASTOR (D-AZ): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, Mr. Secretary. First of all, let me apologize for going back and forth. As you know, we all have two committees going on, and so we apologize -- at least I apologize -- for not being here for the entire hearing.
Two questions, Mr. Chairman. The first one, I see in the -- in your comments, or your testimony that there's an increase for solar and renewable resources technology. And I'm very happy to see that your budget includes 78.8 million (dollars) for photovoltaic, which is an increase of 13.3 million (dollars) from the last year.
Last year, as I recall, most of the money was going into the application and development -- the development you pretty much had done, but the application of the shingles technology. And I wanted to know how that's coming, and then secondly, where you think we're going to go into further research in the department in that area.
SEC. PENA: Congressman Pastor, let me say, you're absolutely right, we had a high priority on the solar shingles. And they're basically out and you can now purchase them, and so people can find them at various stores.
We believe that there is more work to do in the area of solar R&D. I just came back from a visit to the National Renewable Laboratory in Colorado, which is spending a considerable amount of its resources in trying to find more breakthrough technologies for solar. We still want to reduce the costs for certain technologies, and we think that there is great promise there. We are going to do a $10- million competitive solicitation to help us develop and deploy even more promising solar technologies, and that will be 70 percent shared by the private sector. So we think that will be very helpful.
We're also seeking additional money for photovoltaics, which will again be a cost-shared R&D program with industry to again cut down the cost for manufacturing technology and production costs, so those will be more commercial.
So that's the overall strategy that we're using to help us bring down these costs and to help do some of these breakthroughs in cooperation with the private sector so that solar panels, shingles and other technologies will be more available throughout the economy. And I think we're making progress. The One Million Solar Roof Initiative has been very successful thus far. People are quite interested in participating in that, and we've seen just a renewed sense of interest and enthusiasm for the whole solar industry.
REP. PASTOR: As you well know, in the West, especially in -- on the reservations, that you have a poor infrastructure of getting electricity into those areas. Most recently, I was on the Navajo and the Hopi reservations, and they've attempted to address that problem with solar panels. And I think that maybe these shingles might be a possible solution, but like anything else, their resources are very limited. Do you think that you would have in the future some type of incentive program that would help those isolated areas to take advantage of the shingles and also provide further information on whether or not they're working?
SEC. PENA: Congressman, we can provide more additional information to the reservations and we're happy to do that. In addition, there are tax credits that are available in this area that the president's proposed. So there are a number of different techniques that can be used here to encourage people to move in this direction, particularly in a very isolated area.
I've been informed that one utility in Southern California is now finding that it is more cost-effective themselves to install a solar panel, for example, in a certain community because it is far more expensive to rip up the pavement and install long lines to get to certain areas, and it also helps them deal with the base load problem they have during the day when most electricity is being used in that part of the country. So we're finding the private sector itself and some of the utilities themselves are now realizing that in certain unique circumstances, it is helpful to their bottom line to actually provide these technologies to some of their customers.
But let me follow up on your particular request and see if we can have some people engage with the individuals you're referring to.
REP. PASTOR: As a short reminder, as you know, at Arizona State University, we have a facility that does a lot of research. And as you continue your research and development for photovoltaic, hopefully you'll take them under consideration because they're ready to help in any way they can.
The second question deals with the laboratories. I know that in areas that are close to the laboratories, you've developed and you're very supportive of educational programs in the elementary schools and the high schools around the labs. One of the problems, at least for the people I represent, they're a little further down from the labs and sometimes it's difficult for them to take advantage of the programs that you have initiated and implemented.
And I just would like to hear from you what future plans you have to extend those type of programs so that students, at least close enough to the labs, can get there -- not nearby but, say, the students from Arizona might be able to get to the New Mexico labs, as an example.
SEC. PENA: Congressman, thank you for that question. And let me address this to all the members because I think this will be of interest. We have proposed a relatively modest, $15 million addition to our education initiative, and let me tell you how we're going to use these dollars. We would like to have our scientists and technicians in our laboratories develop math and science tutorials for kindergarten through 12th grade and put them on the Internet so that they'll be available to any child and any science or math teacher anywhere in the country as more and more classrooms are now being connected to the Internet. And we're seeing that happen all over the country.
And we think that given the extraordinary technologies and resources we have in the department, we have, again for a relatively modest amount of investment here, an opportunity to make a huge difference. You all recently heard of Secretary Riley's report on how our 12th graders are performing in science and math. We are almost at the bottom of the list in terms of our competitors worldwide. And while we are not a department of education, we think there is a very helpful role we can play in providing these kinds of assistances to teachers and students around the country, so that all you have to do is be connected to the Internet.
Secondly, we are expanding our work and encouraging students to come into our labs from throughout the country, and science and math teachers themselves, who can come in, get additional training, develop their own home page for their own school. But the whole idea is for us to share our resources not only in the geographic proximity where our labs are located, but throughout the country so we can have hopefully a much better impact on how our children are performing in science and math.
I think this department has an extraordinary opportunity here to make a big difference for future generations, and our country, I believe, cannot fall behind in science and math as we produce the next generation of scientists and engineers that are going to be sorely needed if we're going to be competitive in the world. So I hope the members will look at that proposal. I think it has great promise. And again, I think we can have an enormous impact for kids around the country.
REP. PASTOR: Mr. Chairman, I'll submit the other questions for the record. Thank you very much.
REP. MCDADE: We thank you. I'm pleased to recognize now the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. Frelinghuysen.
REP. RODNEY FRELINGHUYSEN (R-NJ): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, Mr. Secretary. I'm an inveterate newspaper article clipper. My office is full of old clippings, yellow, some new. And I also when I attend my town meetings, I have looking over my shoulders alumni from Bell Labs, Lucent, what's left of Bell Corps, AT&T, pharmaceutical companies that make up a good portion of northern New Jersey. And many of them get on my case relative to the nuclear stockpile stewardship issue as to the vast amounts of money we spend on this program.
And I did get some reassurance when I visited through your good offices a couple of your laboratories earlier this year. But somewhat piggy-backing on Mr. Fazio's earlier questions, Mr. Rogers' as well, I'd like your reaction to some of the comments that appeared in a 'New York Times' editorial in late November, where they described spending for the program, and I quote:
'While some spending is required, the program devised by the Clinton administration and Congress is extravagant.' The editorial goes on to say, 'Some effort to maintain necessary skills is appropriate. So, too, are computer simulations and mechanical sampling to learn more about what happens to bomb trigger mechanisms or plutonium decays. Adequate supplies of tritium must be assured in case decaying warheads need to be replaced. But the stewardship program does not subsidize unrelated experimentation or allow any effort to design and build more advanced weapons.'
Then it goes on to say, in conclusion, 'The Congressional Budget Office has proposed less expensive ways to assure weapons reliability.'
One approach would be to consolidate the work at one of the existing labs and do without the NIF, the ignition facility. Another would rely on commercial reactors to produce tritium instead of calling for a new government plant. When you read, and 'The New York Times' is one of many papers, these types of editorial comments and then a couple of weeks later, Stephen A. Schwartz (sp) writes, and he's -- his comment here, he's a writer, he's the director of the U.S. Nuclear Weapons Cost Study Program, Brookings Institution. Obviously, Brookings may have a certain agenda.
And he writes, 'Your editorial of November 30, criticizing the administration's nuclear weapons stockpile stewardship and management program as extravagant is on the mark. From 1948 to 1991, the Department of Energy and its predecessors spent nearly $150 billion to research, develop and build and maintain more than 70,000 nuclear warheads, et cetera, et cetera.
An additional 160 billion (dollars) was expended producing the nuclear materials to fuel these weapons.' And he goes on to say, 'Now with production halted, the arsenal shrinking and nuclear tests likely to be banned forever, the administration proposes to spend at least $45 billion over the next decade maintaining the arsenal, 800 million (dollars) more per year than what was spent on average during the Cold War.'
When you read these types of comments as a member of Congress, and public perception is everything, even though I want to be a believer, how do you tell me that we are not in fact, for instance, doing some unrelated experimentation that is not necessarily -- are we doing unrelated experimentation that might not conceivably be considered to be under the certification process?
SEC. PENA: The direct answer, Congressman, is no. Let me try to respond to the editorial, which I also read, and some of the other concerns that have been raised by others. Number one, we would be happy to provide you a side-by-side analysis of the cost to the government of our old program when we had nuclear testing compared to the costs that are envisioned in the stockpile stewardship program. We would very respectfully argue that the costs that we are using for this program are less than the costs of the old program.
I am not including, by the way, in that analysis the cost of cleanup that was part of the work we did in the so-called old days referenced to the gentleman who wrote that article. If you want to include those costs, then we've got, obviously, no comparison.
Secondly, there are some statements made in the editorial which are, in effect, incorrect about the purpose of stockpile stewardship program. Perhaps I need to spend some more time with that newspaper to clarify our program. REP. FRELINGHUYSEN: Would you specifically comment on the subsidization of unrelated experimentation issue?
SEC. PENA: I don't know what that's in reference to. We are not subsidizing unrelated work. The National Ignition Facility is --
REP. FRELINGHUYSEN: Well, I must say, I was excited by what I saw in California.
SEC. PENA: Absolutely.
REP. FRELINGHUYSEN: And obviously, I know you've got the brightest and best in the nation working on some very basic research that perhaps could not be done anywhere else, you know, certainly in a private facility. But is it all tied in to the nuclear stockpile safeguard issue?
SEC. PENA: Yes, it is. And we can go through each of those technologies, whether it's the NIF or any others or our supercomputer program, and explain very clearly why they're essential to our stockpile stewardship program. The NIF, for example, is necessary to test the heat and the pressure of a nuclear weapon explosion without actually having a detonation. We're conducting our subcritical experiments, which don't reach criticality because we still need that kind of information. We have to continue to produce at least some number of pits in Los Alamos. We have to produce tritium because of the fact that tritium is decaying, about 12-1/2 percent, I think, in a cycle. So we can --
REP. FRELINGHUYSEN: Relative to that, do we need a new government plant? And why can't we use -- rely on commercial reactors?
SEC. PENA: Congressman, as you know, my responsibility this year is to make a decision on the tritium options that we have before us. And we will be making that decision. There are two options that we are pursuing. There was a third option or a parallel option that was put in place by Secretary O'Leary, which was to keep the (Fast flush?) test reactor on standby condition. And so we're looking at all those options, but we're going to make a decision about that this year and come to closure on what process we're going to use for tritium production.
REP. FRELINGHUYSEN: Well, the overall proposals from the CBO, have you responded specifically to the CBO's findings? And have you in fact embraced any of their recommendations?
SEC. PENA: Congressman, let me ask our defense program team if they have had an opportunity to respond to the CBO. I'm going to assume they have, but I'm not certain they have.
REP. FRELINGHUYSEN: I think it's a fairly basic -- SEC. PENA: Let me find out if they have.
REP. FRELINGHUYSEN: -- question. Some could say, maybe, they don't have the scientific base or knowledge or responsibility you have, so they may not know what they're talking about. But certainly from our perspective, it would be good --
SEC. PENA: Let me check to make sure we have responded to that.
REP. FRELINGHUYSEN: Well, could you comment on the idea of consolidating the work at one of the existing labs? A lot of this work -- the consolidation issue. I know each one of these in and of itself is a remarkable facility. I mean, the brain power there, the experimentation, the cross-pollination, I assume, which is, you know, worldwide in facilities, between facilities. But from a lay person's view, it does seem to me that we have the potential there for a tremendous amount of duplication.
SEC. PENA: Congressman, I agree that those are questions that are very legitimately asked. I am very happy to give you much more detail, but let me give you a general answer today.
Number one, the three laboratories we are discussing do in fact have different and distinct missions. However, when it comes to the Stockpile Stewardship Program, one of the byproducts that we get from having the different labs, is our ability to cross check using completely different approaches to Stockpile Stewardship to make sure that in fact the analysis being done by one group of scientists is verified by a second group of scientists.
That has been for better or worse the approach that our country has used in much of the defense work that goes back many decades to ensure that we have this kind of verification on such sensitive issues, like nuclear security. And I don't think we want to abandon that kind of an approach, because it has worked very well in the past and I think we ought to continue to have it.
But again, there are distinct missions that are undertaken by those labs. It is my view that they are necessary and we think the work they are doing is fully justifiable, but I'd be happy to give you a much fuller answer describing very specifically the work that they do and why there is not duplication.
REP. FRELINGHUYSEN: At the Chairman's suggestion and certainly if you serve on the committee you have some responsibility to visit DOE facilities and I have a lot more to visit. And as excited as many of the men and women were who showed me what they were working on, it did seem to me, since I do get around, that some of these projects seem to be similar to what are going on in other research facilities around the country. It's almost like we have a little piece of everything in terms of the human GENOM (ph) project. I mean, there are plenty of these types of efforts, which appear to be going on in major universities around the country. I just think the potential here -- and I would specifically like you to address the unrelated experimentation issue. Everybody showed me their piece, you know, advanced cancer research. With all due respect, humankind may benefit from a lot of this work, but it does seem that the rug that the annual certification that you annually certify appears to be quite a large rug to put things under. Maybe that's a wrong analogy, but it's a huge umbrella here and I think the New York Times has raised some legitimate issues and members of Congress need to raise these issues. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
REP. MCDADE: The chair recognizes the gentleman from Indiana, Mr. Visclosky.
REP. PETER J. VISCLOSKY (D-IN): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary welcome.
Mr. Secretary, looking now to fiscal year '03, there's a significant increase in the Stewardship funding for stockpile stewardship. There's not a corresponding increase in the Stockpile management funding. Would you want to comment on that? I must tell you just a concern that we're not investing enough in our plant infrastructure as far as the management program.
SEC. PENA: Congressman, I don't have --
(cross-talk.)
REP. VISCLOSKY: -- the exact figures are unimportant. I guess my generic question would be, or comment is I'm concerned that this year, next and the out years were not maintaining the physical plant facilities that we have in our ability to use the new technologies and the Stewardship Program.
SEC. PENA: Then Congressman, as I visited our labs, I observed that we're going to have some challenges in the future in a number of areas, basic infrastructure for example, plant maintenance. Again, those are out year numbers. We, of course, do an annual budget which I think responds to the immediate needs that we have, but let me give you a more specific answer about the difference for the 2003 number for Stewardship as opposed to management. It may have to do with some of the technologies that are coming on board in those out years, but I don't have the information in front of me at the moment.
REP. VISCLOSKY: And Secretary, I'm not again so much interested in the ratio, or in this case the justification for the Stewardship Program.
It just obviously caught my eye and we certainly had comments and complaints raised that we're running dangerously close as far as our under investment, as far as the plans, the equipment, the wiring, computerization, to implement, if you would, this Stewardship Program, as far those weapon's plants. So, I'm more interested in the concern looking out, if we're close, if those are out year numbers, why are they out year numbers and they're not number now, that would be the response I've been looking for.
SEC. PENA: I will get you a more fuller answer.
REP. VISCLOSKY: Thank you very much.
The next question I have, also looking at the plans themselves, is it's my understanding about the year '05, 90 percent of the skilled trades workforce at the Kansas City plan for example will have been hiring between 1977 and 1981. And again, concern about a bulge as far as retirement of the personnel at those plants.
I assume, and again in varying degrees, that maybe fairly typical of some of the other plants. I may be incorrect in my assumption. What concerns do you have, the Department have, and what actions are the Department looking at?
SEC. PENA: Congressman, we have the same concerns. We had a prior conversation about the fact that we're losing some of our scientists and engineers in that time frame, but we're losing lots of other highly technical people in that time frame. So we are very focused on two things. One is making sure we have the technologies, which would allow us to bring on this new leadership of scientists and engineers who are coming out of our universities.
Defense programs, for example, now has a very specific program focused on key universities to make sure that we are generating the right kind of graduate and post graduate students who will have those technologies. So, we are trying to link two key universities now to make sure we have that stream --
REP. VISCLOSKY: That includes Notre Dame, I assume.
(Laughter.)

REP. VISCLOSKY: Mr. Chairman, one would assume so.
(Laughter.)
SEC. PENA: But it applies to other skill mixes that we have in the department and so we are focused on that and trying to anticipate those shortages and try to determine how they're going to recruit the next wave of technical people to fill those slots. That is going to be a challenge. We're looking at various options right now about the kinds of incentives or changes in our personnel procedures to allow us to have some flexibility to do that. But it's going to be very targeted and it's going to have to be done in a way that will allow us keep people that we need to keep and yet bring in these new skills that are needed in that time frame. So, we agree with your concern and we will be focused on it.
REP. VISCLOSKY: Final question, Mr. Chairman.
My understanding is DOD is making or planning a number of changes as far as existing warheads. My understanding is that DOD has expressed some concern about the possible safety and reliability the warheads have given these changes.
How are the two departments matching up on that controversy?
SEC. PENA: If I understand your question correctly Congressman, we work in tandem to insure that from the Stockpile Stewardship perspective and for the annual certification, that we agree that the work we're doing in verifying the weapons is of the same degree of confidence, and we have that today.
If the question is, what levels of weapons we are using, either under Start one or Start two, there is still a difference both departments about what we are using. DOD has asked us to use Start one numbers for the work that we're doing, but I believe in some areas, they may be using Start two numbers and that's a function of how quickly we get to Start 3. But if your question is geared at some issues that we have discovered in certain weapons in our particular surveillance and investigation, my view is that we have addressed all of those to the satisfaction of DOD. And that is why this year, Secretary Cohen and I were both able to certify the safety and security, and reliability of our weapons.
I don't know if that was the question you were asking, but I'm trying to hit at least three different parts of the concerns that may be out there.
REP. VISCLOSKY: Secretary, thank you very much. Mr. Chairman.
REP. MCDADE: Mr. Secretary, let me ask you this question. We've had a good relationship built between you and the department and this committee, and it may come to the time, as we go downstream, that we're going to hit some financial glitches. We usually do. Your department has about a billion one, I think it is or a bit more increase in this fiscal year.
Can you prioritize either the growth of the billion one, or the baseline as to where you might be putting your priorities or in effect to the committee volunteering lower priority programs? I know that's a hard question for you, but we may come to that. We probably will. We usually do and I want to ask you up front.
SEC. PENA: Mr. Chairman, I have not done that analysis. Obviously, let me take your question under advisement and see how we think about that.
REP. MCDADE: We will be in contact with you and we'd love you to take a look at it. One of the issues, that circulates around is the external regulation of DOE facility. And, as you know, this has been an ongoing question for a long period of time. There's been some pilot projects as we understand it that have demonstrated the kind of regulation that could be applied externally, works very well. The pilot plan has moved along efficiently. There was a lot of money saved and the external regulation appears to be, by a large consensus, the way to go. What is your position on that please?
SEC. PENA: Mr. Chairman, we support the notion of external regulation. We have embarked on three pilot projects with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. They are not completed, however, we have just started them and they will probably go on for at least a year, almost perhaps two years before we finally have the results of those pilot programs.
But thus far, they are on track and we try to find very discrete aspects of DOE work that were most amenable to NRC supervision and regulation here. So we'll continue to work on this and obviously, the more confidence we see that this work can continue, we can then begin to work in more complicated areas. But I want to avoid, if I might, the mistake that I think this department has made in past years and that is to bite off more than we can chew too early and then find out we have made a serious misjudgment.
REP. MCDADE: Yeah, and we don't, of course, want you to do anything like that. But on the other hand, there seem to be areas within the department that wouldn't have to wait for a year or two to make decisions about whether or not they ought to be externally regulated. Some of them are less complicated, and it seems to us. And my question to you is, can you segment the complicated from the ones that might be easier solved per external regulation purposes.
SEC. PENA: I think we can Mr. Chairman, and we'd be happy to look at whatever suggestions you might have of other areas that we might be looking at. We'd be happy to look at that.
REP. MCDADE: Take a good look at it. Because it appears that in terms of efficiency, in terms of savings, that there can be a significant amount of money on the table and a great deal more efficiency in terms of accomplishing the nation's objectives.
One of the things that everybody's looked about and talked about here greatly today is the operation of the laboratories. And as you know, the board issued a series of findings and they were quite critical of headquarters operations and it's contract structure. Now you talked about that a bit in your opening remarks and I was delighted to hear you addressing that. It's a serious problem. Will you articulate a little bit more for us about how you intend to cope with those problems? First, do you agree with the finding of the Board?
SEC. PENA: Yes we do, in the sense that we have a problem with Number one, communication, lines of responsibility between headquarters afield and some of our other facilities. Yes, we have to do a better job in that area.
REP. MCDADE: What can the committee look forward to seeing you do to implement the recommendations to the Board?
SEC. PENA: Well, we've already started to take several actions. First of all, we have put together a Research and Development Council, which is chaired by the Under Secretary. That, we believe, will be able to make sure that across the department our R & D work is more focused and that we do not duplicate the work that we're doing.
Secondly, we have reconstituted the Secretaries of Board, which reviews all major projects. As I said earlier, that had been discontinued in years past. We now have that working again to look at major projects to make sure that we're using the best expertise in the Department. And so there are other crosscutting areas where we are, I believe, doing a better job of making sure we're synchronizing the work across the complex so that we have better communication.
There is more work that yet needs to be done. And there are other recommendations in the report that we're still reviewing.
REP. MCDADE: Well, we look forward to that. The committee was furnished with a management chart of the Pantex Plant which is so important. And I don't know if you had a chance to see it yet, but we would recommend it to you just to kind of look at the way there is need for improvement in the management, in the contracts, as we have an opportunity to speak today.
Let's talk a bit about the nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain. We know that the Administration continues to, as a policy, oppose interim storage.
What proposals is the Department going to make about how to solve that problem? Do you have anything in mind, Mr. Secretary?
SEC. PENA: Mr. Chairman, our position, I think, has been very clear. We believe that the solution to taking these wastes is the long-term geologic disposal facility that we are working. Last year we completed the five-mile tunnel, this year we will complete what we're calling a cross-drift which is another segment of the tunnel to give us more information.
We are now heating the mountain in ways that no other country is doing anywhere else, to test the moisture and the capacity of the mountain. At the end of this year we will complete the viability assessment and next year we will begin the preliminary environmental impact work for a record of vision, I believe, in 2,001 and then get to a suitability determination about the mountain. That is the work program that we have in place.
As respects the immediate problem, which is the fact that the Department has not been able to take waste physically as of January of this year. As you know, there is litigation about that. I, right after I became Secretary of Energy, sat down with representatives of the plaintiffs in that matter and offered a number of different options. Number one, I talked about the possibility of the Department taking legal title to the fuel. Number two, I talked about our interest and perhaps paying some kind of damage or compensation for costs that are being incurred by the utilities while they are still paying into the fund and yet maintaining the material on their own sites.
And there were other suggestions that we made at that time. I must tell you, Mr. Chairman, there was no interest in those options. And the parties that I met with simply explained to me that the only solution that they had in mind was the passage of the legislation pending before the Congress. You know, the Administration's position, which is long standing, and long before I became Secretary of Energy, and that has not changed. So we'll continue to work on the Yucca Mountain project, we want to continue to make sure we're using the best science and engineering analysis we have, on the other hand I am still pleased to sit down and have additional conversations with the plaintiffs in the litigation.

REP. MCDADE: We are gratified by that comment, Mr. Secretary. We know it's a hard problem and they're kind of an intractable positions on the people who are contesting, but we hope you can work something through, and we encourage you to continue.
There was a new act called the Debt Collection Improvement Act, you can answer this for the record, Mr. Secretary, expediting methods by which departments can get back the debt that arose. The Department apparently has a debt of 2.3 billion outstanding.
Will you indicate to us please what steps you're going to take to remedy that situation? Also the IG report that was issued about final deliverables from grants indicated that there were a lot of final reports, technical or financial, that were not, in fact, presented to the Department as a final product. I don't understand why that wouldn't occur. Do you understand me? Have you had a chance to look at that, Mr. Secretary?
SEC. PENA: I am not familiar with that particular report, Mr. Chairman. The concern is that deliverables conducted by contractors don't come --
REP. MCDADE: Yeah. The final report doesn't show up whether it's technical, final report on cost are not showing up. This is your IG--
SEC. PENA: Let me look into that again, Mr. Chairman.
REP. MCDADE: We would appreciate if you would. There is an issue, that may well be the most significant issue, energy issue, affecting the country in the next 20 years, deregulation of utility industry, electric and utility industry in the country. We haven't really heard anything about the Department's position with respect to that or whether you've had an opportunity to look deeply at it or whether we're going to get recommendations, or what kind of leadership the Department is going to provide the citizens of the country as this enormously important decision is reached. What, if any, is the position of the Department on deregulation, etceteras, and what do you recommend.
SEC. PENA: Mr. Chairman, the Department has been the lead in the Administration on this issue and we have basically completed a year and one-half analysis of the various approaches we would take as respect to restructuring the industry. We have in, the way the Administration normally presents its formal position to the Congress, have engaged in an inter-agency discussion about this.
We are very close to reaching final conclusions about this as an administration. Obviously this is being coordinated by the White House and we hope to be able to make that public as soon as possible. But prior to that time, we have discussed in a general way, principles that we believe ought to be a part of any restructuring package. But we want to be engaged with the Congress, there is work both in the House and in the Senate. We think that it is helpful for us to be engaged and we very much want to be at the table to be part of that discussion.
REP. MCDADE: A lot of the states are moving right out smartly on it now as we speak, so we will be grateful to hear from you.
There was an issue that came up involving a Department of Energy pre-college program management fund, which was reported by the General Accounting Office to be inefficiently managed. The Department didn't request any money, the Congress didn't provide any money. We were informed, nevertheless, that activities which had been previously carried out, were still being carried out, no request in your budget, no appropriation from this committee.
I wrote a letter down to the Department addressed to you, but down to the people that run the Department, asking what authority was being used, since there had not been an appropriation. And since there had not been a budget request to continue these activities and the letter back said, well we're using the authority of prior Congresses. That's a letter I'd like you to look at again, as far as the committee is concerned, that's a declaration of war.
(Laughter.)
SEC. PENA: I don't want that, Mr. Chairman.
(Laughter.)
REP. MCDADE: Article I is pretty specific about who does what, and so take a good hard look at it and as soon as you can, get a paper back up to the committee so that we can see what occurred there.
SEC. PENA: I'll be happy to.
REP. MCDADE: I now recognize the gentleman from California.
REP. FAZIO: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Don't worry, Mr. Secretary, it's just conventional war.
(Laughter.)
We do this every year.
(Laughter.)
I wanted to ask a question about the next generation Internet, this is the second year in which the Administration has requested funding in this bill, and I think there are six agencies that total 110 million this year, twenty-five in your budget. There's no question on this, on the part of any of us, that the Internet has grown tremendously since 1968, 400 percent a year. But as you said earlier, responding to some other questioner, you know you have the biggest computers and probably the most technical competence of any of the agencies in the federal government for this.
I guess I'm concerned, as are others, that the large number of agencies, as well as university and laboratory beneficiaries, make this program a little bit unwieldy. And I'm wondering about how we're going to perform as an interagency effort and what sort of interaction we're going to have with the national scientific community, you know, there were clearly many other beneficiaries in the original Internet development. Universities, labs, have we got them all factored in, are they all participating? They're clearly all going to benefit.
SEC. PENA: Congressman, you're right. First of all, this is an Administration-wide priority and so different departments are taking different parts of this next generation Internet. As respects the Department of Energy, our immediate need is for own scientists in our own laboratories.
When you visit our labs you will see, and when you talk to our scientists, their need for having this new generation of Internet communications so, that they can do their work simultaneously, and particularly with the new challenges we're going to be facing in the subject we talked about earlier, and that is the stockpile storageship program. So for our own scientific work, for our own in house capabilities, particularly in the next decade, we need the next generation Internet for the DOE.
But we're going to make sure that as we develop this, with your support, that and with the Department's interaction with universities and the private sector, we find a way to make sure that this is done in a way that will have broader use. But we need it immediately for our own use in the Department of Energy.
REP. FAZIO: Well I think there's an assumption on the part of some of us, that given all the investment we're making in computers, there ought to be a way to make sure that we, perhaps, make a contribution to the next generation Internet without necessarily additional funding. There may well be ways to make savings and find opportunities for synthesis between the efforts that we're going to be making to build up your computer capacity and at the same time expand the usage of the Internet.
SEC. PENA: Well, Congressman let me do this. Let me give you a more specific explanation about why we need additional funds as opposed to the monies we're now using for our super computers. That in and of itself is a big enough challenge just to do that and that is make our commitment for the next super computer power we're going to need, but the next generation Internet effort is in effect a distinct program.
And we believe we need additional funding, but let me give you some more information about that.
REP. FAZIO: Let me just conclude by saying I think we need to hear also from the private sector, the value of the NGI. We've seen a lot support from the various agencies involved, but I think Congress needs to get a better picture of the advantages of moving on this. And we need to hear from people who have used the Internet as a method of expanding commerce as well as, you know, the benefits that have accrued to the private sector.
One last question as relates to nuclear non-proliferation. You have in the material protection control in the accounting program an increase for $15 million in additional funds. Given the problems we face around the world with issues of nuclear materials being lost and perhaps falling into the hands of terrorists, I wonder if you could describe the benefits of this program and indicate why you think this increase is important.
SEC. PENA: Congressman Fazio, I think that if one looks at this program, which I believe is only four years old, which essentially was started from scratch, and when one recognizes that today we are in 53 different sites in the former Soviet Union entities, it has been a remarkably successful program. And the fact that we're asking for more money indicates that we want to expand that in terms of more work at those sites.
When I visit the Kachotov (ph) Institute, for example, in Moscow, outside of Moscow, and I saw pictures of the old facility and I went in and saw the new facility. And I saw not only defenses but cameras, the computerized system that now accounts for the materials whereas they used to do it by hand, the new vault -- (off mike) -- exactly. The new tax systems that are needed to get any facilities; I am reminded of just how important this work is.
And given the enormous volumes of material throughout those countries and now that many of these cities are now open, which had previously been closed, we've got to make sure that we're doing our very best to work with them to secure those materials. So it is a high national security priority. I think we are on track and the amount of money we're requesting will allow us to do an even better job. REP. FAZIO: Are we getting the kind of cooperation from the Russian government that makes it possible for us to spend this money successfully?
SEC. PENA: Yes we are, Congressman. In fact, the Russians are here this week and we are in our tenth Gore-Chernomyrdin and this is one of the issues that we talked about. There are bureaucratic administrative issues that come up every once in a while but we are trying to resolve those. But by and large this program has been enormously successful. In fact, we have now expanded it to include the Russian navy and in my meetings with the Russian navy they have indicated their, at first, concern about our being involved with the Navy and now that they see we can do this in way than just jeopardize any classified information. are strong believers in it and want us to be even more involved with their materials.
REP. FAZIO: So the submarine ballistic missile launching platforms in the Soviet Navy are now going to be looked at as well. The materials they have maintained separately and apart from land base nuclear weapons.
SEC. PENA: These are materials that their Navy has which they either have in preparation for use, which needs attention.
REP. FAZIO: We hear a good deal about the degree to which the Soviet informer so the Russian Navy continues to be a nuclear threat. You're telling us that we're beginning to turn the corner on that element of Russian weaponry as well.
SEC. PENA: I think Congressman, the work that our two governments have done in trying to defuse the nuclear tensions has been extraordinary. We continue to make very good progress there. We are hopeful that DUMA, will ratify Star 2 very soon so we can get on with negotiations and Star 3. But in the mean time the work that we've done in Russia, particular in making sure that materials are safeguarded is war that is very important to our national security.
REP. FAZIO: I guess the real problem is the DUMA and not President Yeltsin and his administration. But --
SEC. PENA: Well we're still hopeful the DUMA will move over.
REP. FAZIO: We all are. And we thank you very much for your testimony today. We appreciate your being here.
REP. MCDADE: The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas, Mr. Dickey.
REP. JAY DICKEY (R-AR): Thank you Mr. Chairman, hello Mr. Secretary.
SEC. PENA: Hi. REP. DICKEY: How are you doing?
SEC. PENA: Fine.
REP. DICKEY: Two lines of questions, one continuing on the Russian idea. Russia I guess about a year and a half ago, maybe a year ago sold three nuclear submarines to China as I recall. We are spending a lot of money trying to help them and I think to some degree they're standing aside and said if you're going to spend money to help us in our nonproliferation efforts. We'll just let you keep spending the money. Do we have any leverage when Russia sales arms to North Korea or Iraq or Iran or China, do we have any leverage to get some of that money applied to their responsibility in doing what we're doing in Russia?
SEC. PENA: Congressman, we -- the answer is yes. What we attempt to do is to have a understanding from the Russian government about the resources that they're applying in this work, so that we know how our resources are leveraging, if I can use that work the resources of the Russian government? Congressman, I think it is well known that the Russian government and the Russian people have their own economic challenges that they're dealing with.
They're working very hard on those issues and I believe that the relationship that we've established at least in the MPCA program and other programs has worked well in order for us to make sure that we work these issues together. And that we maximize our limited resources from both sides.
REP. DICKEY: Good. Back -- as far as the domestic matter now, I think it's called State University of New York at Buffalo has just retrofitted its -- I was reading it's just retrofitted its energy system delivering heat and air-conditioning. And they're saving either 6 or 9 million dollars a year. Are you familiar with that?
SEC. PENA: Not with that particular retrofit, Congressman.
REP. DICKEY: Well what are we doing, now I've got five, at least five Universities in my District. It seems like that is a thirdly feel, what are we doing to encourage institutions like that, to retrofit and to save that amount of money?
SEC. PENA: We have issued what are called, they're energy audits. And we did these competitively and companies will come in and win these bids, which then gives them the purgative of working with federal departments. And we are doing this on behalf of the entire government so that for example we issued a competitive bid for the western part of the United States, which allows any federal facility from any department to participate.
And what it permits, is for a company to come in, in to one of our facilities and say we will install at our own cost, the new technologies, energy efficient technologies in your building, and we predict we'll save you 30 percent of your energy bill, they do that. And if they make that mark, they then get compensated from the savings, the department they achieve from those efficiencies.
We're now doing that throughout the government in different departments, it is working very well. When I recently addressed state legislators and recently Mayors and others, I asked that they work with us to see if they can in effect piggyback on the contracts that we now have out, so that they perhaps can also capitalize on this work. So that they don't have to go out and do their own contract solicitations themselves. There may be some technical and procedural issues we have to work out, but I think there is way for state institutions to utilize our federal contracts for their benefits.
We have now done our second contract for the south, later on this year I believe we'll do the northeast and complete the entire country I think in about a year. In that since, have all of the federal facilities in the United States covered. So we'll continue to work with universities and state institutions and others to see if there's a way that they can participate in these contracts.
REP. DICKEY: Good, I have only one other question that I don't think I could even read, it's so complicated that I'd like to provide for the records --
(Laughter.)
-- but I also want to say that I think you've done an excellent job in your testimony from the time I've been here and you seem to be doing an excellent job in your position Secretary Pena.
SEC. PENA: Thank you.
REP. DICKEY: Thank you Mr. Chairman.
REP. MCDADE: The gentleman from Texas is recognized.
REP. EDWARDS: Thank you Mr. Chairman, Secretary Pena, thank you for your excellent testimony today. Let me ask you briefly and it probably would be appropriate to respond in greater detail and writing. But recognizing the time in just a few minutes, could you briefly summarize what we're doing in terms of the Caspian Sea Reserves? Recognizing that the recent actions by Saddam Hussein remind us how incredibly over dependent we are, upon oil from a very unstable part of the world.
I know you've taken leadership role in this area but perhaps you could briefly update us on what you and the department have done for the last twelve months regarding the Caspian Sea.
SEC. PENA: I'd be happy to Congressman, and it is a very important issues and I'm glad that the media in particular has focused more on the whole Caspian area. We begin first with a part of our national energy security strategy which calls for diversifying world oil supplies so that speaking for the United States we are not overly dependent on one particular part of the world. We have made some progress sir, for example, Venezuela is now our largest importer of oil. I think Mexico is second, I think Saudi Arabia is third. That's very different than it was several years ago.
But the Caspian Sea area is we think the next most important part of the world for diversifying oil supplies. I recently took a Presidential mission to the Caspian, where I met with the Presidents of five other key countries in the Caspian area. And we have reached a general agreement that we should explore a concept called multiple pipelines, which means that oil, which comes out of the Caspian Sea should not have only one route.
Today, the early oil coming out of for example, Azerbaijan goes primarily north to Russia. But in the fall of this year the consortium will make decisions about other pipelined routes. For two reasons one, our own national security and two for world stability. We think it would be very helpful to have what is called an east west series of pipelines, taking oil across the Caspian to Boco (ph) and Azerbaijan north perhaps to a place called Soupsa (ph) and then down through Turkey.
The reason we believe that is important from a national security prospective is because we fundamentally disagree with the actions being taken in Iran, where Iran is attempting to become a dominant player in that part of the world as respects energy. We disagree with that for many reasons. But secondly, we think that for the economic stability of the countries in the Caspian, energy is going to be the life-blood for their economic security and stability in the future.
And we believe that by having multiple pipelines that go east and west there will be more benefit to more countries in the region again, making that oil available for world supplies. So that is a brief summary of our strategy we're working very hard on this. We're making some progress, there are still some issues to be resolve but I think that we now have at least a very firm and specific policy in the Caspian region.
REP. EDWARDS: I'd be glad to yield, gentleman we need a --
REP. VISCLOSKY: Were the Iranians included in those discussions?
SEC. PENA: Yes, I visited with the then President who is as you know no longer the President of Armenia but I did visit with him --
REP. VISCLOSKY: They are included in those discussions.
SEC. PENA: Yes.
REP. VISCLOSKY: Okay. Thank you.
REP. EDWARDS: Thank you and perhaps in your written answers without putting you in the uncomfortable position of asking you to lobby when we're telling you not to. If you could just perhaps lest, to what are the areas of policy that this Congress and the next Congress and the next Congress must deal with whichever direction we go to facilitate the development of the Caspian Sea, energy reserves?
SEC. PENA: I'd be happy to do that Congressman.
REP. EDWARDS: Thank you Mr. Secretary. Mr. Chairman, thank you.
REP. MCDADE: The gentleman from Michigan is recognized.
REP. KNOLLENBERG: Chairman, thank you very much and Mr. Secretary we're getting down I think closer to the end here. I had, this is a very quick question first of all and it may have been brought up but I didn't here it. What's the status of the DOE being online to handle a computer problem in the year 2000? Is that a quick answer or?
SEC. PENA: But we're very focused on this Congressman, I have a team of people who are determined to make sure that we comply. The president raised this himself in a recent cabinet meeting so we are determined to meet our goals. We have I think 270 what are considered critical mission items. We are making our target in insuring that we resolve the Y2000 problem. But this is, we have to do it, it's not a priority, we have to do it. There's just no question about it.
REP. KNOLLENBERG: And we're going to here it again--
SEC. PENA: Absolutely. I also want to discuss and one of the problems I have with Rocky Flats in particular and coming back to that subject you may think I'm a broken record. But let me tell you why I'm a little confused about the in game or the closure date and some of the numbers that are in the budget that we discussed the last around. Just last Thursday my office received from the Department of Energy the, it's a notebook entitled the Function Cost Data Report for 1994 through '97 for each of those four years. And in this report there's a variety of charts and I'm sure your staff has those perhaps with them.
I have a couple of three copies here but in the reports, in these various charts the EM sights, this is just for the EM sight. Under each site there's a chart that demonstrates the tend of cost over the last four years. And these charts are broken down into three categories, one, is the mission direct costs, which is, that's the cleanup guys. And then there's the mission support costs and then there's the general support costs. Now the mission direct is indicated by a red line, you can't see that from here and I'm more than willing to share these with you. But for example the-- and also I should say that the admission support costs are a yellow line.
REP. KNOLLENBERG: Um-hmm.
SEC. PENA: And finally general support cost goes to blue line. Now in the cleanup operations where we're trying to bring to closure like in Rocky, it would seem to me that the mission direct folks should be top heavy because you're trying to bring it together. To give an example and I do have some charts here, Rocky Flats, if you look at this and I know you, perhaps you cannot see it. But the yellow line is at the top and that we think you should be the least top heavy, it should be down here some place. The red line is where the real cleanup activity should be taking place.
Now if I'm wrong in that assumption, tell me? But that's what I've always been led to believe. The blue line then of course is the general support. To give you an example for now, which is in a closure status, I think you can see that's pretty clear. The red line way up on top and your other activity, your other dollar amounts for cleanup or for other activities is way down. And that's what I would think it should be. We should be moving toward Rocky.
Savannah is somewhat the same way. It's kind of top heavy with some of the mission support people, but the real mission direct activity as you can see is this red line. What's disturbing about Rocky Flats is that the mission direct moved below the other two in 1997. They're kind of flat, so to speak, but it still moved below. I'm wondering if maybe were not getting the kind of support that we need more heavily in the mission direct category. And that would bring about, I think the more of a feeling from us if these charts are to be believed, that we're moving closer to a end game in sight here.
I just wanted to get your thoughts about that as to why the apparent inconsistency about the support costs that seem to be moving away from mission direct particularly at Rocky.

Congressman, let me get to the bottom of that and get you a very specific answer about those lines. Obviously the reason we're trying to close Rocky as quickly as possible is because some of these indirect costs are so high. Because they're so high and they shouldn't be there for the benefit of the entire complex we want to close it as quickly as possible. Let me get back to you with a comparison between the other two sites you indicated and try to detail why it is those lines are where they are.
REP. KNOLLENBERG: And I would remind you and I'm sure you know that there's one for every single site. So there seems to be a consistency about a lot of them, most of them in fact, but this one bothers me a little bit, because now I'm seeing focus on an activity that should be secondary in purpose. And so we would appreciate some details on that. And I look forward to that.
Finally, I just want to say thank you again for coming before us. Everything that we're trying to do, I hope you realize is a mutual thing, it's something that you want, it's something that we want and we've talked about that. So we'll continue to work with you. Thank you, appreciate it.
REP. MCDADE: Mr. Secretary, let me conclude on the issue that my friend from Michigan raised about the computer conversion. Can you tell us how many computers have been converted? And how many remain to be converted within the Department of Energy?
SEN. PENA: I can't give you the exact numbers today. I know that we had approximately at last count, I believe this is correct 270, what are called mission critical functions. And we have a specific schedule for making sure that those issues are addressed before obviously the year 2000.
And the other point about this, the reason this is urgent is the because the budget we have before you is in effect the last budget that will allow us where we have to buy computers to go out and get them now so we can install them in the early part of next year and have them ready. OMB has given us a target of I think March of next year or April of next year so we're not waiting until we get to 2000. We're trying to anticipate that and hit it before that deadline.
REP. MCDADE: When you talk about mission critical computers, are they all on the defense side or would you be more specific about what you mean?
SEN. PENA: This is a general definition that OMB has used with all the departments that basically make the point these clearly must be addressed before the year 2000, because they have a critical function in the department. Some of them are defense obviously, but there are others that are not defense related across the spectrum.
REP. MCDADE: Would you give us--

SEN. PENA: I'd be happy to give you a list of --
REP. MCDADE: Well no, I was going to ask you to, if you would just gret (ph) upon the record at this juncture the consequences if your department and others, you are the lead agency from the Federal Government. If it doesn't get done expeditiously, what are the consequences?
SEN. PENA: There draconian, Mr. Chairman just speaking very generally, it would effect our ability to do stockpile stewardship. It would effect virtually all the science work we do throughout the complex. It would effect again major operations of the department and that's why it is a must do priority.
REP. MCDADE: I agree with you, it's to a lot of people just a peripheral issue. In fact, it's a core issue that we have to deal with.
Mr. Secretary there are no more questions from the subcommittee. We want to thank you for your appearance, you've done a fine job and your testimony will be very helpful to the committee in reaching it's conclusion.
SEN. PENA: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
