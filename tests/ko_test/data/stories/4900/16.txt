It's Lights, Cameras and Deregulation

After five years of debate, planning and false starts, California deregulated its $ 23 billion electricity market yesterday without a hitch, according to initial reports.
The first movement in the new deregulated market began at about 5 a.m., when the Alhambra-based California Power Exchange opened for business, selling power at public auction for the first time.
Some 511,000 megawatts of electricity, 80 percent of the electricity used by the state's 10 million customers, traded in the two-hour-long market.
Prices for electricity for delivery today ranged from a low of zero per megawatt hour for electricity to be generated from 1 a.m. to 2 a.m. to $ 24.44 a megawatt hour for electricity from 8 a.m. to 9 a.m.
Some generators offered to give their power away for free during the midnight hours, a time of low energy use, according to Dennis Loughridge, chief executive of the PX. That's because it can be more expensive to shut down certain power plants, such as coal-driven operations, than to keep them running.
Loughridge said the average price of electricity sold yesterday was $ 19.73 a megawatt hour. That compares with a rough, pre-deregulation average of $ 24 a megawatt hour. However, Loughridge noted that moderate spring weather conditions meant that energy is likely to be less expensive now than it will be in the heat of the summer.
''These prices were pretty much what we were expecting,'' said Mike Florio, a senior attorney with the Utility Reform Network and a member of both the PX and California Independent System Operator governing boards.
Loughridge called it a ''great day'' for the agency, which started only 10 months ago and has been beleaguered by computer glitches. He said there were no computer problems and that the market performed more efficiently than it had during more than three months of testing.
After the auction, which closed at 7 a.m., bidding data from the PX was transferred to the California Independent System Operator in Folsom. The ISO is responsible for scheduling which companies will deliver how much power at what time through California's high-voltage electrical grid system that covers 124,000 square miles.
Prices are adjusted by a second round of bidding if the ISO finds there is too much power scheduled to run through particular zones at any one time.
The ISO also helps establish prices for emergency back-up power.
''The level of bidding activity was higher than we anticipated,'' said ISO chief executive Jeffrey Tranen. He said there were 19 participants in the process. The biggest were California's three major utility companies -- Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric.
''The market worked faster than it did in testing and more people participated,'' said Tranen.
Tranen defended the huge $ 400 million start-up costs for the PX and the ISO, saying the costs would be justified by the more efficient market they help create.
The ISO was scheduled to take over the operation of California's vast electricity grid at midnight last night.
''We've accomplished what many thought was impossible,'' said Tranen at a brief ceremony at the ISO. ''We've made history.''
Today, the 40,000 or so customers who have already switched energy companies will get their power from a new supplier. However, the major investor-owned utilities will still be responsible for delivering the electricity.
