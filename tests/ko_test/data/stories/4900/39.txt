D-Day for Electricity Deregulation Starting now, customers can choose power vendors

California flips the switch today on a huge and historic experiment to deregulate the state's $ 23 billion electricity market.
The long-awaited move means 27 million customers will have the right to choose who they will buy their electricity from.
As one of the first states to deregulate its electricity industry, California's experiment will be widely watched by others who are contemplating opening their power market.
''Today's action opens the door for competition in the electricity industry,'' said Governor Pete Wilson. ''By eliminating the monopoly, we are giving California residents and businesses a real choice in selecting their electricity provider.''
Nowhere are nerves more on edge than in a small office park in the town of Folsom.
That's where the newly created Independent System Operator takes over responsibility for an electrical grid system that serves 27 million customers and spans 124,000 square miles.
It will be their job to make sure the power gets where it needs to go. ''I won't tell you I'm not nervous, but we are ready to go,'' said Terry Winter, the system's chief operating officer.
Winter has reason to be edgy. Electricity deregulation was postponed December 31 when the nonprofit Independent System Operator and its sister agency, the California Power Ex change, were unable to unsnarl computer glitches that had bedeviled their systems. And it was only two weeks ago that a required seven-day test of error-free operation was completed.
Under deregulation, the system operator is assuming computerized command of the long- distance, high-voltage power lines that deliver electricity throughout the state. It is taking over the job that had been performed separately by the state's major utilities -- Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Edison Electric and San Diego Gas & Electric.
Early yesterday, the last hurdles toward deregulation were cleared. First, the chief executives of the state's three major utilities, including San Francisco's PG&E Corp., certified that the system operator was ready to handle the electrical grid without suffering blackouts or computer malfunctions.
Shortly afterward, the California Public Utilities Commission signed the final authorization deregulating the electricity industry.
Not everyone agrees with the final form of energy deregulation.
''I'm glad the ISO is working, but I am completely underwhelmed by this version of deregulation,'' said Nette Hoge, director of the Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco consumer group.
Hoge and other consumer activists argue that electricity deregulation has been transformed into a bailout for the big utility companies.
In exchange for their agreement not to oppose deregulation, utility companies won the right to collect their so-called ''stranded costs.'' These costs represent the debt they owed on nuclear power plants and long-term energy contracts.
These costs, which customers will be paying for the next four years, will keep electricity prices a good 30 percent higher than they would have been, experts said.
The short-term benefit consumers will receive is the 10 percent rate reduction that went into effect January 1. However, payment on the bonds that helped finance the rate reduction reduces this benefit to a rate cut of about 3 percent, according to the consumer arm of the Public Utilities Commission.
So far, more than 200 power companies have registered to sell electricity in California. Most of the new energy service providers, however, intend to sell electricity to businesses rather than consumers.
Unlike the deregulation of the long-distance telephone market, where vast numbers of people switched phone companies, business and residential energy customers are taking a wait-and-see attitude.
Only about 40,000 customers have told the state's big utilities that they want to switch to another power company. And of that number, less than half are residential customers.
Under deregulation, customers are not forced to switch from the utility that currently provides them power. They can do nothing and still received the 10 percent rate reduction.
Consumers and businesses will begin to see more substantial savings in electricity prices in four years, when the utility's stranded costs are paid off, most observers agree.
The first act in the new deregulated market was scheduled for 5 a.m. today with the opening of the California Power Exchange. The Alhambra-based agency is the market where buyers and sellers of electricity meet and settle on the price of power for each hour of the following day.
Once the winning bids are reached, the agency moves that data to the system operator by 10 a.m. The system operator then uses that data to schedule the flow of electricity through California's grid system.
''We're the air traffic controllers of the electrical grid,'' said Independent System Operator Chief Executive Jeffrey Tranen. ''If we do our job right, you won't know we're here.''
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
.
Starting today, California deregulates its electricity market. This will allow you to select your own power company, much as you can pick a long-distance phone company.
* What do I get out of it? Starting today, you'll get a 10 percent rate reduction on the electricity portion of your utility bill. The Legislature approved the rate cut as a condition for deregulation.
* Is there a catch? Yes. You and other consumers will wind up footing the bill for the rate reduction by paying off $ 7 billion in 10- year bonds used to finance the plan. Consumers also will be responsible for $ 28 billion to cover the electric companies' money-losing investments.
* Do I have to do anything? The selection of a new electric company is not mandatory. You can stick with Pacific Gas and Electric. In either case, no change in equipment or wiring is necessary.
* Who do I call when the power goes out? You still call PG&E. The generation of electricity has been deregulated, but the utility will still deliver power to homes and businesses in Northern California.
