REP. RON PACKARD (R-CA): I will call the hearing to order. We certainly are grateful to have you back with us again -- (inaudible) -- first time before this subcommittee, but it won't be your last.
We're looking forward to your testimony. I've read it through, I've been telling my clerk, it's kind of messed up in terms of the way I've marked it up and asked questions because I was reading it while I was on the treadmill last night, and that's not easy to make notes while you're on the treadmill. But I do appreciate your submitting it to us and it's well organized and well presented and we're looking forward to having you present your testimony.
I would appreciate you summarizing, perhaps, covering the highlights, rather than reading the testimony to us, most of us have read it. And in our deliberations today, I hope that we will be able to get into some discussions about some specifics relative to the privatization program. We have been very strong advocates of the privatization program, and it didn't initiate with me as chairman, but it's been an ongoing program to see how we can better fill the need on quality of life issues.
And we think it's moving in the right direction, although we do have some concerns, and we may want to address those concerns, and certainly they may come up in the questions and answers period.
Mr. Kramer?
MR. KRAMER: We a --
REP. PACKARD: -- some of the concerns are that we are quickly moving into large, large, large projects before we really had a chance to test out the smaller projects that have been underway. Two or three hundred homes, we feel comfortable that that's a good test bet to determine if it's going to work. Two or three thousand homes, we have some concerns about. At least this early. It may be that it will work put. We're going in an almost irreversible direction.
It appears that in our efforts to move into privatization that we're moving so rapidly that we may be scuttling the traditional way we've built homes for the services in the past. And in every group that we've had before us in our hearings this year, the answer to the question, 'are we replacing the traditional way of building housing and quality of life facilities with the privatization', the answer has been no, but it appears that may be where we are headed. I'd be very anxious to hear your observations in that area.
We also are delaying the appropriations and the actual spending of moneys waiting for privatization to really get going and that's of some concern.
Perhaps, thirdly, and maybe more importantly of all of the other concerns is that I'm not sure that we see a very well defined evaluation and analysis laid out to see if, in fact, this is the right way to go. I would much prefer to have to make changes in the program early on than to wait until we've had some failures or some really serious problems arise, and it's very possible in the new direction that we're going.
We simply cannot see all the eventualities. We don't know all of the nuances. And I'm not sure we have a performance system well identified that will tell us if we're moving in the right directions and tell us that soon enough where we could make some changes. The construction industry at best is a precarious industry and there are all kinds of possibilities for failure. Talk to any contractor or general contractor and they'll certainly tell you there can be unforeseen problems, financing may not always work out the way they're planned, contracts may not always work out the way they were designed.
And we would like to know if there's been some thinking and some directions in terms of, what if this happens that doesn't make it all pencil out the way we've anticipated, where do we go from there, and is it the right direction? Performance standards, performance evaluation is something that we're concerned about, I am.
But overall, I don't want that to sound like we're negative on privatization because we're not. We think that it is a very positive, new approach to trying to close the gap. One of the concerns I have is that the primary purposes of looking at privatization and moving in that direction is that it would close the gap much quicker, and we may not be closing it as quickly as we'd hoped under the current process. Secondly, that we might save money and we're not sure that that's happening.
And thirdly, that we would be able to transfer to our servicemen and women some ability to develop and equity. Those were three, it think, very fundamental purposes that we would like to see and evaluate whether, in fact, those purposes are going to be realized with this new approach.
I probably said a lot more than I intended to, but I simply wanted to let you know that even though this subcommittee, and certainly me as the chairman are very supportive of the privatization effort, I think there are some yellow lights up there that we would like to at least determine if it's going to work out the way we all hope that it will.
And so with those comments, do either of you, Mr. Kramer or -- (inaudible) -- have any opening comments, if not, we will go ahead. And then we will just open up with a few questions and answers. We're looking forward to your testimony. Again we have it before us, and we've reviewed it so if you'd like to summarize in any way you'd like.
MR. JOHN GOODMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, I'd like to note that in our first meeting together you strongly expressed your support for privatization as a principle of government, that it was an important way of reducing the size of government and improving the quality of service that we can provide. My testimony today is about housing, but as we discussed last year, this year the department is moving forward in other areas, in utilities, which was a recommendation of yours.
I'm pleased to be here today to talk about the housing privatization program. With your permission I'd like to submit my written statement for the record. REP. PACKARD: Absolutely.
MR. GOODMAN: And in light of your comments, rather than simply summarizing my testimony, I would really rather address some of the questions and issues that you've raised, because as I have been reviewing this program in preparation for my testimony, I have also been listening to the kinds of concerns that you've expressed, and I'd like to talk to you just a little bit about them.
I don't need to tell anyone on this committee how important housing is to the quality of life, nor do I need to tell anyone on this committee how important good planning is to management. For these combined reasons, Deputy Secretary Hamre this last year established an important role. Namely he directed military departments, eliminated our inventory of inadequate housing by the year 2010. That's a big job, because we have 300,000 houses, two- thirds of which are in desperate need of repair or replacement. We also frankly still have a deficit up there and could benefit from more houses.
Using traditional procurement, it would cost us at least $20 billion and given even previous years' funding levels, because I recognized the comment in your comment about our current funding level, but even in previous years' funding levels, that would take us about 30 years to solve.
As you have noted, that's simply unacceptable. That's why this housing privatization issue is so important to Secretary Cohen. The tools that you provided, which we are now using in this five year test period provide the means to leverage our resources. With these tools we can get leverage of at least three to one.
With some of our projects, we've found that that leverage rate is 30 to one. That means we can get significant more housing for the dollars that you're providing than we could through our traditional tools. Now I completely share and agree with earlier witnesses, I know Bill Lynn (sp) was here who noted that the department's goal is not to replace MILCON with privatization, it's an addition. It's an additional tool. And frankly it's too early to tell, as you have noted. But indications are that it certainly does provide the possibility to put our young men and women in uniform with more and better housing, cheaper, and faster than would otherwise be possible.
That's why the initiative is so important.
And we've made progress in our first two years, but it's a little less than we'd hoped. And I'd like to explain why.
First, the program was a new start. It required the department to learn how to deal with the real estate community, with the financial community, to learn how to analyze the viability of projects. Until the housing revitalization support office gained experience, initial analyses were long.
Now part of the reason why this was important, and I testified to this last year, is that while we wanted to use these tools as much as possible, we only wanted to wrap up consistent with our ability to manage the program, with our ability to insure the government's long term financial interests, and with our ability to insure the kind of management issues, Mr. Chairman that you raised in your opening statement.
The second cause of delay is that when we entered the program, we did not have approved scoring guidelines from the Office of Management and Budget. I talked a little bit about this last year. It wasn't until June last year that OMB established appropriate rules to support obligations to the government incurred by the use of these new authorities. That delay essentially put our work on hold.
When the guidelines were established, they contained some rules that were different than had been incorporated in our initial analyses. How, for example, utilities should be treated in the financial calculations. That meant that we had to go back and redo the kind of detailed pro-form analysis the detailed life-cycle cost analysis that we thought was important to insure that we were getting the most for our money that we were able to protect the government's interests.
Third, developing the loan and loan-guarantee instruments you provided to us proved time-consuming because we needed to work with the financial community to translate the concept of loan-guarantees into actual documents that would receive favorable, and by favorable, investment grade financing. The last thing we wanted, of course, was to have projects which only qualified for junk financing.
Certainly that was not our intention for this kind of project. These had to be projects with financial instruments that Standard & Poor's and others would consider of investment grade. We wanted their review. In some sense, we wanted their underwriting of the project to supplement our own to insure that we were managing it well.
Finally, and this leads into a point, Mr. Chairman, that you raised and that I want to address. There was some uncertainty at different levels in the services as to whether this initiative would work. Uncertainty, frankly, that was compounded by the long deliberations over scoring rules. This uncertainty led the services to delay making decisions about whether or not to propose a project to the Housing Revitalization Support Office for privatization.
The way we have set up the program, and it was very important to the services, is that the services would propose individual projects. In essence, my role, and my office's role was to insure that these projects were financially viable, to insure that they were sound, that the management plan was sound, and that the implementation, the procurement process was run by the services. What I'm noting is that the proposals for the projects proved very slow in coming. This goes to the third point I wanted to make.
The slow decision making on whether or not to proceed with the projects on the part of the services delayed execution of projects and delayed execution and transfer of MILCON authority. In preparation for this hearing, Mr. Chairman and members of this committee, I learned the extent of those delays. Some extend back to 1996. I know that you and other members of this committee are frustrated by this delay. I want to tell you, so am I. I was, frankly, surprised to learn how large this backlog was and I appreciate the committee's highlighting this issue. As I noted, I've seen the projects when the proposals came forward and that's the point at which I went to work, but I realize there is a significant backlog here and we need to do something about it. I want to tell you what I am going to do.
To correct this situation, next week I called for a summit meeting to include all key personnel from the services and from the -- (inaudible). I want to identify what money is being held up and why it is being held up. For each project, I'll demand that the services working with HRSO, that's the Housing Revitalization Support Office, establish a schedule for using the new authorities or proceeding with MILCON. I want to and will share these schedules with this committee. Paralysis by analysis, or worse, indecision, simply cannot continue.
Now moving forward, Mr. Chairman, here's what we'll do to prevent this kind of problem from reoccurring. There are a few actions that we'll take. First it's important to note that HRSO is getting ahead of the curve in their site review process. Already HRSO has conducted site analyses at more than 30 locations and that number is growing steadily. That means, unlike the past, we'll not need to wait to determine whether a privatization project will work or not.
Increasingly we'll have that information ahead of time. Now in the past, the HRSO team as I noted conducted a site analysis and then awaited the services decision to record. As I noted in many cases, that decision simply did not come. To prevent future delays, we are going to modify our procedures and establish a deadline for an up or down decision on the part of the services on how to proceed with that project.
Finally, now that we're beginning to get ahead of the curve in terms of the kinds of analyses that are required to figure out whether privatization projects will work, I think the services can and need to begin making privatization decisions in the budget planning process. In next year's budget bill, I'll therefore recommend that each of the services specifically budget for these revitalization initiatives. In short, we'll clear out the execution backlog, we'll set procedures to prevent its recurrence, we'll establish schedules that we'll share with you and we'll begin the process of budgeting directly.
Now fourth, one of the reasons that this information about delayed execution is so frustrating to me is that I think in many other respects, the program is making real progress and I think that this committee and Congress should be very proud of that progress, because it provides significant improvements in the quality of life to our young men and women in uniform and their families.
It provides the kind of housing that we all know that they deserve and we all believe is absolutely critical to retaining the kind of skilled motivated young folks that we have. We resolved the scoring issue, we've developed a trained housing revitalization office, we've obtained and have under contract now leading financial and real estate firms to advise us and to help us do a lot of the analysis and work with the real estate community.
And I would note, Mr. Chairman, you had asked a question about our evaluation and analytical process, I would be delighted to share this approach and this material with the committee because frankly I think it is very, very rigorous. We do detailed pro-form financial analysis, we do detailed life-cycle cost analysis all before we decide to move ahead.
Before a project moves forward, there are a number of things that I want to know. First, of course, is does it meet the needs of the installation and the men and women in uniform, but from a financial perspective, is the project financially feasible? Will it save us money over the long run? Is there a management plan to insure that we can take care of the needs of this project over the long run. These are all things that we look at.
Our RFP's are focusing, not just on getting a project out on the street, but insuring there is a good financial and management plan to insure that once it's built that the project is well managed and that we have procedures in place to insure that the commander at the base is able to have significant influence over the direction and the upkeep of these projects.

One of the great benefits to this program, is that while I think we have done a good job building houses, the department services, frankly, have not done a good job of taking acre of the houses that we have. With our analyses in these projects and with what we are requiring, we're requiring the projects to maintain reserves to insure that they are able to be maintained in ways that, frankly, we have just not done a very good job doing, and I can come to you every year and tell you it's a real concern to us and we want to do a better job.
But the department doesn't do as good a job as we should, keeping reserves, just as a private sector real estate project would do, to ensure that the project maintains value. That's what we've been working on on the programmatic side. In terms of projects, we've completed two projects, we have two projects that we hope we can soon award at Fort Carson, Colorado, and Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, and we're moving forward on seven other projects. Altogether these projects encompass 18,000 units. That's real leverage. Those are 18,000 new, replaced, or revitalized units that will provide the kind of housing as I noted that we all want to give our men and women and their families.
In keeping with my earlier commitment, Mr. Chairman, I'll provide this committee with copies of the specific schedules, mutually agreed upon by my offices, the comptroller, and the services for these projects. And let me assure you that I will monitor closely their performance to assure that those schedules are achieved because I know you have a concern about this and so do I.
The fifth point I want to raise is that I think it's important to keep in mind that these projects are not just collections of houses. They are communities, and that's important to us in both how we design the project, in how we prepare it, and in what we're asking for. First in the design of the projects, not only is the commander closely involved in this, but so too are the families now living on the base.
Mr. Chairman, in our first meeting, you raised this issue to me. You believed that we needed to have families involved in the decision making process, and in my approval of every project, I've made it a requirement that the R&D process, the development of the concept of the project involve not just the top brass, but involve service members and their families.
Second, in the construction of the facilities, the projects involve more than just houses. We're requiring community centers, playgrounds, recreational facilities and parks. Those are the kind of facilities where families can get together, where communities are built, all of which contribute to the quality of life and enable our families to enjoy the same physical, cultural, and social amenities I think are such an important part of the culture of our uniform forces.
In closing, Mr. Chairman, I want to thank this committee for its support. I share your frustration and have outlined a series of steps that will clear up the backlog in execution and I believe will prevent its recurrence. We need to do that because this initiative is critical. It's critical to the secretary, it's critical to all of the military departments, and most of all, it's critical to provide quality housing to young men and women in uniform and their families. Thank you very much.
REP. PACKARD: Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. We appreciate Mr. Hefner being with us this morning. Did you have any opening statement or comments that you'd like to make?
REP. BILL HEFNER (D-NC): I have Mr. Chairman, I have an opening statement, but what I would prefer to do is I have a couple of questions, lengthy questions I'd like to just do at the appropriate time, and just welcome Mr. Goodman to the committee.
REP. PACKARD: This may be the appropriate time.
(Laughter.)
You first then we'll go to Mr. Kramer.
REP. HEFNER: Would you agree that your housing projects that are already funded should go forward as intended by Congress and they should not be held hostage while you work out the bugs in privatization. Now we've heard that there -- you're not going to save any moneys, but you're going to speed up the process. You know all the houses are not inadequate, and there are many quality units being held up, we think, because of this, and let me just follow along those lines.
There's one housing project that was funded at Fort Bragg last year, and it's been held up while you develop your privatization methods, and I was surprised to hear this, because the original project was very badly needed and privatization is going to hold the relief of these families up for several years.
In March, 1997 you testified before this committee that 42 sites had been identified as privatization candidates. They were candidates, not necessarily that they would go, but they were candidates. In February of 1997, the DOD issued revitalization of military housing report, the first year of the housing privatization initiative. Appendix C of that report is the site nomination list. 43 sites are listed as nominated, and I'll assume that's the 43 sites that you were referring to in your testimony.
Well among the nominees that you list, one is Fort Bragg. Now, they're of course no great details about the nomination. Next I might call your attention to the FY 1998 budget justification materials submitted to the committee by the DOD and credited by us as part of the hearing record. Now, could you tell me how many of these projects that have been funded and are scheduled to go are being held up so that you can work out your bugs in the privatization.
And that's not a parochial thing for me and I feel should other members on the committee also would like to have that information because I don't think this is what we understood when we were funding these projects, and they were ready to go, and I don't think they should be held hostage till you work the bugs out of privatization. If you could just set my mind at ease about that.
MR. GOODMAN: Mr. Hefner, you've raised a number of questions. Let me try to address each one in turn, and I think they're important questions. First, I just want to disagree with the characterization, or rather want to explain the characterization when people say we're not going to save money from these projects. We are going to save money for these projects. One of the conditions for approval, from my perspective is, there is life-cycle savings, one. And two, that --
REP. HEFNER: Would you just hold it there just a minute. We may have a vote here. That's a debate that's going to continue, whether you're going to save money or not, we've gone through that argument on base closures. Out in the future, they're may be savings, what have you, but we understand the reasons that we're going to the privatization, it speeds up -- that's not the questions that I'm asking. The question I want answered is, is that the case, that projects are being held up to either work out the bugs, and if they are where are they?
MR. GOODMAN: Let me answer your question in two parts. The first part is the view of the chiefs, the view of the military departments is that when and where we can leverage our resources and get three to 30 times as much houses for our young men and women, that that is something that we ought to do. Frankly, given the quality of life challenge that we have, we have to do everything we can to speed revitalization of houses. Mr. Hefner, I am going to address the second part of your question. I'm not avoiding it.
REP. HEFNER: The point I'm making is, this doesn't make any sense to hold up projects that are ready to go, that people are waiting on, that's going to inconvenience them, until you get the bugs worked out. MR. GOODMAN: The second point, and I may have passed this point in my oral statement before you arrived, is that as I prepared for this hearing, I became aware of the delays in the execution of projects. Honestly sir, I was not aware of the extent of that, because the services were the ones who were proposing projects to me. Let me clarify what something was a proposed candidate. The service was interested in looking at it. At that point, the HRSO team went out and actually did the detailed analysis that would demonstrate that privatization was feasible. At that point it went back to the military department for decision.
What I have learned as I have prepared for this hearing is the fact that there are 96 projects that are on hold, that there are 97 projects that are on hold, and there's a sizable amount of money there. And that does concern me, sir, so what I had stated is that next week -- I don't have all the information on that because that has not been part of my role in the process.
So next week I have called a summit meeting with the comptroller and the services because I think we owe you, frankly, I think we owe it to ourselves and we owe you a clear schedule of how we are going to proceed, and that we cannot continue simply to delay. We either have to be able to demonstrate to you that there is a clear privatization project with significant leverage that we can obtain. Or we need to cut bait and move forward.
It may be worth a short delay of a MILCON project to determine whether three to 30 times the housing units makes sense. It is not worth a long delay, and in my oral statement, it is not in my written statement, Mr. Hefner, I apologize for that. I had prepared my oral statement last weekend and my written statement. As I was preparing for this I learned new data that caused me great concern. I think a short delay may be acceptable, a long delay is not, and I've outlined in my written statement a range of a number of new procedures to be able to insure that those delays are sort rather than long.
I know how important the issues are in Fort Bragg. I've traveled down there, I've gone running around the base, and right before he left command, General Keene (sp) called me and asked me for my support for the Fort Bragg privatization project because in his view it was the only way that he was going to be able to insure that we were going to be able to take care of the needs of the young soldiers and their families. So I am not happy, Mr. Hefner about the delay there, and I will come back to you and this committee with a schedule about how we're going to proceed.
REP. HEFNER: General Keene was in my office last week, we work with him very closely. All I want you to do is shoot straight with us where we can know what we're doing. We have enough problems on this committee -- (inaudible). I would just certainly appreciate that when you give your testimony and we read the record and we find some discrepancies, whether their overt or something you overlooked, or what have you. We need to have a good relationship here because this is something, this privatization business is something I have real reservations about as I did (801 housing ?) want to get the most for the money for our troops. We don't want to give away too much and make too much of a sacrifice just to experiment. And I would urge you to be very specific in front of to know where we're going and what the situation is. And with that, Mr. Chairman I'll yield back my time.
REP. PACKARD: Thank you. Mr. Olver?
Okay, no questions at this time.
Let me go into a couple of things then. As I read your testimony, and then I'll get into some of the prepared questions. I'm looking for information more than questioning what you've said. On the projects that are in procurement, Fort Carson, Colorado project, this will be our largest project to date, 2,600 units, and in both of these procurement projects that are in procurement now, Lackland and Fort Carson, it's anticipated that the housing allowance will cover the entire cost of the lease or rent?
MR. GOODMAN: Yes.
REP. PACKARD: How have you projected that with some accuracy for 50 year contracts?
MR. GOODMAN: We've used normal escalator clauses in the kind of cost-of-living adjustments in that and we have provided that information to the bidders.
REP. PACKARD: How can you -- even builders that build or retain ownership of section eight housing in HUD, they run into unforeseen gyrations in the market or it doesn't pencil out after say five years because there's a depression or an increased evaluation or a variety of reasons why their projections did not fulfill themselves, and for 50 years that is really a difficult process. What would happen if, say the owner, the contractor came back to you 10 years from now which is only a fifth into the 50 year contract, and said the housing allowance is simply not covering the cost of maintaining an ownership and servicing the debt and so forth. We can't continue. What happens?
MR. GOODMAN: Mr. Chairman, we are assured. I mean one of the things when we're looking at our analysis is what's the debt coverage ratio? Are we able to insure with very conservative assumptions that the debt is going to be covered? If the developer or the owner finds himself or herself unable to proceed or in default, they have a problem with their lender.
REP. PACKARD: Well, they do, but the problem is we're the lender in some instances. In Lackland, of course, as you've outlined the government will have some form of limited of limited loan guarantee, so we become the guaranteeable loan, and on the second mortgage, we become the mortgagor.
MR. GOODMAN: Well, neither at Lackland or at Fort Carson are we guaranteeing the loan against economic risk. But the critical point is that we are projecting, we are certainly projecting forward what the anticipated escalation could be in terms of their cost. There are a couple of kinds of costs that can rise. We are asking them to budget for their reserves, we are going to be monitoring that process as they move forward and we are overseeing this process as part of a management committee.
REP. PACKARD: I think that the thing that I'm hoping we are able to do, and I'm not sure how well we can do it on a long term lease is that we would not find ourselves as we move ourselves into this kind of approach in a big way, with multiple, multiple contracts, dozens and dozens, 30 or 40 contracts over -- (inaudible) -- years, and then find that for some reason the owner walks away.
Simply says it's not penciling out for me and I'm going to walk away. And then we not only have one project, we could have multiple projects come back on us with some real dilemmas, and I'm trying to look ahead and see what those kinds of dilemmas are and what kinds of problems they would confront this committee with, having to come up with unexpected moneys, embarrassments that what we've planned and set up simply didn't work out. I'm looking to avoid those kinds of problems.
MR. GOODMAN: Mr. Chairman, absolutely. First I should note it's my understanding, if there ever were a default, it comes out of the Treasury, not out of the Defense budget. So I think you're off the hook, and Mr. Chairman that wasn't my complete answer. See, frankly I think the greater risk is during the construction period, rather than during the management period, because where these projects, for the developer, will really pay off is by managing the project over the long run. That's where they're going to be getting their fees to justify the initial investment -- REP. PACKARD: Is that where the loan guarantees are? In the construction phase?
MR. GOODMAN: The loan guarantees that we are providing are as limited as possible and they are focusing on what I characterize as political risk. Namely, the risk that the base might close. If it were the case that a base might close, in certain communities, then it might well be that there are not other civilians who can move into those housings and that could trigger a default, and if it triggered a default, that's what we're providing coverage for because developers simply will not move into a community -- the developers' standard implores, the underwriters, the banks, they can evaluate the economic risk, but they can't evaluate, however, the political risk and that's what the guarantee is providing.
REP. PACKARD: Are you committing in your contracts, are you committing all of the housing allowance? Are you committing all of the airmen or soldiers' housing allowance in perpetuity or at least for the 50 year contract? If we increased the housing allowance 20 percent over the next five years, would that automatically go to the contractor or is there some adjustments there, is there some consideration? We are committing to the housing allowance as it now exists, but supposing that housing allowance varies either up or down? How is that written into the contract?
MR. GOODMAN: Mr. Chairman, that's a detail on which I'm going to --
REP. PACKARD: And I don't mean to micromanage -
MR. GOODMAN: Not at all, sir. I think it's a perfectly reasonable question. Under our agreement, contract terms would then be renegotiated.
REP. PACKARD: So as the housing allowance changes, there's an opportunity to renegotiate?
MR. GOODMAN: Yes, yes and Mr. Chairman, one of the things that I have wanted to make sure that we have as well in our contract terms is that if the projects, you talked about the downside risk. Obviously the safe and conservative thing to look at. In addition, I think we need to look at the upside risk on the developers side, because we certainly don't want to be creating huge windfall profits for the developer, we want to make sure that if they are making, for no fault of their own, are making a lot more money than was anticipated, that we get more for it.
REP. PACKARD: Well I would hat to see us create a situation where our deliberations on whether we ought to increase or adjust the housing allowance is made on the basis of what kind of multiple contractors have out there that would create a windfall for a developer, and that would not be a good circumstance for us to put on ourselves. We ought to be able to make those decisions based on what's good for the servicemen and women, not on what's good for the contractors that may be affected by housing allowance adjustment.
MR. GOODMAN: You're absolutely right because 70 percent of our people don't live in government housing now, they live on the economy, and we need not lose sight of those folks while we're just focusing on our housing project. I agree with you and we're including that in our contractual terms.
REP. HEFNER: When you put together this 50 year projection, did you use a program that showed a floor on the monthly payments or whatever, that you had a floor that you couldn't go below that, so the contractor could make his determination that it won't be less than so and so?
MR. GOODMAN: Certainly.
REP. HEFNER: Was that figured into the model?
MR. GOODMAN: Certainly if Congress were to abolish, God forbid, our housing allowances, that would be a serious problem for the projects, but I certainly don't think we anticipate that happening at all.
REP. HEFNER: I've got to tell you, I've said this before. I would like to be a contractor and do nothing but build if I was guaranteed full occupancy, and I was guaranteed that I was going to make a big profit, and at a certain time if I did decide to go belly up, the lender is going to be responsible. And then the lender is going to come to the government and we're going to pick up the tab. That's a pretty good deal. It's sort of the only risk-free business that I can think of right now.
MR. GOODMAN: Well, Mr. Hefner, let me just clarify that we are not guaranteeing occupancy. And that was one of the rules that the Office of Management and Budget laid forward. Our families have the right of first refusal on the units, but we are not guaranteeing the developer that they will live there.
REP. HEFNER: Let's be realistic about this. If you're going to build 300 units on the base, as short as we are on housing, that's pretty much a guarantee you're going to have full occupancy. I don't mean to be argumentative, but I've just got some concerns about -- I don't want to belabor this.
REP. PACKARD: I want to get to Mr. Edwards as quickly as I can . Let me just finish up on this though. Not only do we not wish to create a disparity and complicate the decision making process of adjustments to the housing allowance, but are we creating a greater disparity between families that have to live on the economy, and families that can qualify for these new housing arrangements and have their allowance cover the entire cost? That's already a disparity that's a concern of this committee. Those that have to live on the economy simply because we don't have the adequate housing that their housing allowance covers. Are we creating or helping that problem? Are we creating a greater problem or diminishing the problem? That's the question.
MR. GOODMAN: First, I share your view that that disparity is a problem. I have not seen a privatization as the means to be able to resolve that. I think it's a very complicated problem.
REP. PACKARD: But does it exacerbate that problem?
MR. GOODMAN: No, sir, to the contrary. In fact, what I think it does is it simply insures that people who are living in on-base housing or in government projects are living in adequate quality housing. We've had this sort of strange compromise in the past, you can either take your money and go out on the economy, or you can live on-base, no out of pocket expense, but your house might be crumbling, and not in very good condition.
We certainly don't want that to happen. If anything, in a number of these projects, and frankly, in some of the larger projects, we're able to significantly build down the deficit. Part of the plan at Fort Bragg, part of the plan at Fort Carson with 800 new houses, part of the plan at Fort Hood, part of the plan at Pendleton. In that respect we're able to help more people who would like to live on base, either because of cost reasons or because the kind of community reasons that motivate a number of members, especially in those forces where the service member deploys. So I think this helps rather than hurts.
REP. PACKARD: Thank you. Mr. Edwards. I'm sorry we were slow in getting to you.
REP. CHET EDWARDS (R-TX): First let me just thank you for calling a hearing. I happen to be one who strongly believes in trying this program because I've seen the frustration of how long it would take through the traditional process to provide for adequate housing, Children who are babies now will be 30 years old by the time the housing is upgraded by the traditional process.
As a believer in the program, I think that the tough questions you're asking and Mr. Hefner and the points he's made are very important, and I hope I've committed to work with you, Mr. Secretary to work out whatever problems might exist. I assume that just like any major procurement program, in a way this is a new procurement program, whether it's aircraft carriers or Air Force planes, they always start up with problems, but my urging to you would be to encourage everybody in the department to take your bureaucratic hats off if necessary and be decisive.
Get some of these projects up and going because a lot of these hypothetical questions we can't and you can't answer honestly until the projects are off the ground. I also hope that the traditional MILCON projects haven't been unnecessarily delayed, we ask that you can work through that. If you don't work through those problems, the program might come tumbling down before it's ever given a chance to succeed.
Because I was late and I apologize for that, I had another hearing, can I ask you again to go back to the basic reason Congress put in place this program? Under traditional MILCON,. What is the cycle for upgrading inadequate housing in our military installations, and what will this system if we get it up and running offer effectively, what will this do to that cycle?
MR. GOODMAN: With an inventory of 200,000 houses that needed repair or replacement, with any kind of reasonable funding projection, it would cost at least $20 billion, current dollars and take about 30 years to resolve that problem. More in some services, tougher for the Marine Corps, tougher for the Army than for the Navy or the Air Force, but still very tough. I think the reason that Congress took this important and innovative step is that it recognized that as much as we would like to be able to solve the problem using our traditional determinate approach, we just weren't going to get there.
REP. EDWARDS: I think everyone on this committee wished we had more funding for this subcommittee, but the reality is that it's not there.
MR. GOODMAN: Mr. Edwards, if I might, in some ways I think this helps achieve a number of the other objectives of this committee, because I do believe that we are saving money, we're getting more good housing up front. That means that we'll be able to devote more resources to barracks and the other kind of operational facilities that are very important that affect quality of life at the workplace, but I'm sure you all would agree we need to do a better job too.
REP. EDWARDS: Mr. Secretary, could I ask, obviously Fort Carson has taken longer than any of us including myself had thought it would take. This project at Fort Hood -- (inaudible) -- to having dealt with the problems you've dealt with, now for new projects starting today, you get the authorization to develop the project at installation XYZ, how long will it take from the initial approval to actually having a military family move in.
MR. GOODMAN: What we are working towards is having all of our site visits complete, so we know ahead of time, before money is authorized and appropriated, whether or not a privatization project will work at that particular base. If we have that done, what I stated in my oral statement is that rather than leaving the military department to prevaricate and try to figure out whether or not they want to move forward in this way or that, we need to set a fixed deadline.
I'm not sure right now what that deadline is for a decision. I would like it to be shorter. This is one of the issues that I want to discuss next week with the services in the meeting. At the point where we then go ahead, an RP needs to be written. That has taken probably about six months. I think that can be shortened. That certainly can be shortened with experience. Procurement process then takes about eight to nine months.
So once a decision is made to move forward and to write the RFP, I think the entire award process is in the order of about, this is off the top of my head, about 14, 15 months to award. Mr. Edwards, what I committed to the Chairman, before you arrived, is that, and I think Mr. Hefner emphasized this point and requested, if you will, that there be truth in advertising, and I think that's a very fair request. And what I want to be able to provide to you are the, first the specific schedules and dates of those projects that we are moving forward.
Frankly, in light of some of the delays that I have seen, I want to go back and see those scrubbed with the services, precisely, Mr. Hefner, because once we give them to you, you have a right to expect that that's what we're going to do.
And as I said, second, moving forward, I think we're moving into a position so this whole process will move much more rapidly, but Mr. Edwards, I know that you have a special interest in Fort Hood. I just want to emphasize what the benefits are because this committee authorized appropriated funds for two MILCON projects that were worth about $40 million, and for that money would be able to buy 284 units which is important, but using those funds with the tools that you have provided us will enable Fort Hood to immediately replace 700 existing units, immediately replace them. Construct an additional 350 units, and a lot of those units are four bedroom units that do not exist in Kileen that our young E-1's to E-4's simply can't afford.
They have large families, we need to provide them with quality of life. And in addition to those total of 1,000 new units, the project will renovate over 4,000 existing units on base. So for the same amount of funds that we provide 285 units with traditional tools, we'll get 1,000 new units and 4,000 revitalized units and moreover, we will have a budgeted process set up whereby the developer is going to be maintaining reserves so all of those units are going to be kept up the life over the life of the project. I couldn't guarantee that we would be able to do that for the 284 units that you have appropriated.
REP. EDWARDS: And those are some of the reasons Commander Schwartz (sp), General Schwartz -- (inaudible) -- are very enthusiastic about the program, and I appreciate your working on that. I would just urge you to urge the respective services to take off their bureaucratic hats and put on their entrepreneurial hats and be decisive, move quickly. Try to make every project absolutely perfect before they agree to move on. Too much delay is going to sink this program and for the very numbers that you mention, I'm still strongly supportive of this, and hope that the very fair and tough questions that the Chairman, Mr. Hefner and the others have asked, we can improve this program, not kill it. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
REP. PACKARD: Thank you, Mr. Edwards. Let me get back to your written testimony. On the Camp Pendleton thing, I simply for my own personal edification would like you to provide me with details on that project. Where the 204 units are, the 512 existing units are, and just, I'd like some real detail about that because I'm personally acquainted with Camp Pendleton would help me, -- (inaudible) -- no further questions on that however.
MR. GOODMAN: I'd be delighted.
REP. PACKARD: I would like you to outline the guidelines that you have addressed that the OMB has approved in terms of scoring guidelines. Would you outline what those scoring guidelines are and what changes were made if any to accommodate this whole process of privatization.
MR. GOODMAN: Yes, sir. Most of our initial discussion with OMB focused on figuring out how to determine whether there was enough private sector risk in the projects to benefit from scoring under the Credit Reform Act. And we came to an agreement, under the Credit Reform Act, any direct investment of the project would score it as an upfront obligation.
Any contractual agreement or guarantee is also scored as an up front investment, or the net present value of the funds that are guaranteed or a rental guarantee would be scored as an up front investment. Loans and loan guarantees are scored at the subsidy rate which seeks to estimate what the cost to the government would be from default, and that's why the use of loans and loan guarantee instruments gets us such greater leverage than we can by the other tools.
One of the changes that I noted that are taking place is that OMB's view, which I don't disagree with is that all costs to the project ought to be included one in the analysis, and two, there ought not to be any hidden indirect subsidies by the Department of Defense. Or, to put it differently, a base ought not to be providing additional services that aren't somehow paid for in the project. That particularly effective utility because in our initial two projects, we had not planned, we had planned on providing utilities directly to the project from the base.
OMB rules say that those costs have to be picked up as part of the cost of the project. That meant that you had to go back and redo the numbers and make sure that that would work. I think the guidelines that OMB has put forward are fair. I think they basically insure that the scoring, that these projects are going to be scored in a way that actually accounts for what we're putting in or the risk that we are taking on.
REP. PACKARD: And it permits you to leverage far more than the what the guidelines put forward.
MR. GOODMAN: Well the problem before is that the guidelines kept moving and we never had any agreement, and you know operating in an environment that awkward makes it very hard to plan and hard to do the kind of detailed financial analysis that you have out lined as so important, and we agree.
REP. PACKARD: Would you also provide for the committee a balance plan, what your plan is in terms of balancing out your programs, MILCON, privatization, variable housing allowance. We'd like to know how, if you have an actual plan that including all of these instruments to close the gap, or is all of your energies in' the privatization area.
MR. GOODMAN: Deputy Secretary Hamre directed as part of his direction, that the services eliminate their inventory of inadequate housing by 2010. Directed that they develop detailed installation level plans on how they were going to achieve that objective. The services are now working on those plans. They are not complete. When they are complete, Mr. Chairman, I would be pleased to share those with this committee.
REP. PACKARD: I'm not asking you to go down a different track then. If it's already underway, that's that.
MR. GOODMAN: We've done this in the area of barracks.
REP. PACKARD: Any idea when they might be completed? When they might be available?
MR. GOODMAN: The direction was that they'd be finished later this spring as part of this meeting next week, I wanted to give you a status update of where we're at. We want to know how they're planning to achieve that objective, or how at least at this point they think that they will be able to achieve that objective, and I want to share that with you too.
REP. PACKARD: I was a little concerned to find that initially we had planned to have the backlog resolved with current funding levels in 10 years and it's now stretched to 15. Why is that?
MR. GOODMAN: You mean why the 2010 deadline?
REP. PACKARD: It was originally, I think, earlier. I was wondering why now it's different.
MR. GOODMAN: Honestly, I don't think there's a strong analytical basis for the change. I think when we had looked at the tools, and looked at the kind of -- we had said it would take $20 billion and 30 years to fix the problem, if you could get three to one leverage, we would do it in 10 years. When Deputy Secretary Hamre looked at this I think he like the 2010 date. Mr. Chairman, I'm sure your view, and mine is too, that we ought to do this as fast as we can within the budget available to us.
REP. PACKARD: As you well know, we're realizing rather drastic cuts in these accounts and that's of great concern. Over a third in the last few years, and with the emphasis on privatization, when are we only requesting $7 million in administrative expense per -- for the family housing improvement fund.
MR. GOODMAN: That $7 million are the funds that are required for administration, undertaking the kind of detailed analyses to insure that we're protecting our interests. That's the overhead costs of the program. The actual budgeting for the program, until now, has come first from the funds that you all provided, and second from the transfer of MILCON projects. But, as I've noted, I think we're now at a point when we come forward with our budget request next year, we ought to be identifying specific projects for you that we believe are amenable to privatization so that you have that information up front.
REP. PACKARD: Will that reduce the reliance on transfer authority?
MR. GOODMAN: I can't tell you at this point since we haven't worked this out with the comptroller with the services, how best to identify those projects. One possibility might be to simply identify them. Another might be to create a separate program line item within each service account for privatization. Another possibility would be to put it into a central account. I haven't worked that issue, Mr. Chairman within the building. I don't know where we will come out, but I think we want to be able to identify for you up front as I've noted, what projects we think should involve privatization and which shouldn't.
REP. PACKARD: Mr. Hefner, any questions?
REP. HEFNER: I have just one. That, -- (inaudible) -- authorization subcommittee on installations and services. This week Paul Johnson, the assistant undersecretary of Arms for Installations and Facilities testified as each of the bases where privatization occurs, this will eliminate the housing shortage. Do you agree with that statement?
MR. GOODMAN: Mr. Hefner, I have only carefully looked at four Army housing projects that are part of the 18,000 that I mentioned. Fort Carson, Fort Hood, Fort Lewis (sp), and Fort Stewart (sp). In each of these projects, we are revitalizing the existing housing and significantly buying down the deficit.
I'll need to go back and check if it completely eliminates the deficit in each of those cases. Clearly, one of my objectives in each of these projects is that we are working to eliminate, to buy down that deficit to get more of our soldiers and their families in good housing. Let me take a close look at those projects for the record.
REP. HEFNER: Thank you, Mr. Chairmen, that's all.
REP. PACKARD: Mr. Edwards.
REP. EDWARDS: Mr. Secretary, and this gets into other areas, chiefly the Department of Education, but does anyone that you know of looked at the issue of the impact of this privatization aid -- (inaudible) -- with those students who are presently defined as type-A students that are getting much higher double compensation, they continue to be defined as type-A students or would they go to B?
MR. GOODMAN: Let me, I'm not familiar enough with the program to -- I understand type-A, type-B, but I do know how these kind of projects treat and will affect impact aid. Let me address that. When these projects are on base and people are living on base on a project, provided that these are not (DODES ?) schools, that will affect impact aid, because in essence we are bringing more families onto government properties, and on school system, off the -- (inaudible) -- if you will, if they are off base projects, such as the one in Everett, Washington. Then, in essence, it's neutral in that regard.
REP. EDWARDS: The property will still, the actual land for example, is that still under the --
MR. GOODMAN: Yes, we have the authority to actually transfer the land in most of the -- in almost all of the cases I can think of. The way in which we're dealing with that is we provide a ground lease, but we are maintaining jurisdiction.
REP. EDWARDS: One thing you might want to do is look up the Deparment of Education codes just to be sure -- (inaudible) -- what you might end up doing in a number of cases is you're building a much larger quantity of housing units on post versus what has occurred in the past. This will be a tremendous help to the school districts around military -- (inaudible) -- and you might just double check them.
MR. GOODMAN: The representatives from the school communities have come in and talked to us about that because they were initially concerned about this. I think we have allayed their concerns, and they believe the program is, if anything, beneficial.
REP. EDWARDS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
REP. PACKARD: I think you've detected a concern, perhaps a lack, maybe that lack is not real, but certainly it's perceived by some of us on the committee, of a long term housing strategy, housing plan. That's probably the thing that concerns me most right now. I sense that we're moving into these whole new authorities and the privatization effort on a project by project basis, analyzing as we go into them as best we can.
But I have not sensed a standardized methodology or a standardized long term plan that would evaluate as we go along to see if we're going the right direction and if we need to make some changes. That I would appreciate you giving some thought to, I would appreciate maybe giving some response back to the committee on if in fact you're developing or have developed a standardized methodology for comparing, for instance, MILCON projects versus privatized projects. I think we would have some of our concerns allayed if we saw some of that planning done.
Then the long term plan, I would hope that you have a long term plan that would take all of your strategies for closing the gap into consideration, not only privatization, but all of the m. how many projects, how many homes you intend to build through privatization versus how many under the standard MILCON process. Those are some -- I guess I'm one that likes to see a well planned strategy especially if we're moving into a whole new area of unplowed ground.
I just would take a greater confidence in seeing how you mapped it out, how you plan to go back and evaluate the projects after they're finished, not necessarily before you go into them, but after they're finished to determine what we did wrong, what you would change, what should we change, what we can learn from experience, even bad experiences.
Because I do not expect everything to go smoothly in this process. I would be surprised if you expect that. There'll be some glitches, there'll be some unforeseen and unplanned for problems. There will be some bankruptcies, there will be some poor maintenance, there will be some nonperformance by the contractor that you're going to have to deal with. I sense that it's not going to go all smooth, and I would hope that we would do as best we can to plan for those eventualities beforehand, but certainly review each project to determine where we can improve, where we can avoid problems in the future.
I would hate to have as my legacy to this subcommittee, passing onto them 10 years from now a huge, humongous financial problem of how to deal with correcting problems that we didn't foresee as we move into this project. Because we're moving into it big time, and we're talking about big time real estate ventures. There's not very many real estate ventures in this country that will be as big time into this kind of activity as we are moving.
Even well thought out, well planned legalized contracts can go belly up, reverse and do the wrong thing. I would feel secure if you'd provide the committee with what you're doing, what you've done, what you plan on doing in terms of laying out a strategy, a methodology, a review, an analysis program that would start from the beginning to the aftermath. I'm not sure -- my sense is that we've not done enough in that, but we're so overwhelmed with the project by project approach that we may not be looking at the big picture that will keep us out of trouble.
MR. GOODMAN: Mr. Chairman, I think those are important questions, important guidelines. I think we need to do two things.
First, I think we need to provide you -- I like your characterization of project by project and overall housing plan. I agree with you that the department has not done the kind of job it needs to do in terms of laying out an overall housing plan.
That's one of the directions that Deputy Secretary Hamre has made. The services are working on it because I know that a combination, MILCON and privatization will need to work in conjunction. The project, for example at Robins (sp) Air Force base is one where the initial project that came to me was one that did a very good job of taking care of the senior grades and the young officers and the junior enlisted were left out in the cold. And I said that's simply unacceptable.
And what we worked out was a project where MILCON, we need to present this -- I'm probably a little ahead of the department because we need to present this to you, but where MILCON was going to insure that the houses were going to be adequate and appropriate for the junior enlisted, and the privatization would then be able to address some of these other needs so that we would address the entire needs of the installation and not leave that the junior enlisted in the cold. As much as I think we need to do a better job in our long term planning.
We've begun that in barracks, we need to do it in houses. I would go even further, Mr. Chairman, I think we need to do that for our overall facilities and installations and I've initiated a process to do that. It's broader and therefore it's harder, but it makes it no less important.
REP. PACKARD: I totally agree with you. On the underground facilities.
MR. GOODMAN: Yes, sir. But on the specific projects I think we have done a better job than we have thus far demonstrated to you. If you will, I think we have a far better analytical process, a far better, I think we have an established analytical process.
REP. PACKARD: Then you need to educate us.
MR. GOODMAN: I will take that as a test, Mr. Chairman. I think we have already instituted a lessons learned process, both in terms of how we're writing RFP's, what the issues are. I think you're right, there will be pitches along the way, and just as you don't want to leave as a legacy an enormous catastrophe for your successors, I don't want to leave from y successors, or worse yet be the person here at the table explaining why this occurred.
At the same point, I sure wouldn't want to be the person here from the department in 2010 explaining to the chairman of this subcommittee that unfortunately there just isn't enough money in our housing budget to take care of the housing needs of our young men and women, and we really think quality of life is important, and isn't it a shame. I think you've given us the tools that will enable us both to feel better in 2010 and I think we need to work with you to help insure that together as Congressman Edwards mentioned we can make this program very successful.
REP. PACKARD: Thank you very much. Do you have any further questions? I think you've said it well. I would like to leave a legacy where we solve the problem of housing in 10, 15 years from now and not a legacy of heartache. I don't want to close the hearing on a note of being overly cautious.
We encourage you to move forward. We're frankly pleased that you're moving in the direction that you're moving, but we simply feel that caution helps us do a better job of what our goal is, and we certainly -- we want to be informed as to what changes you're making in your plans and your programs, how they're working and we're not going to try to micromanage at the same time. We're certainly going to be interested in how you proceed, how you progress including your successes and failures.
MR. GOODMAN: Mr. Chairman, I take that as a task, I've told you the steps we are going to undertake. We will provide that information to you and I'm going to come back to you to give you more information about the ways in which we've addressed many of the concerns that you've laid out.
REP. PACKARD: The bells give us the signal to close this hearing. Thank you very much.
MR. GOODMAN: Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.
REP. PACKARD: We tried not to be harsh on you, but at the same time --
MR. GOODMAN: A lot of the questions that I knew you had beforehand led me to go back and take a look at this, and that's why I wanted to --
REP. PACKARD: I think you did very well in addressing our concerns, and now you'll want to make certain that you provide us every bit of information you can. Let us feel comfortable worth your long term plans.
