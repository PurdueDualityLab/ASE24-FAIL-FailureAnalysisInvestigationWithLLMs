MR. RAINES: Good afternoon. My name is Frank Raines. I'm the director of the Office of Management and Budget. With me are Aida Alvarez, who's the administrator of the Small Business Administration, and John Koskinen, assistant to the president, who is in charge of our government-wide year 2000 efforts.
We're here today to talk about the year 2000 problem and in particular its importance to small business. I'd like to start out, however, by describing the nature of the problem and also the efforts that we've undertaken within the federal government to deal with this problem.
The year 2000 problem comes with several names. Some refer to it as Y2K or the Millennium Bug. What it is, is actually quite simple, and that is, during the years when computer memory was quite expensive, the programmers, rather than writing out the entire year of 1962 or 1998, would instead just use the final two digits. And obviously that works very well until the first two digits change. And that -- those first two digits will change in the year 2000.
The concern is that when a computer is doing a comparison of years, whether it will read the '00 as being the year 2000, or will it read it as being the year 1900. Obviously, if you're trying to calculate financial matters or the difference in time, it is a very important distinction, that hundred-year variance. And it can cause a number of problems. Systems can either give very bad information, or they may just shut down because the information that they have is so illogical that the program cannot deal with it.
And it's not -- this is not just simply a problem in big computer systems and big computer centers. There are a number of things called embedded computer devices that are embedded in everything from toys to elevators. The example I like to use is with an elevator.
Very often, there is a maintenance program included in which the program will ask every day, 'How long has it been since I was serviced?' And it'll calculate from today to the last date it was serviced. If you get to the year 2000 and it believes that today is 1900, it'll calculate that it's been 99 years since the last time it was serviced and the elevators will shut down.
And if you multiply that kind of imbedded problem through all of the devices that exist in the economy, you can see that this is not just a problem for high-tech, big mainframe computers. This is a problem that ranges from the smallest appliance where the difficulty may simply be that you can't use that appliance all the way to major systems such as the air traffic control system.
It's not a situation that's entirely in the control of the users of the computers, as well. We might be able, for example, to fix the software in a computer, but find that we were relying on a vendor to fix the hardware. Recently, we were informed by a major hardware supplier that hardware we thought they were going to be upgrading, in fact they're not going to upgrade. And so we now have to replace the hardware because that -- it was not going to be done by -- by the vendor. So, there are enormous complexities that come from this problem, and because of the ubiquitous nature of computers throughout our economy, it's one that we are taking quite seriously.
In 1995 we created an interagency working group to begin working on this problem from the standpoint of the federal government and federal agencies. Soon thereafter, the president signed the Clinger- Cohen Act, which created chief information officers in the major federal agencies, and issued an executive order setting up a chief information officers' council, who began working on this problem.
In 1996, OMB together with the CIO council developed a five-part strategy to deal with the problem with federal agencies stressing awareness, assessment of the problem, renovation of existing systems, validation that the renovation has worked, and then implementation. And since the beginning of 1997, we've required agencies to give quarterly reports to OMB and we've assessed the -- each agency and how it's doing.
Agencies have identified almost 8,000 mission-critical systems that need to be examined. Of these 8,000, about 35 percent are now Year 2000-compliant; 45 percent are still being repaired, 14 percent are being replaced, and about 5 percent will simply be retired and no longer used. Now there is a lot of progress being made by agencies; however, we have identified at least six agencies out of 24 major agencies that are not making sufficient progress in solving the problem.
Our current estimates are that it'll cost the federal government $4.7 billion to deal with the year 2000 problem, but I do not hold that number out as being a final number. It has gone up every time we have calculated it, and I expect it's going to go up again. The more we get into the problem and identify the circumstances where it may exist, the higher our costs have become. And I expect those costs to go up as we approach the year 2000.
This is not just a problem for government, even though we are a major user of information technology. It's a problem for the private sector as well, and it's a concern of ours because they are our trading partners, but also because of the effect on the national economy. It's also a problem internationally. And we believe that in the United States, both government and business are making more progress than government and business abroad. And we believe that there needs to be additional efforts undertaken there.
Because of the size of this problem and the need to have a real administrative focus, we sought to sharpen our focus on the year 2000 problem. And the president, last month, issued an executive order establishing a new President's Council on the Year 2000 Conversion. And we sought out as the chair of the council and as assistant to the president, someone who we thought had the kind of experience necessary to deal with this issue.
John Koskinen has a long illustrious career in the private sector, having managed very large companies and in turnaround situations. He also served as the deputy director for Management at OMB and there has led our efforts to improve management within the federal government. And so we asked John if he would undertake the task of leading the government-wide year 2000 effort, and he agreed. And for that, we are enormously grateful.
Let me turn to John now to tell you a little bit about his perception in just his first several weeks on the job, and going forward what he views the agenda to be.
MR. KOSKINEN: Thank you, Frank.
I would like to take this opportunity to give you my perspective on where the President's Council on the Year 2000 Conversion is going and how we expect to operate, particularly how we are going to be working with the agencies to ensure that the federal government, not only is focused on its systems, but is reaching out, particularly to private-sector organizations both in the United States and abroad, to increase the awareness, and their awareness, of the year 2000 problem and to offer support.
Before I do that, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge Sally Katzen's role in this area. Sally knows the issue very well, having worked with -- closely with Frank at OMB over the past year and a half coordinating the government's and the agencies' response to the year 2000 and I'm delighted that as part of my coming back, Sally agreed to serve as the vice chair of the president's council to ensure continuity and to bring her expertise and experience to bear.
As Frank mentioned, the year 2000 problem is not a complicated technical problem. It is really an urgent management challenge, not only for the public sector but for the private sector as well. I am confident the council will play an important role in meeting that challenge. Within the government, the council will be a coordinator to ensure that the agencies are using their resources effectively to -- across agency boundaries as they deal with the problem.
However, we live in a world that is increasingly interconnected, where events taking place in foreign countries can have an immediate impact on lives here in the United States. Therefore, we have an obligation to the public to view this as more than just a federal systems problem. We need to adopt a global perspective, and I think the council's real contribution will be made by coordinating agency efforts to reach out to those outside the federal government, whether they be tribal, state and local governments, or foreign governments, private sector organizations, or other institutions operating around the world.
Increasingly, it's been made clear that people are looking to the federal government to play a leadership role on this issue. One of the most important ways in which we can lead is to actively reach out, particularly to the private sector, and organizations in the private sector, to increase awareness of the problem and to offer the support and the experience we've had thus far. We need to make sure that senior executives in organizations, whether they be fortune 500 companies or mom and pop grocery stores, are asking the right questions, which are: Do we have a problem; if we do, what is the nature of it; what should we be doing to fix it; and finally, are the organizations that we work with and depend upon prepared to work with us and to transition effortlessly and smoothly to the year 2000?
I have found that once that senior executives in an organization start to ask these questions, the work gets done. I believe that most senior executives in the federal agencies are, indeed, focused on this matter and the council's job is to work with them to encourage the leaders outside the government to ask these same questions. So, how do we do this? I think the most effective way will be for us to build upon existing structures and resources. I've spent much of my first three weeks on the job on what I've finally referred to as my 'agency of the day' tours, and during which I've been meeting with agency heads, not only to gauge their own agency's internal progress on the year 2000 problem, but to discuss the importance of their reaching out to organizations outside the federal government.
One of the things I've been stressing with the agencies is that they should not only be reaching out to their normal business partners, like state and local governments, with whom they work to operate many federal programs, but to private organizations as well, domestically and internationally, that fall within the policy areas of their concern. So for the Department of Health and Human Services, for example, that includes health care providers. For the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, it includes financial institutions. And for the Small Business Administration, we're talking about, obviously, small businesses.
The council is enlisting agencies to be sector coordinators for these and other areas of the economy, empowering them to determine the appropriate measures government should take to assure progress in these areas. Agencies may work through existing private sector organizations or other existing institutions in their outreach efforts. Senior executives in each agency overseeing the work in such sectors will be the agencies' representatives on the council, which will then be able to monitor, support and coordinate these agency activities and help ensure that there are not gaps in our coverage of this issue.
Of all the private sector organizations, small businesses are a special concern, because many of them do not have adequate information technology resources to devote to fixing the year 2000 problem. As you will soon see, my visit on the agency of the day tours with the Small Business Administration was among the most encouraging I've had thus far because here is a sector coordinator that really is doing great things in terms of outreach and has been doing them even before I showed up.
So to address the importance of the year 2000 problem to small businesses and her agency's role in reaching out to them, I'm delighted to introduce Aida Alvarez, the administration of the Small Business Administration.
MS. ALVAREZ: Thank you, John and Frank, for those kind words about the SBA. I'm glad that once you left with a little skip in your step as you left the SBA.
We've been working on it for a few years, John, which is we've anticipated. We have a very forward-thinking senior management team at the SBA and they anticipated this Y2K would be an issue not only for our agency but for our constituency. And as a result I think we've gone a long way to bringing our own agency into internal compliance. We've also been working closely with the banks and the other lending institutions who are our partners in SBA's portfolio of nearly $30 billion in guaranteed business loans to small businesses around the country.
And in fact, that number keeps growing of small businesses. We've counted about 23.5 million small businesses in the United States. And so, as we look ahead to assisting those small businesses, we've don't want to scare them because we actually think there is probably more readiness out there than we are aware of. But we want to give them some constructive assistance to make sure that, in fact that they are ready.
We are planning innovative measures to put this topic in front of every small-business owner in this country. And in developing our Y2K outreach strategy, we have reached out ourselves for advice and comments from a broad cross-section of knowledgeable computer industry professionals. Just this week alone, we held a very constructive focus group with major industry and small-business players to get their input on the issues.
And I really do want to thank Frank and Sally Katzen for focusing the attention of OMB on this complex issue, and indeed for focusing all of our attention on this issue and carrying out President Clinton's mandate and concern that the federal government take every necessary step to increase public awareness of Y2K and to offer the appropriate help.
There is no getting around it; Y2K is a problem that demands the attention of every computer-dependent small business in the country. But not every small company is vulnerable, even though it's probably a sizable part of that small-business community that depends day to day on the computer for their businesses.
Many of the smallest firms, those who have recently purchased hardware and off-the-shelf software, and whose computers are not linked in a network, may escape the so-called 'millennium bug.' We think that they're probably in good shape. That's because most computer manufacturers and software developers are addressing the problems of the Y2K code in their products.
But other small-business owners are not as fortunate. Companies with older computer systems or those with manufacturing, inventory and accounting systems who have 'inputted' information dated after January 1, 2000 -- where that input information has already been entered, they are at risk of the elevator problem, and they have got to take action to fix that problem.
How do you know if you have a problem? Well, of course, there are checklists available that allow you to assess your system. The answers on these checklists will help you to determine the extent of your vulnerability and whether or not you need to seek some help.
In a moment I want to show you how the SBA is doing everything we can through our web site to help small businesses. This morning I have three suggestions for every small-business owner. First of all, self-assessment. Figure out if you have a Y2K problem. No small- business owner should assume that he or she is free from the problem. Again, we don't want to alarm anyone, we don't want people to spend money unnecessarily on hiring consultants and the like, but I think everybody should take a good look at themselves and their business and make a self-assessment.
Number two, now is the time to take action, not later when it's too late. Fixing most Y2K problems is not particularly complicated. It can be, however, labor-intensive and time-consuming. The clock is ticking. We're all facing a deadline that cannot be moved. Last- minute fixes won't wash. You need time to test your system to assure that the fix you've installed is working. We want this to be a happy new year, not a new year where you're moaning about the bad things that will befall you when the clock strikes 12.
Businesses need to have compliance systems in place for a considerable period of time, such as a fiscal year, to ensure that the errors have been removed. No one has the luxury of time in facing this problem. Y2K does need to be at the top of your list, not the bottom of your to-do list.
Suggestion number three, be informed. Study the problem. Make realistic assessments based on what is central to your company's operations. Don't be stampeded into paying for remedies that you don't need. Logging on to various Internet Y2K sites is an excellent way to stay current.
If you aren't connected to the Internet, and many small-business owners are not, take a few minutes; sign up with an Internet service provider and get on-line. And that's what we're going to do right now.
We at the SBA are extremely proud of our Internet site. If you know anything about the SBA, you know that we are on-line in many ways; not just our home page, our U.S. Business Adviser, our on-line Women's Business Center, AceNet (sp), ProNet (sp), TradeNet (sp). You name it, we're on line. So we thought that certainly one way to help small business was to use our home page, our web site, to show them what they need to do to protect themselves and to take the necessary steps. Diane Gannon is here from SBA.
She's going to walk us through this -- I hope you can all see the screen.
The first thing you have to do, of course, is enter the address for our SBA home page, and that is 'www.sba.gov.' Now -- by the way, right now, we receive in excess of 3 million hits a week on this page. Now, you see the black Y2K icon just below the words U.S. Small Business Administration? It's kind of hard to see on a small screen, but if you click onto that, you'll see the SBA Y2K page.
Now, as you can see, we now have a countdown of days, hours, minutes, and even seconds to the year 2000. I -- I can't read it from here, Diane, but how many days is it?
MS. GANNON (Productivity enhancement staff, SBA): 604 days, 4 hours, 14 minutes, and 15 -- 14 seconds --
MS. ALVAREZ: And counting! Okay? So, you should get nervous when you look at this web page. How many --
MR. RAINES: I get nervous without even looking at the web page. (Laughter.)
MS. ALVAREZ: Right! Okay. And -- and, just in case you don't have a sense of humor, to the right of the countdown is an exploding computer. This is what will happen to your computer -- (laughing) -- if you don't take the necessary steps. And we're here to help you prevent that.
Let's arrow down to see the menu items. The first item is definition of the problem, and you'll see that red dot -- definition of the problem. And let's go to that. What you have here is, you can find out what the problem is, how it impacts small business to -- the everyday entities they depend on, for example, electric utilities. And here again, John, it's the issue you mentioned. It's not just your computers, it's those people that you interact with every single day that make the difference. For us, it might be lenders, the bankers, and companies that do a lot of our out-sourcing. For small businesses, you name it -- it could be electric utilities.
Now, if we go back to the main menu, you see, we have checklists to help small businesses to determine if they have a Y2K problem, and that's -- that's an important checklist. We have an overview of steps to take, and let's take a quick look at the steps to take. Diane, can you read that? MS. GANNON: The organizational commitment, create a plan, an action team, (remember ?) suppliers and providers, and do it all again.
MS. ALVAREZ: And again.
MS. GANNON: And have a contingency plan.
MS. ALVAREZ: And this is the way to get small businesses thinking in a logical sequence about what they need to do so that they'll be ready. Each of these items has a descriptive text underneath that contains recommended actions.
So if you click on to any of them, you'll get a more in-depth explanation of what it means or what needs to happen. Go back to the main menu.
Now, let's assume that a small business wants to find a solution provider in its own state. In other words, is there a company out there that can help me with my computer problems or concern? This is where our wonderful web site is so helpful, I think, because we've developed something called ProNet (sp). ProNet (sp) is SBA's procurement network. It currently lists around 177,000 small businesses. It shows their companies' profiles and their products and services. You know, originally we put this together so that we could help government contracting officers identify small businesses that should be involved in government procurement because, you know, the federal government spends maybe $200 billion a year. And we'd like to do a good percentage of that with small business. Now you can use that same list to solve your Y2K problem. So let's take a look at the ProNet (sp) search page.
Okay, there's a listing of the states, so if you want to identify a small business that's in your state, let's take a look at Virginia. We're going to highlight the state of Virginia and drop down to the capabilities keyword search area. And we'll type in the words 'Y2K'. So you drop down to the bottom of the database and submit the search. There you are, folks. I mean, wherever you may be located -- Springfield, Milton, Fairfax, Virginia Beach -- there's a business there for you that can help you identify whether you have a problem or not.
Let's now go back to the SBA's Y2K home page. And you can see that that's a really helpful service to have on your Internet, a lot easier than just turning to the Yellow Pages and wondering which of the hundreds of names in there are possibly relevant to your particular situation.
Okay, now here's another item that I think should be of interest. And this is our site called 'Major Corporations Get Ready For The Year 2000'. It's that interconnectedness that exists between government agencies, the private sector, big business, and small business. Small businesses very often depend heavily on computer software and hardware made by these major corporations. And you can see we've got quite an extensive list of major corporations.
And if you look behind any one of these -- and Diane, you're going to look -- we'll just randomly pick one -- Digital, for example -- you can look behind and discover whether or not these corporations and their equipment and software are Y2K-compliant, which will be very helpful in terms of knowing whether you need to take the next step, which would be maybe to call Small Business to help you with your problem.
I think you'll agree that this Web site can be very useful for small businesses. We want to -- we want the small businesses to make informed and intelligent choices. They need to learn about the problem and need to learn if their business is at risk. I mean, David Voight (sp) here -- is here from the U.S. Chamber, and I think he can tell us -- but we'd like to get the word out about this particular Web site and about the kinds of checklists of problems or sort of a diagnostic approach to this situation.
It is a manageable problem. SBA can point you to the resources that you need. Of course, we have an extensive network, as an agency, on the ground around the country. In addition to the Web site, we have a 1-800 number. We're going to be beating the bushes. Frank and John, you'll be happy to know we will not sleep, we will not rest until that midnight celebration -- (laughs) -- at which we'll know that all small businesses in this country are Y2K-compliant, and they've done their homework, and we've helped them to do that homework.
So please spread the word on what small business needs. We're here to help. Thank you very much.
MR. RAINES: Thank you.
Well, that's what we had to give as statements. If there are any questions, we'd be happy to take them.
Yes?
Q You mentioned the effort in the federal government to deal with this problem. The IRS, for example -- I mean, have they -- how are they addressing some of these concerns?
MR. RAINES: Let me let John speak specifically to the agency.
MR. KOSKINEN: Actually, the secretary of Treasury, Bob Rubin, and I were over earlier today at the command center that Treasury has set up to monitor there. They call it not a war room, but a command center to monitor the progress.
Treasury -- like a number of major agencies, it has a complicated challenge, because they've been in the middle of modernizing their systems, and their plan transcends the year 2000. So whether you're looking at Treasury or the Health Care Finance Administration or the FAA, a number of major agencies have been for some years moving forward to deal with this problem. So in the middle of it all, we've dropped the Y2K problem on them and said, 'While you're modernizing, you now have to solve this problem.' So in addition to trying to figure out how to do the fixes, what they have to do is make a set of management judgments of which systems that they're planning to replace will be successfully replaced before the year 2000, and which legacy systems, which ultimately we hope to discard, need to be repaired in the meantime.
And at this juncture I've met at some length with Secretary Rubin and his senior managers. They have pulled together not only a command center, but they've got the attention of all of the senior managers in the Treasury Department.
And I think that they are headed toward solving the Y2K aspects of their problem in the IRS effectively.
And it does not mean it's not without risks. It means that our assessment is now that they have identified the problems. They've put together the leadership team and the workers to deal with it. And as it goes forward, they should be able to meet the deadlines that OMB has provided; that they need to have those systems renovated, tested, validated and implemented by the end of March next year because, again, the relevance of that date is once the systems are implemented and up and running, you're still going to find continual minor glitches along the way.
So I think that the IRS is actually going to be in reasonably good shape in this regard.
Q Prime Minister Blair the other day, announced that the year 2000 that they -- (inaudible) -- (posing ?) a national emergency to the United Kingdom and announced they were spending over $200 million to hire 20,000 people to help fix, solve their problem.
You have all mentioned the importance of speed and public awareness. So I am wondering if you can assess for me how much the U.S. repair efforts are being slowed by the reliance on yourselves, rather than President Clinton or Vice President Gore to use the bully pulpit on this particular issue?
MR. RAINES: Historically, you know -- let me say a couple things about that.
The U.S. effort, I think, is actually one of the most advanced in the world, although we've got a lot of challenges. The president and the vice president actually have been quite involved in this effort.
I think it's about two months ago now, we had a Cabinet meeting in which both the president and the vice president gave a charge to the Cabinet to make this one of their top priorities in moving forward. The vice president then met with the President's Management Council, which is made up of the chief operating officers of each of the agencies, to give them a similar charge. And then the president moved forward with his executive order and the appointment of John.
And so I think we have got a great deal of management attention to this issue. And let me just state in a very summary fashion; this is a very serious problem. It is one that will require enormous effort in order to be successful. It is a problem that we think we can be successful on, but it is quite a large problem. And we want to motivate, not only the federal sector, but the state and local sector and the private sector, as well.
It is not a problem which we think that people should be dropping everything else they're doing and solely deal with this, but it is the number one information technology problem facing organizations in the U.S. and around the world. And I think, compared to any other information technology issue that I know of, the federal government is giving far more attention to this than anything else that I've ever seen.
Q Do you expect Vice President Gore or President Clinton to make a public statement on this issue?
MR. RAINES: I believe the vice president already has, and I think you will find them both making comments about it. The president does it quite spontaneously. Even though the vice president is thought of as being the computer jock among the two of them, the president actually I've heard spontaneously bring this up in more occasions. He did with the governors, and I think you'll see him do it in a number of places. He's on this issue. And I think you'll hear him speaking out quite frequently about the issue.
Q Just out of curiosity, are there any national security concerns related to this, in particular the nuclear force that the United States has?
MR. RAINES: Well, I think because of the high technology emphasis of both our national defense and our intelligence operations, you would expect that we would have year 2000 problems throughout -- you know, from the most common weapon to the most high-tech intelligence system; but also, we have an enormous amount of talent in those areas focusing on this question. I think you can rest assured that in the areas such as you mentioned, we're well on top of that and we don't anticipate there being any difficulties there.
The greater difficulties will come in the more ubiquitous systems that are available throughout that world, and we are giving an enormous amount of focus there, and a large amount of the cost that we're estimating is going to be in those sectors.
Q I have a question for Ms. Alvarez. You mentioned that many smaller companies will escape from this problem. Do you have any idea the percentage of those that can escape, or conversely, those that will be struck by it?
MS. ALVAREZ: Well, we know -- National Small Business United did a recent study in which they estimated that about 75 percent of all U.S. small businesses use computers. So I would say 25 percent might escape this if they're not using computers.
On the other hand, I have been advocating strongly that all small businesses should be computerized if they're going to be competitive.
Many small businesses really wouldn't have the expense of the major changes that a bigger operation would have. It's probably those that have been around for many more years that have more longevity that might have an older system. But I think small businesses in general have an awful lot of flexibility. That's why we think that it's good for us to get out up front right now, because they can probably address this with some flexibility. And including the list of the corporations is also helpful because I think they can also turn to the corporations that produce their hardware/software to address it.
MR. RAINES: Let me add --
Q Can you define what is a small business -- (off mike)?
MS. ALVAREZ: Well, for us, actually, a small business can be as large as 500. But in fact, at least 90 percent of our small businesses have five or fewer employees in this country. So they really truly are small businesses. And small business also includes self-employed individuals.
MR. RAINES: Let me add to that. One of the things we're trying to get everyone from federal agencies on down to focus on is the suppliers and vendors on which they depend. So even a small business that itself is not heavily computer-oriented and may not itself have systems problems needs to take the time to consider all of the people that they relate to. They need to talk to their banks about whether their banks are going to be able to provide services. They need to talk to their suppliers. Many of them use outside vendors to do their back office accounting or payrolling, and they should not be assuming that those companies automatically are going to be able to provide services in the year 2000.
So we are encouraging everyone to continue to reach out to the people they normally interact with or interface with, both to protect themselves, but also what we need to generate is an increasing level of awareness at all levels on this problem. And the more small- to medium-sized banks that hear from their customers questioning whether they're going to be up and running on January 1st or January 3rd 2000, the more comfortable we'll be that all of those institutions are paying appropriate attention to the problem. Yes.
Q For Director Raines on another subject, what sort of changes would the administration like to see in the transportation bill to make it acceptable?
MR. RAINES: Well, the president's indicated that the transportation bill pending in the House has authorization levels that we believe to be too high. They're $50 billion over the request by the president, $60 billion over the level in the balanced budget agreement last year. And so we have a concern about those levels.
Second, they're not offset. The spending is not offset by other reductions.
Although the bill says there will be offsets, none are identified. And so that's a concern.
Our third concern is that the bill is running a little bit out of phase. There's no budget resolution adopted by the House or the Congress. And to be committing such a large share of the total resources that we're going to have available before we know what the impacts it will have on education, training, on the environment, on health care, we believe to be unwise. And so we believe that the -- they need to pause and to consider how does this fit in the overall spending package that Congress is putting together.
The president proposed a 40 percent increase in overall transportation spending in his budget, and we believe that was quite large. This is dramatically higher than the president's levels. And we urge both the House and the Senate to pause and take a deep breath and consider how they're going to pay for this and how we're going to be able to meet the other priorities if they devote so much of the available resources to this priority.
Thank you very much.
