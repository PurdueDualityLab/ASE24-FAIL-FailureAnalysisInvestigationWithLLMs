POSTURE STATEMENT BY LIEUTENANT GENERAL RONALD R. BLANCK THE SURGEON GENERAL UNITED STATES ARMY FOR THE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE PERSONNEL SUBCOMMITTEE UNITED STATES SENTATE SECOND SESSION, 105TH CONGRESS HEALTH CARE 11 MARCH 1998 Introduction Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I am Lieutenant General Ronald R. Blanck, The Army Surgeon General. It is a privilege for me to address this committee. Today I would like to provide you with a picture of the Army Medical Department. Through this picture you will see an Army Medical Department fully integrated not only on any future field of battle, but in garrison as well, taking care of all our soldiers, retired and active -- and their family members. I will provide this picture in the context of the three Army Imperatives - Shaping the Force, Preparing the Force, and Responding to the Needs of our Army and the Nation. In so doing, I will highlight the issues and challenges that Army Medicine faces today and into the future. Next, as I know this is an area of intense concern for the Committee, I will focus my comments on current issues in TRICARE, and its ongoing implementation. Finally, I will take a few moments to complete the picture by sharing with you some 'Good News' stories from within the Command. At the conclusion of my testimony, I believe you will agree, today's Army Medical Department is more flexible and better prepared to meet all our diverse missions than ever before. I thank you for your continued support of our efforts to provide the finest quality of medical support to America's Army. Current Status of the Army Medical Department The Army Medical Department continues to respond with creativity and energy to the challenges of health care in a rapidly changing environment. Since the end of the Cold War, the Army Medical Department has reduced by about 20 percent in officers and about 40 percent in enlisted soldiers. In 1990, we had 168 field hospitals -- active and reserve -- that number has dropped to 52 and win continue to fall. In the same timeframe, the Army Medical Department began with 10 Medical Centers and 28 Medical Department Activities -- Community Hospitals--, our inpatient facilities, and has reduced to 8 Medical Centers, 18 Community Hospitals, and a host of large outpatient Medical Clinics. Even as we reduce our numbers, we are deploying all over the world more than we have in recent years. These deployments are not typically for combat, but rather for humanitarian assistance and stabifity and support operations. Medical personnel are finding that on these missions they are typically providing preventive medicine expertise and disease and environmental surveillance. All the while, we must maintain day-to-day health care for soldiers, retired soldiers and their families. Army leadership has articulated three imperatives as we approach the challenges of the 21st Century. We in the medical department must align ourselves with the rest of the Army to shape our forces to meet the needs of a changing world; we must also prepare our forces by staffing, equipping and training them to successfully complete all missions they may be called upon to perform; and we must respond to the needs of the Army and the Nation. Let's look at the Army Medical Department's current priorities, as they relate to these imperatives: SHAPE Drawdown. The Army Medical Department has been a full participant in the drawdown of the total Army Force. Reductions of 37.6% in the active Army Force have been mirrored by a drawdown of 34% in the Medical Department's military strength. We will continue to shape our force utilizing all of the Congressionally provided tools, striving to meet the allocated military endstrength in Fiscal Year 1999. These tools (Expanded Selective Early Retirement Authority, the Variable Separation Incentive Programs and the Variable Early Release and Retirement Program) have been applied selectively to the various competitive categories which comprise the Army Medical Department. The overriding consideration during this entire period has been to insure the correct specialty mix has been maintained to sustain the readiness of the Army Medical Department to accomplish its multifaceted mission. Leadership Development Opportunity. Historically, senior leadership positions and commands within the Army Medical Department (AMEDD) have been corps specific. As an example, Medical Treatment Facilities have been commanded by officers of the Medical Corps (MC) and non-deployed TOE medical units have been commanded by Medical Service Corps (MS) officers. Dental and Veterinary units have been commanded by Dental Corps and Veterinary Corps Officers respectively. As a result there have been few corps immaterial senior leadership or command opportunities for AMEDD officers. This policy has limited the AMEDD's ability to select the best-qualified officer for senior leadership positions. In January 1997 the Secretary of the Army approved The Surgeon General's request to change Army regulations which had restricted command of Medical Treatment Facilities. In general veterinary, dental, aviation, garrison and logistics commands will remain corps specific. Virtually all other commands will be AMEDD corps immaterial. The implementation of corps immaterial commands within the AMEDD will be phased in over the next few years. The FY 98 DA Command Designated Position List (CDPL) selection boards held in November 1997 for Lieutenant Colonel and January 1998 for Colonel was the first opportunity for AMEDD officers to compete for commands designated corps immaterial. Results of these boards are expected to be released in April/May 1998 for commands opening in the Summer of 1999, In addition The Army Medical Department has identified and opened appropriate non-command senior leadership positions to the best-qualified officers of each AMEDD Corps. Reserve Component Staffing. The Army depends heavily on its Reserve Component for medical support. About 70 percent of the Army's medical forces are in the Army Reserve --representing approximately 273 medical units. Several efforts over the past several years have improved some aspects of reserve readiness. For example, Medical Command and Reserve Command signed a Memorandum of Understanding that allowed closer interaction and support between reserve and active duty assets. Medical Command has also established Regional Medical Commands that are responsible for active/reserve integration in their respective geographical areas. Although these efforts have been successful in meeting their major objectives, we continue to have serious problems in other areas, most notably acute shortages of physicians and dentists in many reserve units. With a loss rate higher than our gains every year since Desert Storm, the current recruiting incentives are obviously not meeting the objectives of the force. It is a very complex set of challenges but we have already begun working on the following partial remedies: 1) increased emphasis with Recruiting Command on manpower needs, and 2) individualized efforts to convince physicians and dentists leaving active duty to join reserve units. Neither of these efforts alone will solve the problem, but if we do a good job in both areas, along with on-going restructuring, we can make significant inroads in eliminating the shortages. Dental Officer Shortages. We continue to have concern regarding the recruitment and retention of dental officers in the Army Dental Corps. Our budgeted end strength for dental officers is 1169, and on the 31st of January 1998 this year, we had 1018 in the Dental Corps, indicating that we are 13% understrength. We have not been able to meet our accession goals for the past 13 years. Additionally, the Dental Corps is an aging force. As of 23 February 1998, 17% of Dental Corps officers are retirement eligible and an additional 43% of current Dental Corps officers will be retirement eligible within 5 years. In response to this, Congress enacted a pay increase for both junior and senior officers, and an accession bonus and loan repayment program to enhance the recruiting of new officers. The National Defense Authorization Act of 1998 also provides for a Multiyear Retention Bonus for specialists. We are working to maintain the number of Health Professions Scholarship Program scholarships in dentistry and to obtain funding for specialists under the Multiyear Retention Bonus. We will continue to work in this area and monitor progress. Physician Assistant Shortages. Since 1992, the number of Physician Assistants leaving the Army has exceeded the number of accessions. This has resulted in insufficient numbers of Army Physician Assistants, hindering the provision of Army healthcare. There are a number of reasons for this problem and we are looking at several potential solutions. The solutions range from loan repayment for Physician Assistant School and recruitment bonuses to expanding the Green to Gold program and increasing the number of Physician Assistant Training seats. This problem is receiving a great deal of attention and I am confident we will overcome this critical shortage. Consolidate Regions. The Army Medical Department needs to align its organizations better in two ways. First, we will position ourselves around the deployable corps --XVIII Airborne Corps, III Corps and I Corps-- by really focusing on the needs of each of the warfighting Commanders in Chief. Also, we need to align ourselves and link ourselves better with TRICARE lead agents. They are increasingly important organizations for coordinating health care throughout the Army, Navy and Air Force, and to a certain extent the Public Health Service, in order to oversee managed-care support contracts. The Southwest Regional Medical Command consolidated with Great Plains Regional Medical Command last fall. The expanded Great Plains Regional Medical Command supports III Corps, and will focus on Southern Command. The Pacific Regional Medical Command and the Western Regional Medical Command have signed a Memorandum of Understanding defining their peacetime/wartime support of I Corps and Pacific Command,. particularly with regard to crossed lines of authority in Alaska. The North Atlantic Regional Medical Command and the Southeast Regional Medical Command are developing a Memorandum of Understanding as to how they will both support 18th Airborne Corps and share resources. Southeast Regional Medical Command will focus on Central Command and North Atlantic Regional Medical Command will align with the Europe Regional Medical Command to focus on European Command. These alignments should clarify regional responsibility and facilitate and improve habitual training and support relationships. Integration of Field Units into Fixed Facilities. The Army needs a certain number of rapidly deployable field hospitals that are fully staffed --except for professional fillers-- and able to deploy within 10 days. Other deployable hospitals, however, may be given 'Caretaker' status, with most personnel working day-to- day at fixed military hospitals. This helps maintain clinical skills and makes the best use of personnel to meet the daily demand for health care. Each Caretaker Hospital, with the staff working in the fixed facility, provides approximately $24 million worth of health care per year and is able to deploy in between 10 and 30 days. Reserve personnel will mobilize to staff the fixed hospital when its active personnel deploy with their Caretaker Hospital. TRICARE support contracts also provide for increasing the level of care/number of providers available during mobilization. Army Medical Command/Office of the Surgeon General One Staff. Last year we reduced duplication between the U.S. Army Medical Command Headquarters staff located mainly in San Antonio, Texas, and the Office of The Surgeon General staff located in the National Capital Area. This was not a downsizing exercise but a measure to improve performance by further flattening the organization and reducing duplication. It follows the dual- hatting of The Surgeon General as Commander of the U.S. Army Medical Command. The Deputy Surgeon General became the U.S. Army Medical Command's Chief of Staff. Three brigadier generals serve as Assistant Surgeons General in addition to having functional areas of responsibility within the Medical Command. Modem communication technology allows leaders in one location to communicate efficiently with their staff in another location. Medical Reengineering Initiative. The Medical Reengineering Initiative is the outcome of a process that examined the ten functional areas of Combat Health Support to ensure their relevance to future operations. It provides for a single, modular hospital and better command and control, with treatment teams and streamlined support elements. Potential manpower reductions generated as a result of MRI will be garnered as savings tinder the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) and the Total Army Analysis Processes. The Army Medical Department is an integral part of the Army, and as the Army reduces, so must its medical support. As a result of the QDR decision to reduce the Army from 495K to 480K, the MEDCOM will be reducing by about 800 military spaces. Some of this directed reduction will impact on health care providers and ancillary support. Although it is still assessing how best to execute its share of the QDR decrement, MEDCOM intends to premise its reduction on changes in workload and population served as much as possible. Critical to this analysis will be the protection of MEDCOM's core competency as a readiness focused health care enterprise. Army Medical Department Information Reengineering. A special study group called Task Force Mercury analyzed information management and information technology in the Army Medical Department, in order to best harness this critical resource. They delivered 27 recommendations for business-process changes pertaining to doctrine, training, leader development, organization, materiel and soldiers. Outcomes and efficiencies realized through these efforts include consolidation of seven organizations into one organization accountable for acquisition and support of information products, elimination of duplication across the organizations, and improved delineation of roles and responsibilities. Additionally, we are leveraging existing staff to address information requirements for both fixed and field operations. Customer support is now deployed far forward. Training of information management skills is now incorporated throughout all Army Medical Department curricula. A process for prioritization of business requirements has been established which will ultimately improve mechanisms for prioritization of corporate investments in information technology. These and other business process changes are anticipated to significantly improve the Army Medical Department's ability to exploit information and information technology across the full spectrum of operations. Reinvention. As evidence of the Army Medical Department's commitment to reshape and reinvent itself, the U.S. Army Medical Command requested and obtained designation as a Reinvention Center. Reinvention Centers and Laboratories are designated to lead the way and set the pace of change by experimenting with new processes and new ways of doing business. Although the Army Medical Department has been leading change for years, this designation affirms our commitment to innovation and making smart business decisions. In addition to the command's designation as a Reinvention Center, four subordinate units have been designated as reinvention laboratories (the U.S. Army Health Care System Support Activity, U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Prevention Medicine, and the U.S. Army Medical Department Activity at Fort Knox, Kentucky). PREPARE Readiness Training. Phased implementation of new standards to train all medical soldiers for combat support began October 1. These are not intended to revolutionize the substance of training, but rather to ensure wider understanding of requirements and greater consistency in implementation. The eight requirements are survival skills, weapons training --for selected personnel--, collective training, competency-based orientation, Deployable Medical Systems training, job-specific medical training, job-specific readiness training and a briefing on Medical Force Doctrine. A database in the Medical Occupational Data System will track these requirements. Battlefield Evacuation. Of critical importance to me is evacuating wounded soldiers from the battlefield to medical treatment facilities. Several initiatives, if successfully implemented, will upgrade our capabilities for this vital mission: The Air Force has agreed to support evacuation from forward hospitals to the rear, using C-130 transport aircraft as High Capacity Air Ambulances. Joint doctrine has been developed and will be included as a chapter in Field Manual 810-6. In FY 96 and FY 97, Congress funded the modification of eight -- 8-- UH60s to the UH-60Q air ambulance configuration. The cost of this modification is $2 million per airframe and allows for sophisticated medical treatment during evacuation. The UH-60Q provides advanced trauma management, enhanced navigation, communication and digitization on the battlefield. This enhancement gives the pilot situational awareness of his location and the enemies, and the capability to obtain and forward patient status information, beyond vital signs, to the receiving medical unit. The Army POM has program funding for procurement of 117 UH-60Qs to begin in FY 02 in support of our Force Package 1 requirements. Our procurement plan continues through FY 13 completing our Force Package 2 requirements, giving the Army a total of 184 UH-60Qs for battlefield evacuation. Until funding is available to purchase the remaining UH-60Qs, the Army is required to procure medical conversion kits necessary to convert the standard UH-60A to a UH-60A aeromedical evacuation platform. Although the conversion kit does not provide the sophisticated medical evacuation capabilities of the UH60Q, it does satisfy the interim requirement to provide for patient evacuation on the battlefield. A prototype of the new Armored Medical Treatment Vehicle performed magnificently during the Advanced Warfighting Experiment at Fort Irwin, CA., last spring. The Training and Doctrine Command has validated the Armored Medical Treatment Vehicle requirement. We are working on a plan that would allow us to begin procurement of the Armored Medical Treatment Vehicle beginning in FY00. TDA Specialty Response Teams. When Korean Air Flight 801 crashed in Guam last August, Tripler Army Medical Center had a critical care team in the air within hours to assist the Navy hospital in Guam. Shortly after, the Institute of Surgical Research at Brooke Army Medical Center had two teams of burn specialists flying to the site to provide care to casualties. We intend to form similar teams with special skills in trauma/critical care, chemical and biological casualties, stress management, telemedicine, and preventive medicine and disease surveillance. The teams will give us the capability to get two to four highly skilled care providers to a remote site rapidly, while larger support forces are mobilizing. These teams, primarily based in the Continental United States, are designed to respond to regional needs, often civilian, and are not designed to replace field units. Technology. We are enthusiastically incorporating advanced technology into the way we provide world-class care to our patients. The Personal Information Carrier is a device --card or tag-- carried on a person and used to electronically store data related to that person. The device is envisioned to hold personnel, finance and medical data, and for streamlining a variety of processes. The three services are currently working together to develop and test the Personal Information Carrier capability in the near future. This test is envisioned to lead to the deployment of Personal Information Carriers to the entire force in due time. Personal Status Monitors will allow us to know automatically when soldiers are in physical distress. The Warfighter Physiologic Status Monitor, a potential subsystem of Force NM Land Warrior, is composed of physiologic sensors and processors designed to provide assessment of medical status and casualty occurrence. This system is designed to interface with the combat medic allowing for far-forward triage and is being coordinated with other soldier monitoring programs. Telemedicine has been used to support several deployments. It is also being put to operational use in several of our fixed facilities. An overall strategy for fielding this technology is being developed by a General Officer Steering Committee supported by an integrated concept team --with representatives from academia, industry and the field-- sponsored by the Center for Health Education and Studies within the Army Medical Department Center and School. Other examples of promising technology include new advances in the development of synthetic blood or blood surrogates; vaccine development for a variety of infectious diseases; and our medical logisticians have effected significant improvements in managing our Class VIII supply system with the smart use of technology to reduce inventories, maintain total visibility of inventory, and track movements of supplies. Soldier Medical Readiness. The Medical Protection System, a medical Occupational Data System application, has been identified as the system to record, report and archive soldier and unit readiness. Implementation of the system is ongoing with immunization tracking being the first module to be completed. RESPOND This last imperative is where the medical department differs somewhat from the Army's line units, for we must not only respond to the call to battle in far-off lands, but we must also respond to the daily demand for high-quality, cost-efficient health care for soldiers, families and retirees. Operation Joint Guard. Army medical personnel are doing a magnificent job in Bosnia and Hungary supporting Operation Joint Guard. Their good work and aggressive health promotion have resulted in low rates of illness and injury. One particularly creative approach was the production of decks of playing cards that also contain tips to help troops avoid cold injuries, rodent and tick-borne diseases, and other preventable illnesses and injuries. Also in place in Bosnia, the U.S. Army Center operates a highly successful disease surveillance program for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine. The ability to collect and analyze, in theater, information on disease, and injury occurrence will permit early identification of threats to the health of the force and enable the timely use of preventive measures. We are learning how to use telemedicine more effectively. While visiting a Battalion Aid Station in Bosnia, I was impressed to see a physician assistant speak to, an emergency room physician in Landstuhl, Germany, using a satellite connection. It was simple, relatively inexpensive, portable and effective! TRICARE. TRICARE is the Department of Defense response to the Congressional mandate to develop a health care delivery system using the concepts of managed care while maintaining readiness, containing costs, and improving access to health care. TRICARE is an umbrella program bringing together the capabilities of the individual military Services, CHAMPUS, and civilian contractor preferred provider networks. I will speak to TRICARE in great detail later in my testimony. Health Promotion. One of the tenets of Managed Care directs that care is provided by the most medically appropriate, qualified provider to each patient at the right time and at the right place. In an ideal, efficient managed-care program, the appropriate level of care may well be lifestyle counseling and behavior modification to keep the beneficiary healthy to begin with, rather than waiting to cure an illness that could have been avoided. Again, I will focus more on this issue later. Ambulatory Data System. This new automation system captures diagnosis and procedure information on outpatient visits. The capturing of this more detailed clinical information is critical for decision making and to support our new costing methodology. Clinical Pathway Implementation. Variation is the enemy of quality. Clinical practice guidelines and clinical pathways are road maps used to reduce unwanted variation and to maximize the quality of care rendered. The use of clinical practice guidelines, the adaptation of locally specific clinical pathways, and the sharing of information will enable us to achieve our overall goals of improving clinical outcomes, conserving resources, and improving patient satisfaction. A database has been developed to track clinical pathways at Army Medical Treatment Facilities. Our Medical Treatment Facilities are now using 103 more clinical pathways than they were a year ago. More information about the issues discussed here can be reached through our new Army Medicine Web Site: http://www.armymedicine.army.mil.offcampus.lib.washington.edu We have to learn to manage change to our greatest advantage. The best way we can manage constant change is to be intellectually flexible while retaining an unchanging set of core values and functions. The core values of the Army Medical Department are: Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless-service, Honor, Integrity, r1ersonal Courage, Commitment, Competency, Candor, and Compassion with absolute patient focus. Our three core functions are: PROJECT a Healthy and Protected Force, DEPLOY the Medical Force, and MANAGE the Health Care of the Soldier, the Soldier's Family, and the Military Alumni Family If we can keep these values and functions as nonnegotiable guidelines, we will be able to adapt to the changes on the horizon. As long as we use our core values to guide changes to our core functions, we will be a wiser and more efficient organization than we have ever been in our 222-year history. TRICARE This morning I would like to provide you with the Army Medical Department's assessment of the TRICARE program. My overview will address how the TRICARE program supports the Army Medical Department's strategic goal of managing the health care given to our soldiers, their family members and our extended military alumni family. Through this overview you will receive an assessment of the progress occurring with the implementation of the TRICARE program, the challenges actively being worked, and the efforts ongoing to ensure the long-term success of the TRICARE program. As I present my comments please consider that the TRICARE program is a significant paradigm shift from how the Army Medical Department conducted business just a few years ago. For the TRICARE program to fully succeed every beneficiary must know how to access health care in this new managed care environment. Furthermore, every member of the Army Medical Department must understand their specific role so that cost effective quality care is provided at all time. As managed care continues to evolve in the private sector, we too are constantly working toward improving the Department of Defense managed care program, known as TRICARE. I anticipate we shall not see the full benefit of this program, both in terms of producing healthier military beneficiaries and generating further cost savings to our taxpayers, until this program is allowed to mature over the next several years. In 1994, an ambitious schedule was embarked on to stand up, nation wide, seven managed care support contracts in a span of four years. The Army Medical Department was given the honor of being the first Lead Agent to oversee the operation of a regional civilian managed care support contract. The first contract became operational in the delivery of health care services by March 1995. This occurred in the Northwestern United States. This first hand experience resulted in the development of over a hundred lessons learned, several of which were incorporated into the managed care support contracts that followed. Since the first contract, four separate managed care support contracts became operational within a two-year time frame. Again, the Army Medical Department, represented by three Lead Agents, is playing an integral role to the success of these contracts. The last two remaining contracts are scheduled to become operational in the Ohio Valley, the Northeast and the Mid Atlantic States in the near future, pending resolution of the ongoing protests. I anticipate that once these contracts are implemented across the nation, the understanding and acceptance of managed care principles by our military beneficiaries will improve. While the full impact of the TRICARE program is not yet realized, positive accomplishments are occurring in the Army Medical Department's military treatment facilities. Health Promotion One such achievement is the emphasis the TRICARE program places on health promotion. The Army Medical Department is aggressively pushing real health promotion and preventive measures such as education, behavior changes, and early disease detection. The U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine has developed a plan to implement a structured and consistent health promotion program, integrated with TRICARE, throughout the Medical Command. While investment in health promotion efforts are difficult to measure, five or ten years from now, there will be a payback in terms not only of resources saved, but more importantly, in terms of healthier patients who are more productive. Utilization Management The TRICARE program also places added emphasis on Utilization Management. This is another area of improvement for the Army Medical Department. Utilization Management assists us in ensuring that the appropriate amount of required medical interventions are provided without sacrificing the quality of that care. As resources decline, we must strive to minimize the provision of unneeded or inappropriate medical services. Since 1994, we have accomplished decreases in both our admission and bed day rates. While continued improvement in this area is needed, these changes have allowed several of our facilities to redirect their freed up resources to other needed health care services. The focus on Utilization Management is becoming so wide spread that it has even reached areas in the Northeast that have not yet implemented the TRICARE program. The North Atlantic Regional Medical Command, which represents thirteen medical treatment facilities in the Mid Atlantic and Northeast, reported for Fiscal Year 1997 decreases in Bed Day and Disposition rates of 20% and 21% respectively. At the same time they moved out with numerous new initiatives in such areas as, demand management, disease management, and outpatient levels of care. Specific initiatives include new, Advice Nurse Services; Health Promotion and Wellness Centers; formal discharge planning programs; disease-specific patient education programs, to name a few. The efforts in Utilization Management allowed the military treatment facilities in the North Atlantic Regional Medical Command to either consolidate or close twenty-one unneeded patient care areas. This Regional Medical Command is now focusing its attention on ensuring all memorandums of agreement between the new managed care support contractor and the individual military treatment facilities compliment the utilization management efforts already ongoing.. Performance Measurement With the TRICARE Program came the need for a more structured approach to measure the performance of our military treatment facilities. To meet this need, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs developed the Military Health System Performance report card. This report card strives to mirror the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set that is used by private sector employers to measure the performance of their commercial health plans. The Military Health System Performance report card is a standardized instrument, which examines five areas. These are access, quality, utilization, health behavior and health status. The Military Health System Performance report card results are derived from patient surveys and from automated data collection systems. The Military Health System Performance report card is a valuable tool that allows the Army Medical Department leadership to see how well our military treatment facilities are performing in meeting the needs of our beneficiary population. This standardized information is critical as it provides my commanders the ability to identify weaknesses that require corrective action. The outcome from these corrective actions is improvement in the delivery of health care to our beneficiaries. Recent surveys indicate that while there is gradual improvement across the Army Medical Department's military treatment facilities, continued work is still needed in specific areas. Customer satisfaction, in particular, is and will continue to be one of my priorities. It is important to provide quality care, which we do, but it is just as important that our customers perceive that they are receiving high-quality and compassionate care. While the TRICARE program has experienced some start-up glitches available survey data show it is working. Beneficiary satisfaction surveys show a large majority of customers are satisfied in those regions where the TRICARE program is already implemented. Department of Defense surveys show that almost 9 out of every 10 TRICARE enrollees will reenroll when the time comes. Despite this good news, there is much more work to do. While customer satisfaction with Army military treatment facilities improves, additional work must occur to raise the satisfaction levels for every beneficiary served. Hospitality Training Another initiative under development is a plan to implement hospitality training throughout the Army Medical Command. The implementation is currently on hold awaiting a response to our proposal from Health Affairs. The intent of this initiative is to improve the customer relation skills of all health care and administration staff throughout the Army Medical Department. This skill is critical due to the financial incentives inherent in enrollment based capitation funding that our military treatment facilities are operating under. Exceptional customer service will result in satisfied beneficiaries who will be more inclined to enroll in the TRICARE program at our military treatment facilities. Along with each enrollment come the funds to keep that 'customer' healthy. Access to Care With the TRICARE Program came, for the first time, system wide access standards to military health care. While these standards specifically apply to TRICARE Prime enrollees, all Army military treatment facilities are striving to meet these standards for every beneficiary they see. Access to military health care has historically been a problem area for the Army Medical Department. Beneficiary satisfaction surveys show that over 70% of those surveyed are satisfied with their access to appointments and appointment waiting time in our military treatment facilities. Still this means a sizable number of our beneficiaries are not satisfied with their level of access to care. To improve these access problems several Army military treatment facilities have completed or are pursuing restructuring initiatives. The goal of these initiatives is to improve their capability to receive primary care patients by increasing their primary care access portals. Darnall Army Community Hospital at Fort Hood, Texas, which historically receives low ratings in access, is one such example of a facility that restructured its primary care delivery system. We are now beginning to see positive results from these initiatives. The Army is also aggressively working to improve access to tertiary health care services . The Army is conducting several Telemedicine initiatives that are resulting in improved beneficiary access to tertiary health care services. Telemedicine Telemedicine is a technology to leverage efficiently the healthcare delivery over long distances. The aims of this technology are to improve quality, access, enhance provider and patient satisfaction, and reduce cost. The military has gathered substantial experience with Telemedicine both in the field and in our military treatment facilities. There are two applications of Telemedicine that have been very effective in the military; they are Tele-radiology and Tele-dermatology. Tele-dermatology is effective in improving access to the managed care, while decreasing the need for the patient to travel to a remote site for diagnosis of skin lesions. Tele-radiology is effective in improving the turnaround time to read radiographs and provides easier access for health care providers to read the films. This technology leads to quicker diagnosis of disease processes and improved quality of care to patients. The significant benefit these Telemedicine initiatives provide, from the beneficiaries' viewpoint, is improved convenience and access to these services. All of these previously mentioned initiatives are a sample of the various initiatives underway to continue to improve access to our beneficiaries. TRICARE Provider Networks The TRICARE program has improved beneficiary access in another important way. With the downsizing of the direct care system our overall capabilities have diminished. Despite this fact, we are able to offer our TRICARE enrollees the full spectrum of health care covered under the TRICARE benefit. The reason we can provide this benefit is because of our managed care support contractors' provider networks. These provider networks augment the capabilities in our military treatment facilities and give our beneficiaries the access to care they need, when they need it. The leadership within our Lead Agents and military treatment facilities know the health care needs of their beneficiaries and their capabilities to meet that need within their direct care facilities. In cooperation with the respective managed care support contractors the demand for services that cannot be met within our military facilities is provided to them. They use this information to determine the size and composition of their provider networks. TRICARE Challenges Despite the benefits the TRICARE program offers to our beneficiaries, there are still challenges that must be met and conquered. As I mentioned in my introduction, the TRICARE program is an evolving program that was implemented on a very aggressive timeline. Because of the speed with which the TRICARE program was implemented there are misunderstandings with the intent of the program and how it operates. Program Education One of the most significant challenges the Army Medical Department faces in educating all our customers, both internal and external on the TRICARE program. Our customers need to understand this program was developed to retain their choice of benefit plan, whether it be TRICARE Prime, Extra, or Standard and to also minimize their out-of-pocket costs. Some see the TRICARE program simply as the erosion of their military health care benefits. Those who believe this fail to see the true goal of the program. These skeptics fail to realize the larger out of pocket costs our beneficiaries would now be experiencing if TRICARE never came into being. Under such a scenario, many would find themselves with limited or no access to our remaining military treatment facilities. Their only option would be for them to use the traditional indemnity plan, known as CHAMPUS. While this option gives them greater freedom of choice, that choice would come at a far greater out of pocket cost than offered under TRICARE Prime and would not allow for significant consumer advantages available under TRICARE PRIME such as enhanced access, health and wellness benefits, and professional medical oversight by a personal Primary Care Manager. Educating all customers of the benefits of the TRICARE program is paramount to its success. The education effort must be three pronged to be effective. Our educational efforts must focus on all beneficiaries, the Army leadership, and everyone working within the Army Medical Department. Helping beneficiaries understand how TRICARE changes their health-care system is one of our priorities. The Army Medical Department is actively marketing TRICARE and working with Major Army Commands, as well as beneficiary organizations, to make sure that we are providing accurate information about TRICARE. We are incorporating TRICARE information classes into training school curriculum where appropriate. Videotapes, displays, pamphlets and briefings are also being presented. Our beneficiaries must understand that we aren't limiting their ability to access care, but expanding the choices available to them. If continuity of care and cost is paramount to them, then enrolling in TRICARE Prime in most cases is their best option. Those beneficiaries who want greater freedom of choice than TRICARE Prime, but still are somewhat concerned with costs, might be more satisfied with the TRICARE Extra option. If freedom of choice is their major determinant, regardless of the cost, then TRICARE Standard is the option they should choose. The Army leadership must continue to work with the Army Medical Department in getting the message out about the TRICARE program to all the troops, their families, and our retirees. Waiting until a beneficiary takes ill and needs medical attention to learn about the program is too late. That is like asking a Battalion Commander to go into battle without a operations order. Both situations are probably doomed to failure. Last, each and every individual, civilian and military, working in our military treatment facilities must fully understand the TRICARE program. These individuals are our ambassadors for the program. These individuals are closest to our patients and beneficiaries and can provide them with the needed advice to make an informed choice about which TRICARE option can best meet their specific healthcare needs. My staff is redoubling its efforts, in cooperation with the assistance of the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense, to ensure all our 'customers' are well informed about the TRICARE program. Command and Control of Managed Care Support Contractors The TRICARE program brings with it unique challenges in command and control of the managed care support contractors. Within the Army Medical Department, command and control remains strong, while the process with the managed care support contractor is less direct. Designated contract officers are the direct link to our managed care support contractors. To accomplish changes within the managed care support contracts my staff must diligently work through their respective Department of Defense Lead Agent. This situation can reduce the responsiveness of needed corrective actions. To offset this situation my staff and regional medical commands are developing closer ties with their respective lead agents to ensure issues requiring immediate action are taken without delay. Enrollment Accounting for TRICARE Prime enrollments, to include active duty personnel, takes on added financial importance in future years. In FY 99, the Prime enrollment numbers reported in the Defense Eligibility Enrollment System will be used for the distribution of Direct Health Program funds to our medical treatment facilities on a capitated basis. Efforts are underway to ensure our automated systems accurately capture Prime enrollment numbers. Financial Accountability With the TRICARE program came a more appropriate method of allocating funds to maintain the health of our beneficiaries. This new system is called enrollment-based capitation. The essence of this funding methodology mirrors the per member per month funding methodology prevalent in the private commercial sector. Just as the TRICARE program was a significant paradigm shift from our previous way of doing business, so is enrollment based capitation. Enrollment based capitation provides a set amount of funds based on the age and gender for each beneficiary who enrolls in TRICARE Prime at a military treatment facility. Regardless of the health care services the enrollee uses, with rare exceptions, no further reimbursement is provided to that military treatment facility. The focus of the medical staff is to keep the enrollee healthy and prevent the occurrence of long term and chronic conditions. Prior to enrollment based capitation, defense health program funds were allocated based on the workload generated at each military treatment facility. As more services were provided, more funds were allocated. This was similar to the fee for service reimbursement method used in the commercial private sector at the time. Obviously, such a funding method provides little incentive to improve the health status of our beneficiaries. This year is the transition year for all military treatment facilities to convert over to enrollment based capitation. Efforts are underway to reconfigure existing financial information systems to operate in a enrollment based capitation environment. The Corporate Executive Information System will also provide key reports to our facilities so they can succeed in this environment. Enrollment Based Capitation training has also been provided to our staff. The new Ambulatory Data System also captures diagnosis and procedure information on outpatient visits. The capturing of this more detailed clinical information is critical for decision making and will also support our new costing methodology. While I am confident that this new funding methodology is necessary, I expect some future adjustments and refinements to occur as this funding methodology is fully implemented in fiscal year 1999. The Future of TRICARE The future of TRICARE is bright, but not without further changes. As you are well aware refinements to this program are occurring. The Medicare Subvention Demonstration will be tested over the next three years. We are also in the process of providing TRICARE Prime to those active duty service members who are assigned to geographically remote areas. Efforts are also ongoing to craft the next generation of performance based TRICARE managed care support contracts that focus heavily on improving beneficiary satisfaction. All these changes are aimed at improving the TRICARE program and making the TRICARE, benefit universal to all eligible military beneficiaries. Medicare Subvention We have a moral obligation to allow those senior military retirees who wish to stay in the military health system that option. The Medicare Subvention demonstration that was approved by Congress last August gives the Department of Defense the opportunity to offer the TRICARE benefit option to our military retirees under TRICARE Senior plan. The Medicare Subvention Demonstration allows beneficiaries age 65 and older to participate in TRICARE Prime at selected sites. With this demonstration we are attempting to provide the services required by the Health Care Financing Administration for an At- Risk Health Maintenance Organization that is more cost effective than the private sector. If successful, the potential to expand the TRICARE Senior program to all military retirees will improve. Subject to the approval of our site applications from the Health Care Financing Administration, the Medicare Subvention Demonstration is projected to begin this summer. The Army Medical Department has four military treatment facilities participating in this demonstration. The four Army sites are, Madigan Army Medical Center at Tacoma, Washington, Brooke Army Medical Center, San Antonio, Texas, Reynolds Army Community Hospital at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and Evans Army Community Hospital at Colorado Spring, Colorado. Preparations are already underway to provide this expanded TRICARE benefit option to those military retirees selected to participate. TRICARE Prime Remote The TRICARE program has not completely fulfilled its pledge of providing a uniform benefit to all eligible beneficiaries. Service members stationed in geographical separated units are not always afforded the full benefits of the TRICARE Prime benefit. The goal of the TRICARE Prime Remote initiative is to rectify this situation. The TRICARE Prime Remote option provides active duty service members and their families assigned to Geographic Separated Units access to TRICARE Prime through the regional TRICARE Managed Care Support (MCS) contractor network. The contractor assigns active duty service members, and their family members who choose to enroll, to civilian network primary care managers. Active duty service members and their family members are eligible for the TRICARE Prime Remote Program if they live and work greater than 50 miles from a military treatment facility. The difficulty in providing these service members the full TRICARE Prime benefit dealt with the need to ensure medical oversight for any care rendered to them and the funding stream to pay for their care. Adjustments have been made to realign the supplemental care funds to care for these soldiers to our managed care support contractors and the establishment of a medical management oversight operation is being implemented. Once fully operational, all service members and their family members will be afforded the opportunity to participate in the TRICARE Prime Remote option if they choose. TRICARE 3.0 As we speak work is going on with the managed care support contracts for the year 2000. I am optimistic that many of the challenges identified with the first generation of contracts will be eliminated. First, this next generation of contracts will be performance based versus the prescriptive requirements that exist in our current contracts. By being performance based, contractors will have more flexibility to propose civilian best practices in their bids. This means our beneficiaries will be afforded in the next TRICARE contracts the most effective clinical and administrative processes known to date. I am extremely pleased with the heavy focus the TRICARE 3.0 contract places on improving beneficiary satisfaction. Built in financial incentives will ensure future managed care support contractors strive at all times to improve the satisfaction of their customers. This will be measured by Department of Defense approved beneficiary satisfaction surveys. I am also optimistic that the new financial mechanisms planned for in the TRICARE 3.0 contracts will be fully integrated with the enrollment based capitation methodology that our military treatment facilities will be working under. I anticipate major improvements in the ability of our local commanders to accurately determine the impact of their healthcare resource decisions real time. Unfortunately with the existing managed care contracts the lag time to identify the financial impact of local health care decisions is problematic. I am confident that many of the shortcomings identified in the first managed care support contracts will be rectified. My staff will accomplish an extensive review of the TRICARE 3.0 requirements to ensure existing shortcomings with our existing contracts are eliminated. The world is constantly changing, and so is health care in our nation. The TRICARE program is part of the evolution of our military health system. As the Army and the Army Medical Department changes with the incorporation of TRICARE, we will continue to focus on our core value of managing the health of every eligible military beneficiary so they receive the right level of care at the right time and in the right place. I ask for your continued support of the TRICARE program as it offers us the best way to provide quality care to our beneficiaries. With TRICARE we can maintain our position as a world class system capable of continuing Army Medicine's proud tradition of 'Caring Beyond the Call of Duty.' Good News Stories Finally, I would like to leave you with just a few of the many vignettes across the Command that highlight the diversity and successes of Army Medical Department missions. Just last month an Ohio infant suffering from botulism recovered rapidly after receiving an antitoxin developed by the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease. According to officials at Children's Hospital in Columbus, the 4 day old baby girl was admitted to the hospital and placed on a ventilator. Analysis of a stool sample confirmed the presence of botulinum toxin. On Friday, January 9', the U.S. Army Medical Materiel and Development Activity received a call from the California Department of Health Services, Infant Botulism Research Prevention Program, inquiring about using an Army Investigational New Drug product to treat a suspected case of infant botulism in Ohio. The U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases medical monitor for the Army's emergency treatment protocol was contacted and quickly consulted with the attending physician at Children's Hospital. After notifying the Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases arranged an overnight shipment of the Botulism Antitoxin. The first dose was administered at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Saturday. All regulatory procedures were followed. On Sunday, January 11th -- about eight hours after the second dose -- the infant showed the first clinical signs of improvement, beginning to move about and trying to breathe on her own. A couple of weeks ago the child was discharged from the hospital and on her way to recovery. This past fall, the American College of Surgeons reviewed and verified that Brooke Army Medical Center met its criteria as an Adult Level One Trauma Center. Subsequently, Brooke Army Medical Center was designated as an Adult Level One Trauma Center in the State of Texas trauma system. Brooke Army Medical Center is now the first and only designated Trauma Center in the Army Medical Department. Southeast Regional Medical Command's TRICARE Region Three has established a comprehensive, multi-level Breast Cancer Prevention, Detection, Education and Training Program. By using telecommunication technologies beneficiaries and providers across the Region have access to the latest information on breast cancer care - from their homes, their health care facility, the workplace and in the communities. A regional telecommunication network will be established, linking patients and providers throughout the region with the Breast Cancer Awareness and Solutions Center. Patients and providers can access the educational programs through interactive kiosks at the medical treatment facilities or through the World Wide Web via personal computers at the work site or in their homes. In June 1997, the Chief of Staff, U.S. European Command, LTG David L. Benton, III presented the U.S. Army Medical Materiel Center - Europe with the National Partnership for Reinvention of Government Hammer Award. The Hammer Award is Vice President Al Gore's special recognition to teams who have made significant contributions in support of the President's National Performance Review principles. Those principles are: putting customers first, cutting red tape, empowering employees and getting back to basics. The award recognizes new standards of excellence achieved by teams helping to reinvent government. To win the award, U.S. Army Medical Materiel Center - Europe, reengineered itself and the medical logistics system in the U.S. European Command area of operations. Medical materiel inventories were reduced throughout the theater while order-ship times improved from weeks to days. The U.S. Army Medical Materiel Center Europe was the first, and here to date, only Department of Defense organization in Europe to be so recognized. I would like to take a moment to describe a very innovative program called the AIM HI--Animals in the Military Helping Individuals--- Service Dog Training Center established at Fort Knox, Kentucky. The first of its kind, this unique program teaches inmates of the Fort Knox Regional Corrections Facility to train select stray and donated animals to assist physically disabled Exceptional Family Members and Veterans. Through the combined efforts of the Army Medical Command, Veterinary Command, and Fort Knox, this is the only Center that provides service dogs for the military community. This program has several goals and yields various benefits. Service dogs provide greater independence for recipients by retrieving and carrying items, turning on and off lights, pulling wheelchairs, alerting to certain sounds - literally opening doors for our people in need of assistance. This program benefits all involved, patients receive the assistance they so desperately need, inmates learn a trade, stray animals are saved from euthanasia, and medical expenses are reduced. Currently, there are eight inmates and fifteen dogs in various stages of training development. The center plans to graduate ten service dogs every six months. The world is constantly changing, as the Army and the Army Medical Department changes too, we will continue to focus on our core values and functions. We will maintain our position as a world class system capable of continuing Army Medicine's proud tradition of 'Caring Beyond the Call of Duty.' Once again, I appreciate the opportunity to appear before the Committee and shall be happy to answer any questions you may have.
