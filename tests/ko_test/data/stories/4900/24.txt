After a strong start, HUD could be falling behind in its preparation for computer compliance with the century date change, known as the year 2000 problem, according to officials from the General Accounting Office. Testifying before a recent House Banking Committee oversight hearing on the year 2000, or Y2K, problem, Joel Willemssen, director of civil agencies information systems at the GAO, warned that HUD was behind schedule in adapting its 20 mission critical computer systems to the year change. The problem for all public and private institutions stems from the inability of nearly all older computer systems to recognize the Year 2000. When older legacy systems were developed, computer memory was expensive. To save costs, software writers abbreviated the four-digit year date to two digits. However, as the calendar advances to Jan. 1, 2000, most systems will record the date as Jan. 1, 1900.
The date change poses huge problems for computer programmers, who must go through millions of computer code and manually alter the code to recognize the Year 2000. According to Willemssen, HUD's computer systems manage more than $400 billion in mortgage insurance and $460 billion in guarantees of mortgage-backed securities. "HUD officials recognize the importance of ensuring that its systems are Year 2000 compliant; system failures could interrupt the processing of applications for mortgage insurance, the payment of mortgage insurance claims, and the payment of rental assistance," Willemssen said. He noted that HUD has more than 200 separate computer systems, with more than 65 million lines of software code. The department's assessment of the extent of its Y2K vulnerability showed that more than 31 million lines of code will have to be repaired at an estimated cost of $48 million and 570,000 staff hours. While HUD was one of the few federal agencies to start work on the Y2K problem early, Willemssen said, the department is already behind schedule on renovations to 20 of the 30 mission-critical systems. "While delays on some of these systems are of only a few days, 13 of the 20 are experiencing delays of two months or more," Willemssen said. "This is significant because HUD is reporting that five of these 13 have 'failure dates'---the first date that a system will fail to recognize and process dates correctly---between Aug. 1, 1998, and Jan. 1, 1999," he said. For example, Willemssen cited HUD's system for processing lender claims on defaulted FHA single-family home loans, which is 75 days behind schedule for Y2K renovation. The system is not slated for completion until Nov. 4, only 58 days short of the failure date of Jan. 1, 1999, the date on which the system will crash. "In fiscal year 1997, this system processed, on average, a reported $354 million of lenders' claims each month for defaulted guaranteed loans," Willemssen said. "If this system fails, these lenders will not be paid on a timely basis." He pointed out that HUD officials have said that if more delays threaten important system deadlines, the department will postpone work on less critical systems to focus on the more important ones. "While HUD has attempted to mitigate its Year 2000 risks, several systems are behind schedule and actions must be taken to avoid widespread economic repercussions," Willemssen said. House Banking Committee Chairman Jim Leach, R-IA, said GAO officials have painted a rather different picture than the one presented by other federal officials, namely, John Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on the Year 2000 Conversion. Koskinen told the committee that "HUD is focused on the problem at the highest levels." "HUD is on schedule to meet the OMB governmentwide goals for ensuring that systems are year 2000 compliant," Koskinen said. "HUD has also begun to reach out to its business partners, which include mortgage companies, state and local public housing authorities, and the nation's cities, to increase awareness and offer assistance," he said. Leach told REFT that the GAO had told him prior to the hearing that it had a more positive assessment of HUD's Y2K efforts. "They [HUD] did an earlier job than most agencies and they get what appear to be very high marks. But I have a sense from the testimony today that they have not been able to meet their schedule, so there's a little more of a mix of opinion," Leach said. The congressman said he was not aware, prior to the hearing, that several of HUD's systems will fail well before the century's end. "That surprised me," Leach said. Ranking committee Democrat John LaFalce, D-NY, said, "HUD's critical housing programs, Treasury's central functions from bond markets to IRS, and the Federal Reserve and other financial institution regulators' responsibilities for banks, credit unions, and thrifts must not be interrupted because of massive computer failures."
