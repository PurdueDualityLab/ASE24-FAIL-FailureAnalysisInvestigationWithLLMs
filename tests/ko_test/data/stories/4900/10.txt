"The clock is ticking"for computer-reliant small businesses to prepare their computer systems for the year 2000 or risk lawsuits and business failures, Clinton administration officials warned Tuesday. Aida Alvarez, head of the U.S. Small Business Administration, staged an on-line computer demonstration at the White House to promote agency informational tools available to business owners on the World Wide Web.

Alvarez said the message to small business owners is, "You should get nervous."
