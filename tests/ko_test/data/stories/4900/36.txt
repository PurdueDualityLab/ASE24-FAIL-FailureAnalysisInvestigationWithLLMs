Testimony on the Office of Thrift Supervision's Preparedness in Addressing the Year 2000 Computer Problem before the Subcommittee on Financial Services and Technology of the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs United States Senate Ellen Seidman, Director Office of Thrift Supervision March 18, 1998 I. Introduction Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee, good morning and thank you for the invitation to discuss the Office of Thrift Supervision's preparedness in addressing the Year 2000 computer problem. As you stated at a hearing before the Subcommittee this past October, Mr. Chairman, 'the Year 2000 problem is more than a computer problem; it is a pervasive business issue for which there is no quick fix. Businesses rely on computer systems for nearly every aspect of their operations.' As you noted, 'virtually every business in this country will face a stream of potential direct and contingent liabilities based on the failures of their own systems or those of their business partners.' The Year 2000 problem is critical for financial institutions, which rely heavily -- and in many instances, virtually exclusively -- on computer systems to communicate sensitive financial and transactional data to and from customers and other institutions, as well as to process transactions and maintain customer information. The Office of Thrift Supervision ('OTS') has expended considerable resources on the Year 2000 issue. We have budgeted even more in the coming months to address the many different problems that both the industry and the agency must confront as the calendar turns. I want to thank Chairmen D'Amato and Bennett and the members of this Subcommittee for your continuing focus on addressing the Year 2000 computer challenges faced by the federal banking agencies and the financial institutions we regulate. Chairman Bennett and his staff have invested substantial time and effort on this issue, and their contributions to this important matter are much appreciated. I would also like to thank Chairman Bennett and Senator Dodd for their work in securing passage of H.R. 3116, which is particularly important to our continuing efforts to prepare the thrift industry for Year 2000 computer compliance. In my testimony today, I will first describe our internal Year 2000 compliance efforts. This includes an assessment of where we are with respect to our Year 2000 conversion efforts on our 15 mission critical systems, as well as our physical infrastructure systems. Next, I will discuss our efforts to ensure that our regulated institutions are taking the necessary steps to achieve Year 2000 compliance. This includes background on our efforts to educate our regulated thrifts on what they need to do to address the Year 2000 problem and to encourage them via our outreach efforts to take the necessary steps; our examination work to monitor thrift industry Year 2000 compliance efforts; our current thinking on enforcement actions that may be needed for institutions that fail to take the necessary steps to achieve Year 2000 compliance; and the current state of our contingency planning. Finally, I will respond to the specific issues raised by the General Accounting Office ('GAO') in connection with its assessment of the OTS's preparedness for the Year 2000. Before proceeding, I want to thank the GAO for their candor and assistance in helping us to identify the areas they believe we can improve upon in our Year 2000 efforts. They have provided many valuable insights. II. Internal Year 2000 Progress A. Mission Critical Systems In addition to monitoring industry efforts to address Year 2000 problems, the OTS is actively addressing the conversion of our internal systems. OTS program managers in charge of the various internal Year 2000 efforts report regularly to senior management and to me on their progress and pending issues. We have made substantial progress toward accomplishing our internal Year 2000 goals. In 1996, we completed an assessment of our national systems and developed a conversion plan to complete all coding efforts by the end of 1998. I am pleased to report that approximately 89 percent of necessary computer code modifications have been completed, tested and implemented. The OTS has fifteen mission critical national systems that support the key functions of the agency. Examples of our mission critical systems include the Thrift Financial System and Interest Rate Risk System that support the financial monitoring and risk management functions; the Examination Data and Corporate Structure systems that support the regulatory functions; and the Assessment Billing, Accounting and Payroll systems that support the administrative function of the agency. Thirteen of these systems have been renovated and implemented with the Year 2000 changes. Modifications to the remaining two are scheduled to be completed by November of 1998. We began validation testing of converted systems in September f997, at our disaster recovery site. For three days, the renovated systems operated under dates ranging from December 31, 1999 to June 1, 2000. This validated the date rollover from December 1999 to January 2000 and also enabled us to test leap year items and quarterly process functions. The tests were successful, identifying only a few small, but easily correctable problems that have been addressed. The final step in our process to make our mission critical systems Year 2000 compliant involves contingency planning to address the situation if, despite our expectations, one or more of our systems experience a Year 2000 failure. We expect to complete a contingency plan for addressing this possibility by mid-year 1998. A necessary part of this effort involves incorporating any problems we have identified so far during validation testing. Thus, feedback from our validation testing will be a critical component in structuring our contingency planning efforts. We believe that our plan will be more comprehensive, and that we will be better prepared by having the benefit of these test results before proceeding. The plan will address each mission critical system and include special testing procedures and support requirements for the century date change. In addition to work on our mission critical systems, another significant Year 2000 compliance effort involves working with the third-party vendor that provides us with electronic filing software used by our regulated institutions for financial reporting purposes. Since this requires a reliable interface between the agency and the regulated institutions, this is an important aspect of our ability to receive financial data from these institutions. Currently, we are working with the software vendor to ensure that the software is Year 2000 compliant for the industry's 1998 reporting cycles. The testing has been completed and the new software is scheduled to be mailed to the industry by March 20, 1998. B. Infrastructure Another important aspect of our internal Year 2000 compliance efforts involves identifying and fixing the various parts of our physical infrastructure that must be made Year 2000 compliant. Infrastructure issues were identified by using a checklist provided initially by the Treasury Department, as well as thorough physical inspection of Washington and regional offices to determine any equipment or systems that were not included as part of that checklist. Using the resulting list of items and systems, we have identified equipment and systems as being non- Year 2000 compliant. Examples of items found to be non-compliant include some telephone and voice mail systems, a security card access system, a postage scale and a few fax machines. All items, with the exception of the fax machines are scheduled for modification during 1998. The fax machines are scheduled for replacement in 1999. In addition, 100 percent of our Washington building systems, including elevators, heating and air conditioning controls, emergency systems, and electrical distribution systems have been identified by their manufacturers to be Year 2000 compliant. Actual testing of all systems, including those identified as Year 2000 compliant by their manufacturer, will occur throughout 1998. C. Year 2000 Costs for OTS Systems and Infrastructure We have estimated that the total costs that will be incurred in connection with ensuring that our mission critical and related systems and our physical infrastructure are Year 2000 compliant will be approximately $1,290,000. Of this amount, approximately $899,000 has already been spent, with another $391,000 budgeted for fiscal year 1998 through 2000. In the event that actual costs exceed our projected outlays, we believe we have sufficient funds available to cover any shortfall in our estimates. III. Industry Activities A. Education and Encouragement Our first formal effort to enhance industry awareness about Year 2000 issues began in the summer of 1996 when the OTS, along with the other financial institution regulators represented on the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council ('FFIEC'), sent the banking, thrift and credit union industries a statement alerting them to computer system risks that may arise from the calendar year 1999 rollover into the next century. The FFIEC statement stressed the need for early, careful planning by institution management to develop an action plan for identifying Year 2000 issues and implementing programs to effectuate Year 2000 compliance in a timely manner. It also included guidelines for financial institutions to follow in their efforts to ensure that computer systems will function properly and without disruption when the calendar rolls over to the next millennium. In May 1997, the FFIEC agencies sent a follow-up industry advisory highlighting the need for institutions to make all information processing systems Year 2000 compliant and specifically identifying concerns that should be considered in managing a Year 2000 project plan. The statement provided an outline of the Year 2000 project management process, an identification of external risk issues that a Year 2000 project plan should consider, other operational issues that may be relevant to Year 2000 planning, and a description of the supervisory strategy that would be followed by the federal banking agencies. In December 1997, the OTS and the other FFIEC agencies sent out additional safety and soundness guidelines that focused primarily on Year 2000 business risks. This guidance emphasized that the preparation for Year 2000 is more than a computer system issue. It is an enterprise-wide challenge that must be addressed at the highest levels of management. The advisory established specific expectations for senior management and the board of directors of financial institutions for addressing the business risks associated with the Year 2000 problem. This week, the OTS and the other FFIEC agencies are issuing guidance to address two potential areas of Year 2000 exposure for financial institutions-risks posed by service providers and software vendors, and risks from customers of financial institutions, including funds providers. The guidance relating to,service providers and software vendors encourages financial institutions to develop a due diligence process. That process includes identifying mission critical services and products provided by these entities, monitoring procedures to verify that these entities are taking appropriate Year 2000 actions, establishing contingency plans, and testing services and products. The guidance further stresses that financial institutions should require well-defined objectives, testing approaches, and testing schedules from these entities. It also encourages management to join forces and coordinate group efforts to evaluate the performance and testing methodologies of service providers and software vendors, to participate in testing efforts to the extent possible, and to evaluate contingency plans. These joint efforts may help financial institutions more effectively solicit information and demand performance from service providers and software vendors. In cases where financial institutions encounter difficulties with their service providers and software vendors, they are advised to report these problems to their primary federal regulatory agency. The customer risk guidance helps financial institutions develop a process to identify material customers, evaluate their Year 2000 preparedness, assess their Year 2000 credit risks, and implement controls to manage any risk exposure. The guidance recognizes that this process will vary on a case-by-case basis depending on the size of the institution and the size and technological sophistication of its customers. The guidance includes sample forms and questionnaires to assist financial institutions in evaluating and monitoring the Year 2000 preparedness of their customers. The FFIEC agencies are also in the process of drafting additional advisories and expect to issue testing guidance in the next few weeks, and contingency planning guidance toward the end of April. As each of these FFIEC advisories is released, the OTS transmits them to the industry. We highlight the contents of the advisory and reinforce our commitment to oversee the industry's Year 2000 preparations and compliance efforts. In addition, our regional offices have supplemented the national letters with supervisory notices and bulletins of their own, and have distributed copies of the Federal Reserve Board's Year 2000 Awareness videotape to each OTS-regulated thrift. The OTS, both in conjunction with the other FFIEC agencies and on its own, has taken every opportunity to speak directly with the thrift industry and its service providers about the Year 2000 issue. For example, in May 1997, our Northeast Region held a Year 2000 symposium that attracted over 100 thrift institution representatives and 29 service providers. On November 10, 1997, the FFIEC sponsored a conference, in which about 40 service providers participated, to establish an ongoing dialogue on Year 2000 related issues and to communicate agency expectations to data processing and software providers. On January 13, 1998, the FFIEC agencies sponsored their third interagency Year 2000 meeting with about a dozen financial institution trade associations and one service provider trade association. All of these efforts have addressed the needs of financial institutions in their efforts to become Year 2000 compliant. In addition, since being sworn in as Director of the OTS less than five months ago, I have given at least 20 speeches-to both large and small groups of thrift executives-that have emphasized the Year 2000 problem. In numerous press interviews, I have also continually stressed the importance of the Year 2000 issue. Similarly, my staff has been very outspoken on the Year 2000 problem. Since September of last year, Washington and regional staff have given over 40 presentations on Year 2000 issues at meetings and conferences with thrifts and industry groups. Looking forward, on June 2, 1998, our Northeast regional office will host a symposium in New York City entitled 'Facing the Year 2000 Challenge Together.' The region will build on the success of its prior symposium held in May 1997 by reinforcing the assessment, inventory and conversion/renovation stages of the Year 2000 process and, most importantly, featuring timely information on the critical testing phase and contingency planning process. We are very pleased that Mr. John Koskinen, Assistant to the President and Chair of the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion, will be the keynote speaker. Other program participants will include a member of the Senate Banking Committee staff, select financial institution representatives who are making progress towards Year 2000 compliance, and data processing service providers. We expect about 200 CEOs and CIOs of banks and thrift institutions located in the Northeast to attend. We will be videotaping the conference and making copies available to financial institutions, service providers, software providers, our other regional offices, and other agencies. We are also exploring the possibility of linking other locations in the country to the symposium via teleconferencing. We are also working closely with industry trade associations that are coordinating conferences on Year 2000 issues and facilitating communications within the financial institutions industry as a whole. The OTS, in cooperation with the FDIC and America's Community Bankers ('ACB') presented three Year 2000 conferences to approximately 400 of ACB's member institutions in February and March in Los Angeles, Chicago, and in Washington, D.C. The conferences, entitled 'Countdown 2000: Is Your Bank Ready?' included presentations by OTS officials on business risk, examination issues, testing, and contingency planning. Also in March, the OTS will discuss how the regulators are preparing for the Year 2000 at a conference sponsored by the Association for Financial Technology. During May, the OTS and the other FFIEC agencies, in cooperation with industry trade associations will conduct five 'vendor' conferences around the country. These conferences will emphasize to vendors the agencies' expectations for Year 2000 compliance. In August 1997, the OTS added a Year 2000 page to its web site. The Year 2000 page includes an electronic checklist that helps institution management monitor internal progress toward completing a Year 2000 renovation project. We have received feedback from service providers and institution management indicating that this is a useful management tool. We have already made one major revision to the checklist and will continue to devote our information services resources to keep the checklist current with the best practices of the industry as those emerge. We have developed a new product called 'Prudent Practices for Y2K Testing' that will be added to our web site shortly. The page also includes links to the FFIEC web site where the FFIEC Year 2000 advisory statements and other relevant information and links are maintained. The OTS is also publishing a monthly newsletter devoted to Year 2000 issues. The first edition of the newsletter, which is called 'Millennium,' was released to the thrift industry in January of this year. Copies of the January and February editions are attached to this statement. We adopted the newsletter approach to provide another way to keep the industry aware of Year 2000 issues and to urge the industry proactively to address potential problems. It also provides the industry with insight into what the OTS is doing to address the Year 2000 problem, and encourages a more open dialogue with our institutions so that we can do even more to help them address problems. The OTS's Year 2000 Working Group will continue to work internally, with the FFIEC agencies and with other government agencies, to assess whether there are additional issues or other matters requiring guidance to the industry and the best means for delivering the needed information. B. Examination Efforts The most important aspect of our Year 2000 work is examining the institutions we regulate to determine and evaluate their progress. Our initial round of examinations coincided with the 'Awareness' and 'Assessment' phases of the FFIEC's 5-phase program guidelines for Year 2000 compliance set forth in its May 1997 policy statement. To evaluate each institution's exposure to Year 2000 risks and its strategy for managing those risks, the OTS performed 1,211 supplemental off-site compliance examinations between May and November 1997. In conducting these examinations, our regional offices sent each thrift institution a supplemental examination program and requested responses by September 30, 1997. Examiners carefully reviewed the responses to ascertain the degree of industry awareness of potential Year 2000 rollover problems and the adequacy of institution planning for renovation, testing and implementation. The depth and detail of the requested information far surpassed that called for by the FFIEC procedures. OTS examiners then conducted follow-up inquiries, as necessary, of institutions that either provided insufficient data or appeared particularly unaware of, or unprepared to address, Year 2000 compliance issues. Upon completion of the follow-up inquiries, we prepared a Report of Examination or letter for the board of directors of each institution, and entered key elements and conclusions from the examinations into a national database. Results from the initial off-site assessment examinations conducted in 1997 were encouraging. They showed that the thrift industry generally was aware of and addressing the potential impact of the Year 2000 calendar rollover. For example, 94 percent of thrifts had then assigned Year 2000 oversight duties to a senior officer or committee and 90 percent of thrifts were developing a Year 2000 Action Plan. Based on the information thrift managers provided, OTS examiners rated 85 percent of thrifts as having average-or-better awareness and average-or- better commitment to resolution. Also encouraging was the finding that conversion efforts, including those by those thrifts that are also considered service providers, were well underway for 45 percent of the industry. At a few thrifts (1 percent of the industry) that started their Year 2000 projects early, renovation efforts were essentially complete, subject only to additional testing of various interfaces with other parties. Nonetheless, there were concerns at 15 percent of the thrifts regulated by the OTS, primarily the absence of Action Plans and reliance on vendors that was not buttressed by due diligence efforts. Other common concerns for these thrifts and for those assigned an 'average risk' rating were incomplete Action Plans; inadequate planning for testing; and the absence of contingency planning. In addition, often the assessment of other items that can be adversely affected by the calendar year rollover, such as telephones and environmental controls (HVAC), was planned for the near future but had not yet started. The examiners also noted some lack of understanding about interfaces and about credit risk. Finally, even for those serviced institutions attempting due diligence, information obtained to date from vendors did not always provide sufficient information about renovation approaches and testing opportunities and plans. One of our findings from these examinations paralleled a common finding of other agencies and trade groups. That is, in general, Year 2000 matters had not been addressed as aggressively by smaller thrifts as they have been by larger ones. There are some small and medium-sized thrifts with excellent Year 2000 Action Plans and some large thrifts with Year 2000 efforts lagging in one or more respects. But a relatively larger percentage of smaller thrifts (than larger thrifts) had yet to demonstrate a vigorous approach to Year 2000 oversight and remediation. We are now well into our second round of Year 2000 compliance examinations, which coincides with the 'Renovation' phase of the Year 2000 project management plan noted in the FFIEC's May 1997 policy statement. We have instructed our regional offices to commence the last of these examinations no later than mid-June 1998. Examination reports will be written, reviewed, and transmitted to the institutions as soon as practicable after completion of each examination conducted during this second round of examinations. Institutions identified in the first round of supplemental assessment examinations as lagging in their Year 2000 awareness and assessment were queued up early in the second round examinations so that, if needed, examiners could return for further field visits or examinations by July 1, 1998. This second round of examinations will help us better assess each institution's actual renovation track record and prospects for timely completion of their Year 2000 renovation efforts. This will help us prioritize later rounds of Year 2000 examinations that will focus on testing and implementation of Year 2000-ready applications. In conducting these examinations, our examiners are using the Year 2000 examination procedures enclosed with the May 1997 FFIEC policy statement to establish a consistent starting point for the on-site review of each institution. As these examinations proceed, our examiners have been directed to supplement the FFIEC procedures with steps designed to respond to specific fact circumstances as their initial findings are developed and the level of risk at a particular institution becomes more apparent. For example, the first step in the FFIEC program calls for the examiner to ' d etermine the organization's source of information systems support for hardware ... and related applications and operating system software. Note whether information systems processing is provided internally, externally, or a combination of both.' The information obtained by the examiner is cross- checked to our national IS databases and in the examination workpapers. These databases help us respond more quickly and effectively as problems surface with particular vendors or application types. OTS requires its examiners to complete two steps that are not part of the FFIEC program-to review recent reports of examination on the thrift's vendors and to complete a 39-question Internal Assessment Survey. Responses are entered into a national database which is used to monitor Year 2000 conditions in the thrift industry and to respond to inquiries from members of Congress and others. The database information also helps us identify problem areas. We address those problems by adjusting our examination efforts and by discussing the concerns in presentations to industry and trade groups and in our Year 2000 newsletter. The database may also reveal areas where thrift management needs additional clarification or guidance which can then be addressed by OTS either separately or with the other FFIEC agencies. Among other things, the Internal Assessment Survey requires OTS examiners to rate Year 2000 'Awareness,' 'Assessment,' 'Contingency Planning,' 'Renovation,' 'Testing Plan,' 'Testing Progress,' 'Implementation Plan' and 'Implementation Progress.' Examiners must also complete a section on 'Mission-Critical Items' and identify specific mission-critical items (eg., hardware, operating systems, applications, etc.) where renovation progress is lacking. Although the FFIEC program does not explicitly require an examiner to assess each phase of an institution's Year 2000 Project Management, the examiner must take that approach in order to complete the Internal Assessment Survey questions and to prepare a Year 2000 Report of Examination (ROE). The ROE must present the examiner's findings-good, bad or indifferent- regarding the 5 phases and must also address problems noted under 10 different areas (e. R., Reliance on Vendors, Data Exchange, etc.). Instructions for the ROE provide additional guidance and questions which supplement the FFIEC examination program. Since November 1, 1997, we have commenced on-site Year 2000 examinations at 337 thrift institutions. Although these examinations involve just 28 percent of the population of thrifts we regulate, we are on target with our examination scheduling plan. Our regional offices intentionally scheduled most of these examinations as late in the second cycle as possible to allow time for additional staff training after the completion of our initial off-site examinations. Moreover, examinations conducted further into the 'renovation' phase will likely produce more realistic, meaningful and conclusive findings. Last Friday we sent additional Year 2000 guidance to our regional offices to assist them with their second round of examinations. This material includes not only examination report templates, but also a rating system for evaluating Year 2000 progress, and specific detail on data collection, supervisory follow-up, and enforcement actions. We shared with our GAO evaluators drafts of this package as it was being developed and asked for their thoughts and comments, particularly with respect to any supplemental items that they believed might enhance our examination procedures and improve our industry oversight efforts. Unfortunately, our GAO evaluators were not able to provide us with any feedback. We will consider sending our regional offices a revised, supplemental package that incorporates comments that the GAO may eventually offer to us. Second round Year 2000 examinations results are still being reviewed by regional staff to ensure the appropriateness and consistency of assigned ratings. For the examinations that have been finalized, we are seeing some slippage in our ratings. While our initial findings in the fall of 1997 indicated concerns at 15 percent of the institutions we regulate, 22 percent of the first 199 institutions rated in the current round had a 'Needs Improvement' rating assigned and another I percent was categorized as 'Unsatisfactory.' Status reports from our regional offices regarding examinations in progress suggest the possibility of further slippage. One reason for the decline in ratings noted to date, and expected in the near-term, is that we used the results of the initial supplemental examinations to prioritize the second round of examinations. Not all of the institutions examined for Year 2000 between November and now exhibited weaknesses in the fall of 1997. Nonetheless, early second round findings are likely biased by the fact that the pool of institutions includes a disproportionately large percentage of thrifts where weaknesses had already been detected. Concerns noted in this round include the fact that some thrifts that are primarily reliant on data service providers had made little progress in finalizing an action plan that would provide the appropriate framework to monitor the servicer's efforts as well as efforts by thrift personnel regarding in-house items. Another common concern was that institutions had not completed the assessment of their infrastructure. Findings from a sample of examination reports from the 77 percent of the thrifts where the examiners assigned 'Satisfactory' Year 2000 ratings show those thrifts are actively monitoring their data service providers and that those servicers are reporting satisfactory progress in renovating and testing mission critical applications they maintain for the thrifts. Thrift managers for these shops typically have ascertained how and when their service providers will allow clients to perform their part of testing. The target dates are generally in compliance with the .FFIEC guidance in some cases, the target dates for renovation, testing and implementation are substantially in advance of the FFIEC dates, leaving a cushion which would be available should problems surface in testing or implementation. Nonetheless, for some of these thrifts, the examiners are making recommendations for further improvement. Most commonly, these recommendations pertain to contingency planning and testing strategies. Regarding the former, the thrifts need to move beyond exploring the possibilities for alternate service providers should their main service provider not be able to complete renovation and testing before critical dates are reached. They also need to expand their contingency plans to cover other potential problems that could surface during testing and implementation. As noted earlier, the FFIEC will be issuing additional guidance on contingency planning and testing. In our efforts to marshal our examination resources to address the Year 2000 problem, each of our regional offices identified and trained a team of safety and soundness ('S&S') examiners to concentrate solely on Year 2000 work. This special group of 84 examiners, which represents almost 20 percent of our S&S examination staff, will work with our 24 Information System ('IS') examiners and managers to ensure that the second round of our Year 2000 examinations are successfully completed. Our regional offices have also trained additional examiners and field managers who are available to be reassigned to Year 2000 duties should on-site work indicate the need for back-up assistance. In addition to assisting our Year 2000 examination work at thrifts, our IS examiners are examining third party entities that provide data processing services and software applications to thrifts. The IS managers and examiners also have an active role in training the S&S examiners and serve as a resource to S&S examiners. The IS examiners also take the lead on Year 2000 examination work at large thrifts that have in-house data systems and those of any size that have complex data processing environments. OTS regional management is coordinating the efforts of these examination disciplines to avoid duplication of work at institutions with in-house data centers. In addition to our specifically targeted Year 2000 examination efforts, we are looking at Year 2000 issues at all regularly scheduled S&S examinations of our regulated institutions and examinations of thrift holding companies. S&S examiners have been directed to factor Year 2000 risks and efforts into their assessment of thrift Management/Administration as part of the Uniform Financial Institution Rating System, also known as 'CAMELS.' They are also to consider an institution's exposure to other risks, such as credit risk, that may result from counterparties being unprepared for the Year 2000. We will continue to review Year 2000 issues at each thrift examination we conduct until problems are resolved. As we approach mid-year 1998, we will adjust our examination procedures to focus more on the final phases of the Year 2000 guidelines set forth in the May 1997 FFIEC Statement --'Validation,' which includes testing, and 'Implementation.' Finally, in a coordinated FFIEC interagency effort, our IS examiners are currently conducting Year 2000 examinations of the Multiregional Data Processing Servicers ('MDPS') and Shared Application Software Review ('SASW') bank software providers. MDPS data centers are large multiregional data processing servicers that pose a systemic risk to the financial industry should one or more of these entities fail. The SASR program includes firms that provide stand-alone customer software and integrated software packages that involve high risk applications for institutions, such as wire transfers, securities transfers, loans, deposits, and general ledger items. The FFIEC agencies are cooperating on a large-scale project to complete on-site Year 2000 examination work of all MDPS and SASR firms by early April. Significantly, this group of targeted companies provides over half of the core data processing products and services used by the banking and thrift industries. This coordinated, interagency project will ensure that: (1) the Year 2000 progress of key service providers posing the greatest risks to the industry is measured; (2) the Year 2000 efforts of these entities are consistently evaluated; (3) Year 2000 compliance information is shared among the regulatory agencies; and, (4) examination findings of service providers are shared with client federally insured financial institutions. C. Enforcement and Contingency Planning Our examination procedures require examiners to initiate supervisory follow-up whenever problems are detected or concerns arise. OTS regional management uses appropriate informal and formal enforcement tools to remedy supervisory problems. Informal enforcement tools include: (1) increased on-site supervision through supplemental examinations and field visits focusing primarily on Year 2000 issues; (2) accelerated full-scope examinations; (3) directives to institution boards of directors through letters and meetings to ensure safe and sound operations; and (4) required responses from boards of directors containing key dates and milestones for correcting Year 2000 deficiencies. Formal enforcement tools include supervisory agreements, cease- and-desist orders ('C&Ds'), temporary C&Ds and civil money penalties. OTS regional staff have been advised to involve legal counsel early in the process when problems surface and to establish a proper trail to facilitate the timely issuance of any necessary formal enforcement actions related to the Year 2000. Of significance is a recent directive that establishes a rebuttable presumption of a formal enforcement action when an institution is rated 'Unsatisfactory' for Year 2000 purposes. In addition, our Year 2000 training efforts specifically address enforcement matters such as the need for prompt action whenever problems are cited. The FFIEC agencies have formed a multi-disciplinary working group that includes representatives from our respective legal, examination, supervision, and receivership areas. This task force is developing uniform approaches to contingency plans designed to mitigate systemic risks. One aspect of our efforts has focused on possible enforcement actions against financial institutions, service companies, and independent data servicers not meeting the guidelines set forth in the May 1997 FFIEC Statement. We are taking steps to ensure that our examiners respond quickly and appropriately through the use of informal supervisory methods as well as formal enforcement tools, where appropriate. The unique prospect of an institution failing due to a technological disruption rather than a lack of capital has prompted an interagency effort to study the specific technical impact that a Year 2000 failure will have on an institution's books, records, systems and operations. The FFIEC agencies are organizing a team of regulators with a variety of skills and perspectives, including S&S examiners, information systems examiners, attorneys and accountants to conduct this study. The goals of this effort are: --to isolate technological failures and identify potential work- around solutions in the event of a Year 2000 failure; --to ensure consistent application to all institutions and service providers of our supervisory and resolution strategies; --to develop a better understanding of the interdependencies of depository institution systems; and --to gain a better understanding of the likely consequences posed by corrupt data that we may encounter. On-site visits to selected financial institutions by the study team will begin in early April. In addition, since April 1997, we have considered Year 2000 preparedness in connection with our corporate applications process review. In at least one case, we have imposed a general requirement regarding Year 2000 compliance as a condition of approval. If appropriate, we will deny applications or impose specific Year 2000 compliance conditions as part of an approval. We are very close to releasing formal guidance to prospective applicants that incorporate more stringent requirements relative to Year 2000 issues. IV. Response to GAO Findings We are very pleased that the GAO recognizes and appreciates the hard work the OTS has put into its overall Year 2000 campaign, and the efforts we will undertake between now and the millennium. During our exit meeting on March 10 with our GAO evaluators, we were particularly pleased with Mr. Brock's statements that overall he saw 'a responsible effort going on here,' that on the internal side, his findings unearthed a 'couple of nits,' and that we were 'not in bad shape with one exception,' which related to the contingency plan discussed above. With regard to our industry supervision efforts, Mr. Brock indicated that his findings were 'not incredibly significant.' We are also encouraged by the positive and cooperative working relationship we established with the GAO evaluators on this review. We believe that much can be gained from having others look at our work, and welcome the independent critique GAO provides. We look forward to working with Mr. Brock's team as our Year 2000 work continues. Mr. Chairman, we understand the pressing urgency of this GAO review, as well as those being conducted of the other banking regulatory agencies regarding Year 2000 preparations. I am sure you can appreciate that we want to do the best job we can, and to be as responsive as possible to you and your colleagues. Clearly, we would have preferred more time to prepare for this hearing, and would have appreciated the opportunity to carefully review the written findings of the GAO. Notwithstanding these difficulties, we will attempt to offer our observations with regard to the items discussed at our exit interview last week. Generally, many of the GAO's observations relating to our supervision of the industry involve timing. The GAO believes that the agencies, including OTS, should have started addressing this issue sooner than we did, and should have been more prompt in disseminating guidance to the industry on key topics. In particular, the GAO recommends that we: --work with the other FFIEC agencies to complete by the end of March 1998 our guidance to institutions on customer risk exposure, and on due diligence for service providers and software vendors; --work with the other FFIEC agencies to develop contingency planning guidance and set a deadline for completing this effort; and, --provide more guidance to institutions on renovation, validation and implementation. We certainly agree with the merits of an earlier start, but believe that we must look forward and make the best use of the time we have remaining. This requires us to continue our vigorous examination regimen and work to complete the FFIEC advisories as promptly as possible. We believe that this testimony lends ample support to our resolve to address the Year 2000 computer problem in a comprehensive and responsible way. The FFIEC papers on customer risk and vendor due diligence are being released this week. The FFIEC agencies have also established a working group to develop contingency planning guidance, and we expect to complete that project later this spring. Finally, the agencies are completing additional industry guidance on Year 2000 testing procedures, which also should be released this spring. The GAO also recommends that the OTS work with the other FFIEC agencies to develop a tactical plan that details the results of our industry assessments and indicates the actions we intend to take based on those results. We will work closely with the other agencies to address this recommendation. However, we believe that the GAO could assist us and the other agencies by discussing with us the specific expectations it has in mind for this tactical plan. OTS already has supervisory follow-up procedures in place for when institutions are rated 'Needs Improvement' or 'Unsatisfactory' for Year 2000 purposes. The GAO indicates they would like to see the FFIEC Year 2000 Examination Procedures organized differently and include specific questions about each phase of the Year 2000 project management plan. We, as well as the other FFIEC agencies, agree that the product can be improved and are already working to accomplish this. We are particularly interested, in supplementing those questions pertaining to the critical, and resource-intensive, testing phase. We believe it is important to mention again that OTS has supplemented the FFIEC guidance with other questions and examination steps, and with examiner judgment. As noted in this testimony, we prepared an industry assessment from the results of our first round of supplemental off-site Year 2000 examinations, and have developed a detailed internal survey to help us analyze examination results from our second round of Year 2000 examinations. The GAO is also concerned that the FFIEC guidance issued to date does not provide firm guidance on the timing of different phases of the Year 2000 project management plan. We are reviewing our existing guidance and will be clarifying our expectations with regard to when testing should begin, and when it should be completed. We expect to issue these clarifications soon. The GAO remarks further indicate that the OTS has not determined the level of technical resources needed adequately to evaluate the Year 2000 conversion efforts of thrifts and service providers. Their concern is that our resources will be strained by examinations that increase in length and technical complexity. Significantly, we are currently conducting an agency-wide analysis of examination resource needs. This analysis includes an assessment of IS examination resources. Although we believe we have an outstanding IS examination program, we fully recognize that it must be structured to ensure proper coverage and attention to the Year 2000 problem, and to respond to the rapidly changing technological landscape. During the past eight years, our case-load of thrift institutions has dropped from over 3000 to about 1200. During this time, OTS also downsized its workforce to respond to the reduction in the number of thrift institutions. However, our IS examination staff resources remained relatively constant during this period while gaining valuable experience. Most of our IS examiners are accredited Federal Information Systems Regulators, and have earned the designation of 'Certified Information Systems Auditor.' Further, we recently introduced a training course for our S&S examiners to enhance their knowledge of emerging information technology. We expect that virtually all our S&S examiners will attend this training course. Moreover, as noted earlier, we have provided in-depth Year 2000 training to a select group of S&S examiners. Since most of our thrifts outsource their complex data processing needs, our S&S staff can more than adequately assess information system risk exposure at these institutions, including that related to Year 2000 compliance. Our IS examination staff provides technical guidance and assistance to these examiners, as necessary. With respect to GAO's recommendation that the OTS develop contingency plans for mission critical systems and core business processes, as mentioned earlier, we will have a Year 2000 contingency plan in place by mid-year 1998. A senior OTS program manager has been assigned to lead this effort. The plan will be based on available guidance from the Treasury Department and will incorporate results we have obtained from our renovation efforts and validation tests. We believe that our plan will be more comprehensive and that we will be better prepared by having the benefit of these results as we complete the plan. In response to GAO's recommendation that we address and develop a comprehensive Year 2000 program plan, as discussed earlier, we have completed Year 2000 plans for the agency's information systems, for our Washington and Regional infrastructure, and for our industry regulatory efforts. The plans were developed separately as the program requirements were defined by the Treasury Department, the agency, and the FFIEC agencies. Although the integrity of our current efforts has not been threatened due to the lack of an integrated plan, pursuant to the GAO's recommendation, we will integrate the separate plans into a comprehensive agency plan. This document will be developed in parallel with our contingency planning efforts by mid-year 1998. Importantly, OTS has already integrated its status reporting to the Treasury Department, to Congress and to OTS senior management. Monthly status reports are prepared for the Treasury Department that address all key program areas, with quarterly cost information updated for Treasury in an integrated worksheet. In addition, status reports on our internal systems as well as industry progress on Year 2000 efforts are provided quarterly to Congress. Finally, OTS senior management is kept abreast of agency progress on Year 2000 issues through periodic reports from those responsible for the various aspects of the agency's Year 2000 efforts. V. Conclusion Mr. Chairman, we believe the combination of our examination efforts, our active supervision of the thrift industry, and our monitoring of our own compliance efforts should ensure that effective and timely actions are taken to avoid problems involving thrifts and the OTS when the calendar rolls over to the Year 2000. We know that, no matter how well we are prepared, there will be glitches and problems. We are committed to addressing those problems and making the Year 2000 conversion process as manageable as possible for our regulated institutions.
