GAO: Year 2000 Computer Problems Persist

A congressional investigator warned yesterday that several federal agencies still are not moving fast enough in repairing their computer systems so they will work in the year 2000. Despite an expected last-minute push, he predicted that some agencies will not finish in time, increasing the possibility of botched financial transactions, grounded airplanes and inoperable military systems.
The warning -- issued by Gene L. Dodaro, the General Accounting Office's assistant comptroller general -- follows a recent Clinton administration report raising costs of the repair work by $800 million and indicating that only 35 percent of the government's "mission critical" computer systems have been fully repaired.
"At the current pace, it is clear that not all mission critical systems will be fixed in time," Dodaro told a joint hearing of two House technology subcommittees. The GAO has predicted for about a year that some crucial systems will miss the deadline, but yesterday's appraisal was delivered in more bleak tones and raised the possibility of government computer failures leading to spillover problems for the private sector. "America's infrastructures are a complex array of public and private enterpriseswith many interdependencies at all levels," he said.
The potential chaos stems from the fact that many computer systems use a two-digit dating system that assumes that 1 and 9 are the first two digits of the year. Without specialized reprogramming, the systems will recognize "00" not as 2000 but 1900, a glitch that could cause the computers either to stop working or to start generating erroneous data.
John A. Koskinen, a former Office of Management and Budget official who was tapped by President Clinton last month to spearhead the government's conversion efforts, agreed that agencies need to hasten their progress, but he urged the subcommittees not to advance doomsday scenarios.
"We need to avoid creating panic and precipitous, counter productive activity," Koskinen said. Talking to reporters after the hearing, he said that agencies "are confident of meeting the March '99 deadline" established by OMB for systems to be repaired and tested.
Koskinen, who directs a presidential council on the year-2000 issue, said his group will work with state and local governments as well as the private sector to ensure that data-exchange activities will continue to function smoothly after repairs are made.
The OMB said last week that as of Feb. 15, about 35 percent of the 7,850 mission critical systems have been fixed. About 45 percent still have to be repaired, 15 percent will be replaced and 5 percent will be retired.
Mission critical systems include those that process benefit checks, crunch tax returns, monitor food safety, direct air traffic and support national security activities.
The OMB, which estimated the costs of fixing the problem at $2.3 billion last February, said the price tag has mushroomed to $4.7 billion, including an $800 million increase between November and February.
Although OMB officials have long said they expect the final figure to be about $5 billion, Rep. Stephen Horn (R-Calif.), who co-chaired yesterday's hearing, predicted the cost will increase substantially: "I think you're going to be close to $10 billion when you're done with this."
Horn recently released a report card on agencies' progress that flunked the departments of Education, Defense, Transportation, Labor and State. At their current rate of repairs, Horn said Education would finish fixing all its mission critical systems in 2002, Transportation in 2003, Labor in 2007, Defense in 2009 and State in 2014.
"We have a lot of work to do and little time remaining," Horn said.
Horn also raised concerns about plans to fix the 60,000 non-mission-critical systems in federal agencies.
"We must constantly remind ourselves that the mission-critical systems we talk about are but the tip of the iceberg," he said.
The hearing was held by the House Science subcommittee on technology and the Government Reform and Oversight subcommittee on government management, information and technology.
