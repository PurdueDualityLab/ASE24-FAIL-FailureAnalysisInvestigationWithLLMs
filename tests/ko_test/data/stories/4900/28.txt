HEARING OF THE HOUSE BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE;SUBJECT: YEAR 2000 PROBLEMBY: REPRESENTATIVE JIM LEACH (R-IA)
03/25/1998

REP. LEACH: Today the committee continues its hearings of oversight hearing in the so-called Year 2000 Problem. In the first two hearings, the committee limited its focus to the Year 2000 status and the financial regulatory agencies and the bank thrifts and the credit unions, under the committee's jurisdiction. I am pleased to report that since our last hearing in February, the House and Senate have both passed and the President signed into law, legislation which stemmed from this committee in January, to strengthen the authority of the thrift and credit union regulators to address certain aspect of this problem. Today the committee is adding to its Year 2000 oversight agenda, other departments and agencies, primarily HUD treasury's who's programs and services fall under the jurisdiction of the committee. Among the questions we will address are the following: what exactly are the Year 2000 stakes at treasuring HUD, is there risk of public harm with commuter systems in these departments failed, or is the risk, if any, only one of inconvenience, are Year 2000 Problems being addressed in a timely matter, what, if anything, does this committee to do to ensure federal services continued uninterrupted. In the case of the treasury, the committee notes that the latest OMB report raises concerns about the Year 2000 Problems of the financial management services, FMS which handles 850 federal payments a year with the total of $1 trillion. Those payments impact some hundred million people including elderly and disabled social security beneficiary's and veterans. The committee also notes that OMB has raised concerns about Year 2000 Problems at the mint, which recently added 19 more items to its mission critical list. In the area of cost, the committee notes that the multi-year price tags for treasury's Year 2000, remediation programs has risen to $1.43 billion and second only to the Department of Trust Defense, and the treasury is depending before Congress, and request for nearly $175 million in fiscal year '98 supplemental to meet its raising Y2K cost. Turning to HUD, we're told by the Department, that if its disbursement system failed, no transaction would be produced to treasury for payment to homeowners, landlords, neighborhood community associations, public and Indian housing authorities, state housing authorities or mortgage investors. We're also informed that FHA computer systems handles some $8 million mortgage insurance records. The committee is interested in the broader issue of national readiness as well, for the Year 2000, and while the committee is responsible for monitoring the readiness of agencies under its immediate jurisdiction, ultimately their welfare and the welfare of their constituency's is highly dependent on efforts of other agencies and sectors the economy beyond jurisdiction. Thus it will not be sufficient for banks, for example, to depend only on their own Year 2000 fixes, they must rely as well on Year 2000 readiness at their local phone company. They must rely on the Year 2000 readiness of local business borrowers, if their outstanding loans are to be repaid, and must rely on local power companies for electricity. Clearly this illustrates why there is such a compelling need for national leadership and coordination ensure that all federal agencies, state and local governments under the private sector adequately prepare to handle the transition. In that regard, I'm pleased to welcome today the Presidents new appointed to the chair of the Year 2000 Conversion Council. We look forward to finding out what his and the administration's strategic plan is for preventing a breakdown in the key federal services as well as for assuring the viability of key national infrastructures and banking and finance, public health transportation, telecommunications and electrical power. I also want to extend a special welcome to our witnesses from GAO of conducting extensive work to the committee and issues relating to this problem. And now agencies such as HUD, as well as the financial regulatory agencies. We look forward to GAO council directing the committees' attention to these issues, which require our attention. At this time I would like to ask if John LaFalce has an opening statement.
REP. JOHN LAFALCE (D-NY): I thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is the third hearing the Banking Committee has held on the Year 2000 computer problem. But, it's appropriate that we have today's hearing even more. For, I do not believe that the American public and the majority of businesses, yet fully grasp the significance or magnitude of the challenge we face. In a very short time, computers have become essential to almost every economic activity in which we engage, both personally as individuals and as business and labor market participants. Computers not only compute payrolls, bank statements, mortgages and car loans, but also computes dates, and lot numbers and food items, the research analysis of DNA, mail order shopping, hospital patient records, health insurance, the list is endless. We do not yet fully comprehend the potential adverse impact on everyone, in every walk of life, if the Y2K problem is not fixed. According to DRI estimates, the Y2K problem, could cost the United States alone $119 billion in lost economic output between now and the year 2001. The economic growth rate next year could be .3 percentage points lower that it otherwise would be as companies divert resources to fix the problem. And Y2K could cut on other half percentage point in the Year 2000 and another in the year 2001. Some economists are actually predicting a 35 to 40 percent chance of recession directly related to Y2K. Y2K could cause inflation to rise. It could cause productivity to drop. As demands for skilled laborers, specifically computer programmers and wages rise in order to fix the problem, inflation could also rise. According to the Information Technology Association of America, the US already has 350 thousand job vacancies for computer scientists and programmers. Companies may have to divert resources in labor and capital to fixing rather than creating or installing productivity, productivity enhancing programs, thus the potential in US productivity. The amount and time skilled labor needed to meet this challenge is mind boggling. The software productivity research group estimates that finding, fixing and testing, all Year 2000 affected software would require over 700 thousand (programmers ?). This probably explains the demand for new workers and management consulting in accounting firms that have hired 200 thousand new workers over the past 2 years. Bank of America in San Francisco, has 1000 people working full time, examining 200 million lines of computer code at a cost of one quarter of a billion dollars. Chase Manhattan expects to spend a quarter of a billion of dollars over the next two years. And City Corp. expects to spend almost one half billion dollars. Y2K may cost the 35 largest US regional banks, about two billion dollars for the three years ending in 1999. The smaller banks are at a tremendous disadvantage because they do not have the resources to cope with the problem, or the where with all hire much in demand programmers to fix the problem. So Mr. Chairman, it is essential that we oversee, very closely, the progress the agencies under our committee jurisdiction are making on meeting these deadlines. HUD's critical housing programs, treasury central functions from bond markets to IRS and the federal reserve and other financial institution regulator's responsibilities for banks, credit unions and thrifts, must not be interrupted because of massive computer failures. Mr. Chairman, I believe it's essential for us to examine, at a later date, the status of banks and businesses worldwide, in regard to their efforts to adjust to the Year 2000 computer challenge. But even if we in the United States are able to meet our deadline for adjusting our computers, we still are linked with banks and business, and therefore computers in the global economy. And so, we must really all work together, globally too, to fix this problem. I thank the Chair. REP. BAKER: Thank you, John. Mr. Lazio.
REP. RICK LAZIO (R-NY): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you for your leadership, as Mr. LaFalce had mentioned, this is the third series of hearings on an issue that will only become more important as we approach the Year 2000. I'm somewhat hopeful given that among the agencies under the committees jurisdiction, there is evidence that HUD is well on its well to Year 2000 compliance and that is particularly gratifying, because HUD is otherwise an agency that has been called at risk by GAO, I think, since 1994, and (NAP ?) has been stinging in its criticism with the department. According to OMB, as of February, HUD was certified as a tier two agency with a three tier classification, meaning that HUD is doing better than many agencies. But items of concern still remain. The subcommittee on Government Management Information and Technology also rated HUD's efforts at a 'B' level, putting HUD among the top third of the 24 agencies the subcommittee rated. Having subcommittee's also working in GAO to monitor HUD's information systems, and I might note, Mr. Chairman, there is 90 data systems, and their efforts of trying integrate those systems are exceptionally important in effort that will invariably have an impact on the Departments Y2K work. I also want to take this opportunity to once again emphasize the excellent work and cooperation that we've had with the General Accounting Office have been very important in terms of oversight for the subcommittee in general, for this member and this chairman and they've been a key part of our ability to (probe ?) policy. I look forward to continue working with the Chairman and the administration to ensure that HUD, the agency that provides assistance for some 4 million families in public and assisted housing, ensures mortgages for almost 7 million homeowners who's well prepared for January first 2000. Thank you, Chairman.
REP. LEACH: Thank you, Rick. Mr. Castle.
REP. LEACH: Let me welcome our first witness, and our first witness comes with a title that has never been before this committee before, because it's a title that's seldom been before any committee of Congress. But the gentleman who holds that title is well known to the Congress for a high reputation and distinction in public services and we welcome Mr. John Koskinen, who is the Chairman of the President's Council on the Year 2000 Conversion. We thank you, for coming and we wish you good luck in your job. Please proceed sir.
MR. KOSKINEN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I pleased to appear before the committee to discuss the Year 2000 Problem in my new role as chair of the Presidents Council on Year 2000 Conversion. And with your permission, I'll submit to the record my full statement and summarize it here.
REP. LEACH: Without objection, of course.
MR. KOSKINEN: Thank you. I'd like to start by thanking you and the other members of the committee for your ongoing interest in raising public awareness about the Year 2000 Problem. Help ensure the systems for already January 1, Year 2000. Particularly I would like to applaud the committee for its work on HR-3116, the examination parity and Year 2000 readiness for Financial Institution Act, which the President was pleased to sign last Friday. In signing this bill, President called the Year 2000 Problem one of the great challenges of the information age in which we live. Like each of you, the President want to ensure that individuals in the public and private sectors are doing all they can to meet that challenge. Therefore last month he issued executive order 13073 creating the President's council on Year 2000 conversion. He has also made it clear recently, at a meeting of his cabinet, that agency's heads bear the full responsibility for the successful preparation of their agency's mission critical systems of the transition of the Year 2000. Recent reports from Congressman Horn and (Owens ?) on the Year 2000 progress in federal agencies, share a common finding. Agencies are making progress, but the rate of that progress needs to increase. No problem facing us is more pressing, especially since, unlike other Washington problems, neither the President nor Congress can force the deadline back. There is no question that the challenges are great, and I am confident that the council can play an important role in helping to meet them. However, we need to carefully structure the council's activities to maximize its effectiveness. GAO, which as has been noted, has done very valuable work in this area, has recently circulated a draft report recommending actions for the council. I have shared detailed comments on the draft with GAO, which I will submit for the record, but we generally agree with much of what they have to say. From my perspective, I think it is important for the council not to interfere with or duplicate the good work that is currently underway in the agencies, and is being done by other interagency management councils. Council should also build on rather than try to replace the important oversight role that OMB is playing and monitoring and reporting information gathered from the agencies. However, we have an obligation to the public to view this as more than just a federal systems problem. We need to adopt a global prospective, and I think the councils real contribution will be made by coordinating work by the agencies with those outside of the federal government. Individual agencies have a major role to play in this regard. For example, I think the council could be more effective by enlisting and supporting agencies like the Treasury Department or the Federal Reserve, as the coordinator, on outreach to financial institutions, empowering them to determine the appropriate measures government should take to assure progress in this area. Let me now turn to describing more specifically what the council will be doing. We will monitor the progress of those responsible for fixing the problems in federal agencies. I've already begun to embark on what I finally refer to as my agency of the day tours, where I am meeting with a meeting agency heads, their deputies, their chief information officers, and those leading their Year 2000 efforts to discuss their situation. In each meeting, I have been asking three key questions about the status of the work on their systems. What are their major risks? What are the significant obstacles removing those risks? And what contingency plans are appropriate in the light of that analysis? I am also talking to agencies about the external systems with which they interface. Particularly in day to day exchanges with state and local governments, even if all of the federal governments with critical systems function effectively on January 1, 2000, the public will still suffer substantial adverse consequences if our systems cannot communicate with the external systems with which they need to exchange data to operate key federal programs. Let me discus briefly, specific meetings I have had with two agencies of concern to you, and mentioned in the chairman's opening statement -- the Treasury Department, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. I have met with Secretary Rubin, and his senior management team, and am pleased to report the treasuries clearly focused on this problem at the highest levels. The secretary of the Treasury's chief operating officer, their information officer, gave me a detailed update on the progress they are making. Systems of particular concern are those at the Internal Revenue Service, and the Financial Management Service. The IRS has the challenge of dealing with the Year 2000 Problem, at the same time it continues to work on a modernization program that will transcend the Year 2000. However, the new IRS commissioner is very experienced in these areas, and I think there is sound basis for the confidence being placed in him. FMS has also has been a source of some concern in light of it's interactions with virtually every federal department. Here too, a new management team has directed it's attention away from relying only a complete replacement of critical systems which will be completed over time, and is now focused on ensuring that the existing operation will function effectively as we move into the Year 2000. We also discussed the implications of the Year 2000 Problem for the banking industry, particularly on an international level, and the roles Treasury and International Financial Organizations like the IMF and the World Bank, can play in increasing awareness and facilitating information exchanges among nations. Secretary Rubin has been a leader in government in raising awareness of this problem in meetings around the world and he is committed to continue doing so at upcoming international meetings, both here and abroad. While I was not able to meet with Secretary Cuomo prior to my testimony today, I did meet with members of HUD's senior management team, including acting Deputy Secretary Saul Ramirez (sp), their chief financial officer and their Year 2000 project manager. HUD is focused on the problem at the highest levels as well, and my meeting with the senior management team was also very productive. HUD is presently on schedule to meet the new OMB government-wide goals for ensuring that systems are Year 2000-compliant. And the Secretary receives regular reports on the Department's progress. HUD has also begun to reach out to its business partners, which include mortgage companies, state and local public housing authorities and the nation's cities, to increase awareness and offer assistance. In the event that these business partners experience their own system failures, HUD has developed contingency plans to ensure that the Department will still be able to receive and process important data. To conserve time here, let me proceed to, basically, our final view which is the Council needs to, as I noted, reach out and encourage agencies to reach out to those as Treasury and HUD have already agreed to do so to ensure that to the extent possible, in a global economy that is increasingly dependent upon the electronic exchange of financial and other data, we do everything we can to ensure that other nations, as well as other entities, are devoting the appropriate level of attention to the Year 2000 Problem. As I've stated in other contexts, there is no doubt that the problem poses significant challenges to our government, the nation and the world. While it is important to increase worldwide attention to the urgent necessity of solving this problem, we need to avoid creating panic and precipitous counterproductive activity. The best way for us to spend the next 21 months will be to address the challenges that lie before us in a very aggressive but measured way and marshal the resources at our disposal in the most effective way possible. Mr. Chairman, I thank the committee for its continued interest in the Year 2000 Problem and the constructive contributions you've already made. Those efforts have made, and continue to make, a valuable contribution to the public dialogue about this matter and I look forward to continuing to work with you and would be happy to answer any questions you or other members of the panel may have. REP. LEACH: Well, I thank you, sir. I want to begin with the issue of resources, human resources, in particular. And I know there is some concern at the GAO with the Commerce Department assessments on the methodology that judgements were arrived at, but the strong anecdotal evidence from my state is that we do have an enormous shortage of software engineering talent. And that there are real jobs going unfilled. And so one of the proposals in Congress is to increase the visa numbers for this particular area. Does your office have a position on this?
MR. KOSKINEN: We do not at this time, Mr. Chairman. In my meetings with the Agencies we are discussing their personnel resources and thus far the Agencies seem comfortable, although cognizant of the problem, that they have the resources they need now. We have also encouraged OPM to meet with, as they did last week, the Chief Information Officers, counsel, and they will meet with all the Deputy Secretaries in a forum known as the President's Management Council, to talk both about the existing authorities that Agencies have, both to provide incentive bonuses for people to join the federal government in this area and retention compensation and other incentives to make sure that we don't lose resources that will become increasingly valuable over the next two years. They have also stated they will consider working with the Agencies to allow us to bring back into the government those who were retired and have unique and particular expertise to assist us. So at this stage, we think from the federal government standpoint internally, it's a management problem and I don't have enough information about the nationwide situation to be able to respond beyond that.
REP. LEACH: Well let me go on, because I would like to suggest that there are two issues. And I addressed a little different one than the one you responded to, but they're very interlinked. One is, as a national resource, are there sufficient people in this arena to deal, not only with the (Y2K?) problem, but software engineering in general? And we have an H1B Visa Program that allows a given number of people in under this visa. There are proposals to approximately double it from 46,000 to 90,000 or so a year. I'm rather impressed with that proposal and I think it's something that makes a great deal of common sense for the country. And I would hope that your office would give attention to it because you might well be a rudder of judgement on that issue. But based upon documentation from companies in my state, and I realize my state is one of 50, there is staggering demand for software talent. And one of the new evidences of it is, not only the jobs that are going unmet, one of my town's one company has an open invitation for 400 software engineers that simply don't exist. But is the fact that this is the first time in my memory that graduates of Iowa State University are being offered bonuses to sign up. I've never heard of bonuses for jobs. And that is a fairly strong evidentiary circumstance. But we've also had a perversion in our immigration laws that I think is bizarre that from time to time over the last 40 years we have given advantages to non-talented people over talented people. And I'm enough of an American chauvinist to think that we ought to bias our laws towards people of mathematical talent. And I would hope your office would give this issue a serious review. The second issue relates to our government versus the private sector. And you've given a very optimistic appraisal; one that I'm not convinced is warranted. I'm hearing more and more anecdotal observations that very good people are being offered substantially higher salaries outside the government and it just happens that in several of these areas of Y2K import the government has a great obligation to be prepared. And so it's a very worrisome phenomenon to think in terms of a possible talent shortage. And now are you confident in your appraisal?
MR. KOSKINEN: I'm confident in my appraisal as of today, but I have, as I've noted, asked OPM to monitor this situation closely. We had a meeting with all the chief information officers at the Agencies last week with OPM to discuss this. OPM has an Information Technology, Human Resources Subcommittee that the CIOs will now interface with. And we will continue to monitor this program because I am concerned that certainly for entry-level employees who have been here a relatively short period of time, or those eligible to retire, both ends of the appointment spectrum. Those are the ones I think we're most at risk of losing to industry. On the other hand, there are incentives to work for the federal government in terms of public service and other issues and the immediate short-term focus on the Y2K problem will, of course, be over one way or the other in the next two years. But I think we need to pay attention to what a corollary issue that we are focused on is that as we move forward we need to be able to marshal the resources within the government. So there may come a time at which a given Agency will have completed the work on its mission-critical systems. And rather than having valuable and scarce resources continue to work on less important systems in that Agency, we may need to develop programs where you move either employees or contractors from one Agency to another which is still confronting major systems problems that would affect all of us. So I think we need to both look at the problem you're talking about, which is can we attract, and more importantly retain, a critical set of personnel resources. And secondly we need to look at these resources not just as Agency-specific resources, but we need cognizant of them as a government-wide resource. Because there are a set of major systems in this government that we cannot allow to fail and if we need to divert or move resources on a temporary basis from one place to another, I think we're going to need to be able to do that.
REP. LEACH: Good. I want to turn to John, but I'd like to request a formal response from your office in the next several weeks on this H1B Program. That is, I want to set up, I want to ask you to respond in writing to the committee on your opinion of it - (Cross talk.)
MR. KOSKINEN: But I think I will draw a distinction between the Y2K shortage and the longer-term computer software issues, which are not my immediate concern. I have, as you know, enough problems with the Y2K problem. But I would be delighted. REP. LEACH: Well, that's fair enough, but I do think there is an overlap. You know, I don't think, even though one is of a shorter duration, although if things don't go well it might go a little longer duration than we'd like, but -- MR. KOSKINEN: I would be pleased to respond to that proposal. REP. LEACH: Good. Great. Thank you. Mr. LaFalce. REP. LAFALCE: I thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm hesitant to ask questions in this area because it's all too easy to reveal my ignorance. But I'll proceed anyway. I really want your guidance now. What should we be doing in Congress to be helpful, above and beyond having hearings such as this, is one question? Then what should the Executive Branch Agencies be doing and Regulatory Agencies be doing, such as the Fed and the SEC, et cetera? Then what should the private sector be doing? And the private sector is a multiplicity of companies; you have your behemoths, but then you also have your very small mom and pop stores, too. So what should the small business be doing in particular who's got half a dozen employees, but depends upon the computer? And then what should the individual who has a computer at home be doing, who uses the computer to check up on his or her stocks, to find out the latest news, to e-mail, to pay bills, et cetera? And is there even a problem for that individual who uses, at home who uses it at home or uses the computer for those type of purposes. MR. KOSKINEN: How many minutes do I have to respond to all that? Let me start at the top. In terms of being helpful, first, I would not under estimate the significant contribution you and other committees have made in raising the level of public awareness. I think it has been -- the hearings have been significant. I think there have been good responses as a result of that. Beyond that, I think it is important for all of us and as we match the first and the last point, for all of us, and Congresswoman Morella and I were talking before this hearing, wherever we go, not to give Y2K speeches necessarily but we continue to note to people that we all think this is important, this is a national and a global issue and to ask all the audiences out there are you satisfied that you have in fact in your corporations, in your operations, in your daily lives that you have asked that question enough is there a problem I should be concerned about and what should I do about it. Individual consumers can ask their banks, they can ask their grocery stores, they can ask everyone else they deal with will my credit card work, will my ATM card work, what have you done about it because what we need to do is continue to reinforce the really global nature of this problem. So all of you I'm telling Cabinet Agency, Secretaries, the same thing as they go out to groups to large groups, small groups, it's important for people to understand that on the one hand we're not saying the sky is falling or is about to fall but on the other hand this is an important issue. And the only way we'regoing to be able to deal with it in the time remaining, is to get as many people in as many areas possible asking questions about are we satisfied that our systems are going to work. In terms of what we can do in the Executive Branch and Regulatory Branch Agencies, the way that I look at this is it's a three-stage problem. First of all and that's in my meeting with agencies I'm asking them what are we doing about our own systems? You all yourselves need to ask what are you doing about congressional systems? You have a set of computer systems that support House operations. Beyond that we have to look at with whom does these systems communicate, where do we fund payments, where do we get information, and are those steady exchanges going to work from the standpoint of the federal government. Then beyond that we have to reach out and say who is out there operating in our areas of concern that we don't regulate, we don't exchange data with, but we have a great public interest in their continued successful operation. There are state and local governments. There are large private sector entities. There are energy companies. There are local distribution companies. Virtually everybody, as you know, in this age is dependent upon electronic transfer of data and financing and so what we need is the agencies need to solve their own problems. They need to worry about the people they relate to and then they need to exercise leadership in their areas of expertise in the private sector and internationally as well where it's appropriate trying to raise the level of awareness, share information about solutions and at a minimum at least be able to judge where will there be problems or at a minimum we have to have a contingency plans for. When you look at the private sector I think you're right to focus on small and medium size businesses which don't have separate independent information technology departments that often rely upon vendors for their existing software or upgrades or services and again, I think what every again when you talk to small businesses and the SBA has a good web site on this we need to have them ask their vendors, their suppliers, their bankers, are you Y-2 compliant, K compliant, am I going to have a problem when it comes to January 3rd that Monday of the Year 2000? REP. LAFALCE: So what do they do about their own computers? I mean you're not going to get the small businessman to worry about everybody he's dealing with or she's dealing with. MR. KOSKINEN: Well, I think he ought to. REP. LAFALCE: Well, that's fine. They ought to I suppose. We all -- but I think it's going to be difficult to get a small businessperson to start making inquires about others. But what should the small businessperson be thinking about is all computer capacity and he's own problems? MR. KOSKINEN: What he should be doing he or she in their operations -- most small to medium sized businesses rely upon outside vendors and service suppliers. They don't have their own software development programs so I think what they need to do is for their systems they need to ask the people they rely on normally for expertise is their a problem in the operation of my financial system, my payroll system if I run it myself or if you run it for me that will effect my day to day operations. They don't have to know anything about bits and bites and how this problem is solved but it's perfectly legitimate question for them to be asking their experts either their vendors or the people that they relied upon when they originally had the system set up. With regard to individuals, I'm not a computer expert either but my understanding is anyone who bought computers and software in the last two to three years should not have a problem. Even beyond that if you're doing the functions you discussed, the nature of your problem is likely to be that the date may not be correct as it shows up or when you log on and you may manually have to set the date. But for most personal computers in the use for word processing or electronic mail there should not be my understanding is much of a difficulty there. The problem comes when you start to do date sensitive calculations or when you're running processes depend upon embedded chips in hardware or when your running old systems and old programs. REP. LEACH: Thank you. In your testimony, sir, there is no reference to a prospect of doing a national assessment of YTK readiness. Are you considering such across a spectrum of private and public sector circumstances? Would that be a very helpful thing to do? MR. KOSKINEN: In effect, we're going to do, I hope a national assessment on a sector by sector basis. I think there's no way for my council no matter how many people they gave to manage it independently to start looking at an operation as complex as the United States in it's operations, economically and otherwise and to do an independent assessment certainly in the time we have available so the strategy I am following is mirrored to some extent on the work that's all ready been done in the critical infrastructure reviews. It looked at basic sectors of operation in the country. Energy as you know telecommunications, transportation to find out who is the logical leader at the federal level in that area and will they assume responsibility both for the out reach and also the assessment. So for instance I've met with the Secretary of Transportation and the Deputy as well as the FAA and they all agreed that they had -- willingly agreed that they should take responsibility for our working with those in the transportation sector even though it's not regulated by the federal government and developing an assessment. Is there -- what is it the status in rail transportation and other surface transportation? What's the status internationally? In a lot of places, we don't have the right to require anybody to give us the information. But it is important I think that and I think most of the people in the private sector understand we're all in this together and I think what we need to do is harness existing organizations whether they be business organizations or affinity groups to jointly try to determine where we are, what the nature of the problem is, and what we can all do to solve that. Now when we get done with that I think we will begin to pull together not a national assessment on a regular quarterly basis but an assessment of where our risks really are, where the priorities are, and again at a minimum at least be able to figure out what contingency plans we need to deal with those difficulties. REP. LEACH: Well thank you. In your -- you have an executive order that authorizes other agencies to participate in some sort of conversion council. Have you invited the FED to be part of that? MR. KOSKINEN: I'm meeting with the FED and I will invite them. I hope -- I've invited all. I've already met with some of the regulatory agencies. For instance, I had a good meeting with the FCC and Chairman Levin and his staff and they will have a member on that council as well. REP. LEACH: You're quoted in an article in something called Federal Computer Week suggesting that legislation similar to that initiated in this committee and signed by the President might be needed to help agencies address the problem with their contractors. Could you elaborate further on that? MR. KOSKINEN: At this time, I'm still discussing it with them and it appears that the Department of Health and Human Services and the Health Care Finance Agency has limitations on it's relationship with it's contractors. There are over 70 major providers who service Medicare and Medicare transactions. And historically, there are contractual statutory contractual limitations on their ability to deal with those contractors and I think we in very short order may need to change that legislation to give as much authority as we can to ensure that those service providers are actually able to run the Medicare and Medicaid transactions come the Year 2000. REP. LEACH: In Canada, there is has been a recent Y2K task force that's issued a report in which it recommended that the Canadian government in awarding all loans, grants or other systems ask for evidence of Year 2000 compliance. Should our government take a similar approach? MR. KOSKINEN: One of the first issues we're going to talk about when we get agency representatives for the council is the issue of what our relationships are to grantees ought to be. At a minimum, I am encouraging every agency as I meet with them to begin to at least discuss with their grantees the importance of the grantee being able to function. Those grantees are sometimes non-profit. Sometimes they're state and local government entities and we have two issues. One is can they -- will they be year 2 complaint in terms of the interface and exchange of data with us. But equally important it won't do us a whole lot of good to give money to a grantee that is then going to in fact not be able to function because of the year 200 problem so whether we make it contingent on the grant they already have or not I think at a minimum we need to discuss that. But at a minimum we need to ensure that there are very focused conversations between federal agencies and their grantees about the importance of the grantee being able to function effectively as we transcend into the Year 2000. REP. LEACH: Are you far enough along to be able to hazard any assessments on deniers to the financial community? MR. KOSKINEN: No. I think I met with the FDIC and the SCC and the OTS and I think that the regulators generally have done an excellent job independently and in response to interests of this committee and others in terms of reaching out to regulated entities and as I noted the bill you have passed will awe the OTS and the credit fail union administration to look at vendors to there regulated entities. At this stage, their I think there is more a level of uncertainty and concern that there are a lot of vendors and suppliers to financial institutions where we all have a stake in the institutions and those vendors and suppliers being able to deliver on their promises. At this stage there do not appear to be known significant risks or problems but we are at the front end of a monitoring of that and I think I gather all the banks will be reviewed by the middle of this year and I think that the vendor will have a much better appreciation on what the vendor problems are through the normal regulatory review process. REP. LEACH: Well I will say this committee has gotten antidotal again evidence that the vendors may not in as great shape as we'd hoped. Certainly the efforts of individual institutions for example in the credit union industry to ask the vendors if their complaint is resulted in non responses I think part of it relates to the fact that I think vendors are scared to death that if they respond even though they might be complaint that they may take on a legal liability which is an awkward problem too to be frank and might be a circumstance of either loss of work or to be frank might be a circumstance of legal liability when silence is more prudential. And so it's an oddity of getting assessments. Have you run into that problem? MR. KOSKINEN: I have not independently. I've reviewed the materials that led up to the passage of legislation and as I say meet with the FDIC and the OTS, their senior leadership and understand the process they've gone through. I think it is a critical point, I think that everyone has focused on it and that is the problem with trying to do with the agencies generally and that is get their insuring that not only your systems work but the systems you rely upon work and if people and vendors are into providing you back office services or other supportive services it's incumbent upon you to ensure that those services will continue to be provided if they are supplying you with software or other supplies directly. Again it is important to be able to ascertain that those are going to not create more problems than they solve for you. But again at this stage, I think there will be some peripheral concerns. Our hope is to keep them peripheral and one to do that is to determine as early as possible where the problems are going to be so that people can either change vendors, change suppliers or at least at an minimum be able to build contingency plans around possible failure of those -- (inaudible) --. Then again to Congressman LaFalce's question. One of my concerns in the small and mediums size business area is that a lot of them are just assuming that their vendors and suppliers and servicers will be compliant, to the extent they're even focused on the issue. And my concern is that we could end up, as we get closer to the Year 2000, discovering that a lot of vendors, a lot of back office suppliers to small businesses and others are not going to be able to function. Which will leave in major important parts of the economy at some risk. REP. LEACH: Well, thank you. I will only conclude by saying that there are sometimes difficulties in making assessments in almost any area of endeavor. I mean for example, where there's a real or partial shortage of software talent in this country for which slightly increasing visas might be helpful. But it seems to me that sometimes one needs a little insurance policy, too. And I'm not at all convinced, that there is a lack of insurance in this area at this time, and you compare all the demands worldwide that we could have a major problem and that in the financial services area. It's critical for all needs that we have things in order. But there is also an enormous international opportunity if we're compliant and others are not. This becomes a circumstance, in my judgement, where you could have a run to American financial institutions worldwide, that could be very healthy for our economy in the long run. And so I think we have a vested interest to err on the side of prudence and to err on the side of probably a safety net of talented workers. And I hope your office gets that consideration. And frankly, as I've looked at these proposals on the H1B Program, it strikes me they're fairly conservative. And I would up numbers even more than is currently in the congressional side. But I think it might be very interesting from your office's focal point to assess that issue very seriously. And so I simply repeat my earlier observations and hope you do. Anyway, thank you, very much. MR. KOSKINEN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. REP. LEACH: Our next witness is Mr. Joel C. Willemssen, who is Director of Civil Agencies Information Systems, accounting and information management division of general accounting office. And you're accompanied by Mr. Jack L. Brock Junior, from your department. Is that correct? MR. WILLEMSSEN : Yes, Mr. Chairman, I am here to discuss government wide Year 2000 issues and those issues at HUD. And Mr.Brock has a responsibility within GAO for the financial institutions Year 2000 issue. REP. LEACH: Okay, before you begin, let me comment on something Mr. Lazio indicated early and that is the very fine work of the GAO in this area, and it's my view that they're very few issues where symbolically, the GAO is more appropriate to do this work, and has provided a more forthcoming effort, and I am very respectful of the perspective that you've brought to the subject. Please begin. MR. WILLEMSSEN : Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As requested, I'll briefly summarize our views on where the federal government is at on Year 2000 and also at HUD, and then Mr. Brock was going to briefly summarize our work in the financial institutions if that's acceptable. REP. LEACH: Of course. MR. WILLEMSSEN : Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Regarding the overall Year 2000 issue, while some progress has been made in addressing Year 2000 readiness, serious risks remain. At the current pace of many agencies, not all mission critical systems are going to be fixed in time. The appointment of Mr. Koskinen to head the Year 2000 conversion council, is an opportunity to provide the necessary leadership in this area. We've provided a draft report to Mr. Koskinen, laying out our recommendations to address this area. And I wanted to briefly highlight some of those recommendations. First, it's critical that we establish government wide priorities. Such priority setting is essential to make sure that the most important systems are fixed on time. Those priorities need to be based on criteria's such as health, safety, financial impact, and also our national defense. Second, for those selected government wide priorities, we need to make sure that the Executive Branch has end to end operational testing of those systems, crossing agency boundaries. As you mentioned earlier, FMS is a critical element in this. Third, we need to make sure contingency plans are done for the most mission critical business processes, as we get closer to the deadline, it's more and more apparent that some agencies are going to run out of time. We need backup in the event that that happens. Fourth, the Executive Branch needs an independent verification strategy involving inspectors general, or other independent organizations to make sure that what agencies are reporting on their programs is accurate and complete, and also to make sure that their testing strategies and contingency plans are in place. Fifth, an area that you mentioned up front, the area of information and technology personnel is absolutely crucial in the Year 2000 area. We have begun to see more and more reports from selected departments and agencies that they are having difficulty being able to retain and attract the necessary talent to deal with this particular issue. And finally, we need to start thinking about Y2K beyond the boundaries of the major federal agencies. This is a national economic issue. And as such, Mr. Koskinen and his council need to address it as such. Let me briefly turn to HUD. HUD clearly recognizes the importance of Year 2000. They have established the Year 2000 project office, they have issued guidance, they've developed an overall Year 2000 strategy, overall a fairly sound program. However, there are some risks. For 30 mission critical systems that are undergoing renovation, currently 20 of those are behind HUD's own schedule. The delays on some of those systems are fairly significant because they are getting dangerously close to failure dates. That is that the first date that a system will actually fail. In HUD's case, some of those systems are not January one, 2000. They are a year to 15 months before that. Let me give you one quick example. HUD system for processing claims made by lenders on defaulted single family home loans is 75 days behind schedule for renovation, so the system's now scheduled to be implemented on November 4th, 58 days before its January first, 99 failure date. This system processes on average, about $350 million monthly of lenders claims for defaulted guaranteed loans, so if this system fails, then lenders will not get paid on time. Now, we're encouraged that the department recognizes these kind of slippage's and it willing to divert resources from lower priority activities to these mission critical systems. We support those kind of endeavors. And that concludes a quick summary of my statement, and if I may, I will turn it over to Mr. Brock to give you a summary on the financial institution's area. REP. LEACH: Thank you, Joel. Mr. Brock. MR. BROCK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I will also summarize. Let me start off with answering Mr. LaFalce's question about what can the committee do. One of the things that the committee is doing and has done that's been very effective for the financial institution, is having quarterly meetings, which are now having in conjunction with the Senate Banking, where all the regulators come up and give a very specific update of their progress, actions taken, problems being faced, et cetera. In our meetings with the individual regulators, we found that these meetings that they have with you have been very effective. It's sharpening their perspective that their actions, defining their actions, et cetera. So I would encourage you to keep that level of oversight. That's worked very well. As Joel mentioned, the Year 2000 is a big problem, and it's a particularly big problem with financial institutions. With the exception a very, very few credit unions that we found that are entirely manual, every single financial institution, whether it be a bank, a thrift, or a credit union, is vulnerable. And the size is staggering. There are over 22 thousand insured financial institutions, $ 6 trillion in assets and over $3 trillion in deposits. So it doesn't take much imagination to see that we have a problem, and a few of these institutions that you're creating a real problem in the nation's monetary supply and the flow of capital to and fro. So, it's a big issue, it's important. We feel that the regulators that were looking at it are accepting it as a very important issue, and they're dealing with it in, I think, a reasonable manner. That's not to say they couldn't have done better, but right now the actions that they're taking are reasonable. We do, however, have some initial concerns, which I hope will be addressed, but I'd like to focus more in my statement, I think about the real challenge that's going to be faced this summer, when the crunch time hits, and you're going to have to make some very, very difficult decisions about the trade-offs you're willing to accept, in order to assure a reasonable level of Y2K compliance. All of the regulators went through an initial round of assessments and the three regulators that we looked at to date, that's FDIC, OTS, and NCUA, they identified a number of institutions that had some level of concern. For example, FDIC identified over 200 banks that weren't adequately addressing Year 2000 risk, and 500 banks that were relying on third party servicers that had not followed up with these servicers to determine their readiness. We reported last week that OTS had identified 170 thrifts as being at high risk, due to poor performance and conducting awareness and assessment phase activity. NCUA has advised us that it's sent out formal agreements for corrective action, to over 4800 credit unions that were determined not to making sufficient progress, in at least one awareness or assessment phase category. So you have a fair number of institutions that are having some problem at this point. As I mentioned, we have completed an initial assessment at your request, of OTS, FDIC, and NCUA. We're in the process of looking at OCC and the Federal Reserve. We will be reporting on those, I would guess, within the nexvfffffffffvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvt two to three months. Additionally, we're doing a very detailed assessment of the key federal reserve systems, primarily as a check clearing systems and fed-wire to take a very specific look at the controls that are in place for those systems. While we found that the regulators have done a good job in making institutions aware of the problem, they have also done a good job to collectively beginning to examine the capabilities of the service providers and the vendors. We have also found that they started late, every one of them started late. This is an issue that should have been started years and years and years ago. Effectively, last year, year and a half ago, which was when most of the institutions got started. As a result, it compresses your time schedule. The latter phases, which many of the institutions are just now getting into, are in fact the phases of the process that take the longest, and if you have a problem in those phases, sometimes it's very difficult to develop any sort of remedial action, it's becoming too late. Secondly, we found that some of the key guidance that was being issued by FFIEC, should of, in fact, been issued much later. For example, last week FFIEC just issued the service and vendor guidance on how to interact with your service provider or your vendor, and how to relate to your corporate customers. These are things that banks need to be doing, or financial institutions need to be doing during the early phases of assessment. If, in fact, institutions have not done this because they're waiting for FFIEC guidance, they're late. If, in fact, some institutions have been doing it, but not doing it correctly or not doing enough, then they're also late. Lastly, contingency planning guidance, which is also critical institution, is not due until late this coming month. The late guidance, we believe, can heighten the opportunities of the chances that some financial institution may not be ready, or may limit their ability to get ready in a timely manner. The last issue we have with the regulators is an issue you were just discussing with Mr. Koskinen, and that's the whole area of adequate technical resources. We believe that, for the most part, the regulators that we've looked at do not have adequate technical resources. For example, when we went into NCUA, vthey had two information system examiners, FDIC had about 108, and OTS had 24. Now to some degree, they're supplementing these with contractors. They're hiring a few additional, but if you're looking at 22 thousand institutions that are entering the most difficult phases of Y2K conversion, we believe there needs to be a stronger technical presence within the regulators to make sure that the work is being done adequately. I think the real challenge, though, is coming up. By end of June, all of the regulators should have completed their own site evaluations, or assessments of the thrifts, the credit unions and the banks. They should also be through with their assessments of the vendors and be through with their assessments of the service providers. Taking this information collectively, we believe they should have a good basis for developing some very specific strategic plan with how they intend to spend the remaining 18 months. I don't believe it's going to be possible to do everything, to provide absolute assurance that 22 thousand institutions are going to be absolutely ready. So you need to make some tradeoff decisions. Where are you going to focus your attention, what sort of resources will be needed, do you need to bring in additional resources, do you need to pool resources, do you need to take any sort of extraordinary measures to be ready. I'm not suggesting that banks or thrifts or credit unions are going to fail, but I am suggesting the tasks that will be facing the five regulators is monumental. They're going to have a great deal of information to make better decisions. And I think that it would be of utmost importance that those tradeoffs that they'll be making need to be examined, to be considered, that the decisions be bought into, and then they need to proceed with due diligence. It's going to be a big job. That concludes my summary, Mr. Chairman, and along with Mr. Willemssen, would be happy to respond to your questions.
REP. LEACH : Well, let me begin with one to you, Mr. Brock. The Wall Street Journal had an interesting article last week, saying that banks may be underestimating the losses to the Year 2000 Problem, based not on their own compliance or their vendors compliance, but based upon the customers lack of meeting Year 2000 Problems. And therefore, because their customers can't meet these problems, they may be subject to losses, including legal losses, that is, legal liabilities that could be enormous, and that therefore, they may well have loan loss reserves that they will have to develop because of this issue. Does that strike you as a credible potential, or is that something the GAO has not examined?
MR. BROCK: Yes. We believe that banks have vulnerability in the Year 2000 in two aspects. Is one, will their internal systems be ready? And secondly, is there a potential loss from their customers? So that is the concern. REP. LEACH: Mr. Willemssen, you state, and I want to quote you precisely that, 'at the current pace, it's clear that in not all mission critical systems will be fixed in time', unquote. Based on that statement, you're suggesting that basically some critical government functions will malfunction. What ones do you think are most likely?
MR. WILLEMSSEN: Because of the limited time left, and the fact recognized by many now, recognized by us over a year ago, that not everything can be done in time, we would emphasize establishing priorities based on health, safety, financial impact, national defense, and economic impact. So, it's not to say that we can choose at this point and time which might fail, or which may not. We still have a chance to make those choices. And those are the kind of choices we'd like to see Mr. Koskinen make at this point and time; recognize that we can't fix everything; recognize that low priority systems are not going to get fixed, and let's deal with the most urgent mission critical processes and supporting systems.
REP. LEACH: Well, I think that's fair to suggest that, but where do you think the most likely fall is going to come?
MR. WILLEMSSEN: Well, we've conducted a number of evaluations at a variety of civil agencies, and the progress we've found is quite uneven. For example, at the opposite ends of the spectrum would be on one hand the social security administration, on the other hand thefederal aviation administration; we've evaluated both. SSA has outstanding programs; we still found some risk areas that they've been working at this for 10 years, on the other hand FAA was way behind. They got a late start; they have not progressed as rapidly as they should have. Fortunately, in the past couple months, the administrator has become actively engaged, and now made that a priority. But there too, at the agency, and component agency level, FAA in this case we have to look at setting those priorities and recognizing that not everything can be done in time. REP. LEACH: Returning to the subject of quality qualified workers in this area. We have the general body worker circumstance, we also have those that are available to the government circumstance. Are there any laws that need to be amended to make it easier for OPM to hire former workers, or incentive systems put in place to hire new workers?
MR. WILLEMSSEN: We haven't yet seen a government wide personnel strategy to address the Year 2000. That's one of our recommendations, and one that Mr. Koskinen is in agreement with, and with that recommendation he met with OPM last week. The initial reaction was it may not be necessary to have the legal changes that we may be able to have an exception with this being of a quasi-emergency nature, but I don't think the final word is in on that, what we would encourage is that that kind of evaluation needs to be done ASAP, so that if legal change is required that that kind of proposal can be submitted up here.
REP. LEACH: Let me ask, are you expecting them to make that assessment, or are you going to make it as well? Implying that you might come up with two different assessments, I mean Mr. Koskinen and you. Are you going to make that assessment as well?
MR. WILLEMSSEN: We are recommending that they do the assessment, and my best guess is we will be asked to evaluate that assessment.
REP. LEACH: Let me say you now are asked, say you waited.
MR. WILLEMSSEN: Okay.
REP. LEACH: My long experience at OPM is fairly entranced on flexibility issues. So, I'm not inclined to immediately assume that they will opt for a flexible enough response, and so I hope that you are on top of that very carefully. MR. WILLEMSSEN: Mr. Chairman, if three months from now, we're still asking this same sort of question, then I would be greatly concerned also, because this is not a business as usual situation, it there clearly is a crisis that requires extraordinary measures.
MR. BROCK: Mr. Chairman, may I answer that please.
REP. LEACH: Yes of course, Mr. Brock.
MR. BROCK: We have in effect made that assessment within the regulators that they do not have adequate technical resources; we questioned that. Secondly, when we visited some of the leading financial institutions both banks, trading houses, stock exchanges, and things like that. They've made a determination some time ago, that resources would be critical to making this work, and they have already taken action for the most part for retention bonuses, employment incentives, making long term arrangements with consultants, and contractors to lock them in until the Year 2000 pass. That this is an issue that you have a very, very limited opportunity to take action before available resources that taken away are not available. I think a question that might come up, is that even if the government takes action, will in fact the resources be available the right people, and the right geographic areas to make a big difference.
REP. LEACH: And the right salary levels.
MR. BROCK: Yeah.
REP. LEACH: And again the right anecdotal evidence is major financial institutions are offering salaries that are for entering people that are above the highest paid people in the government in these areas; this is a very serious dilemma. Well I appreciate your comments on this, and I hope that if anyone is still here from Koskinen's office, that they recognize we'll be following this closely too. Mr. LaFalce. REP. LAFALCE: I thank you, Mr. Chairman. We could see the Year 2000 Problems much earlier than the Year 2000. Most people say January of '99, in some instances even earlier, is that correct? MR. BROCK: Yes. REP. LAFALCE: Yes. I was just having a dinner conversation last night with my elderly aunt, and mother, and my very own wife, and something else is going to happen January of '99 came up, and that was the automatic transfer of benefits into some type of account such as social security benefits. And I think it's January of '99 that that must take place, correct me if I'm wrong, staff. REP. LEACH: In fact, I think they've put some flexibility into, they have -- REP. LAFALCE: There's an ability to issue waivers, I know, but I think that's what's called for now. But I'm just curious if the conversions of these two dates, assuming it is January 1st of '99, and the Year 2000 Problem. What are the practical difficulties for somebody who has been receiving his social security check in the mail at home, is now going to receive in his social security check in some depository account given the Year 2000 Problems. Is there any synergy there? MR. WILLEMSSEN: There is a relationship, and the key is before fully implementing such kind of electronic transactions, we've got to make sure and thoroughly test that system to make sure that it works as intended, and including testing for the Year 2000 issue.
REP. LAFALCE: Okay, now let's go into the mind of an 80 year old social security recipient widow, and if somebody were to tell her well there's a Year 2000 Problem. How might that effect that person? You know, you say yes there is a potential problem. But then how would it effect that person?
MR. WILLEMSSEN: If not adequately addressed, it could effect that person in terms of the amount from the check being inaccurate, either too low, or too high. It could effect that --
REP. LAFALCE: Whose check? The governments check that's deposited? MR. WILLEMSSEN: Correct. It could effect the person, by again, depending on a particular transaction that the individual possibly not getting a check at all. REP. LAFALCE: All right. Most of the testimony I've heard, I think has dealt with the issue of prevention of the problem. Yet, it's my gut feeling that no matter what great faith efforts we take, we're going to have a problem, and all we can do is minimize the problem to whatever extents even possible. What do we do to cope with the problem, and are we thinking now about ways to cope with the problems that will surely develop? My question is to what extent would they develop, and is that part of our thinking right now? MR. WILLEMSSEN: It's part of the thinking that beginning to be initiated, I don't know if Mr. Koskinen mentioned it, but one of the contacts he's had in his brief tenure is to contact the head of FEMA to start getting that organization involved with the states because it again in the event that we do have some real -- REP. LAFALCE: Now FEMA usually deals with natural disasters. Would that be the appropriate agency to help cope with this problem? MR.WILLEMSSEN: FEMA has a strong state network, and we must keep in mind that our state and local governments are key players in this Year 2000 issue. They have a large number of information systems; they're in many cases are most common contact with the average citizen. REP. LAFALCE: Is FEMA involved in the prevention efforts in any way right now? MR. WILLEMSSEN: I'm not aware of such involvement, we haven't evaluated that. REP. LAFALCE: Well, I guess one of the questions I would have then is should we go to an agency that's not involved in the preventive efforts for a leadership role in the remedial efforts once the problem surfaces.
MR. WILLEMSSEN: Well, we have to get a large number of a variety of key organizations involved in this, and we favor an approach focused on key economic sectors, whether it's utilities, telecommunications, small business, financial institutions, and get the critical parties together there. The already existing interest groups, and associations for those areas, the lead federal departments and agencies, state and local government, so that together we can address this in a common fashion.
REP. LAFALCE: Which agency of the federal government do you think might be the most knowledgeable on these issues? The Department of Commerce maybe?
MR. WILLEMSSEN: Knowledgeable on what the --
REP. LAFALCE: The Year 2000 Problems.
MR. WILLEMSSEN: Based on our evaluations, and I will let Mr.Brock add to this, based on my evaluations on the civil side of the government, I would say the social security administration, because they started on this program almost 10 years ago.
REP. LAFALCE: Okay. Well I was just thinking of agencies that could take the lead in helping to cope with these problems. The Department of Defense, all defense related. But what about the civilian, the non-defense? My gut reaction is the social security administration would not be an appropriate agency to deal with all them, their goal is to take the lead, but you know --
MR. WILLEMSSEN: I think as it pertains to small business andindividuals, we need to think about actively engaging the Department of Commerce more and the Small Business Administration.
REP. LAFALCE: Well, I should have asked this question earlier of Mr. Koskinen. Now he is the President of the Council of the Year 2000 Conversion, but is the Council made up of Executive Branch Agencies?
MR. WILLEMSSEN: He, as assistant to the President and head of the Council, the Council will have individual representatives from the major federal Departments and Agencies, but those are staff with those Agencies who are just serving on the Council as one of their many duties.
REP. LAFALCE: It would seem to me that there ought to be some federal Agency or Taskforce or operational entity, council or what have you, responsible for the implementation. Right now most everything is Auditory, Advisory, et cetera, but once the problem hits and it's not a question of whether. I think it is, the only question is where, to what extent, but we're going to have to take very, very forceful remedial measures and we'd better start thinking about that now and maybe you at GAO are in a good position. Your report is entitled Strong Leadership Needed to Avoid Disruption of Essential Services, and so it's primarily preventive in nature. Maybe startthinking, to when the problem does hit, how should we respond?
MR. WILLEMSSEN: Yes, sir. If I may mention one other item, we put out a guide last week on contingency planning. Again, somewhat of a preventative measure, but getting closer to what you're addressing, because key elements of that are also what we call a Day Zero or Day One Planning. If and when disaster hits then what are you going to do? And we go through the steps that have to be triggered to implement your backup and contingency plans in that case.
REP. LAFALCE: Thank you.
REP. LEACH: Well thank you, very much. And let me thank youagain, both of you, for your work and for your organization's work. And as you proceed with this work, if you see areas that you think need to be investigated further that you haven't had formal requests, I hope you'll feel free to have a discussion with our office. Also, if you see areas where you think there may be legislation that would be helpful, I'd like to have a standing request that you indicate that. And you can do this formally or informally, as you see fit.
MR. WILLEMSSEN: Yes, sir. All right.
REP. LEACH: But we very much appreciate your efforts and thank you, very much.
WITNESSES: Thank you.
