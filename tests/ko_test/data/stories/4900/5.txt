MONOPOLY 'EXORCISED' INDUSTRY RETURNS TO ITS FREE-MARKET ROOTS OF THE 1890S

Declaring the utility system 'exorcised of monopoly,' California threw open the generation and sale of electricity to bare-knuckle retail competition Tuesday, returning the industry to its free-market roots.
There were few outward signs of the quiet revolution now unfolding, but in Alhambra a new power auction began processing bids to buy and sell electricity. Sell bids, at an average price of 1.97 cents per kilowatt hour, were in the low range of estimates.
In Folsom, a new grid operator threw a party, complete with a four-foot-long cake shaped like a light bulb, to celebrate the fact it would take control of 75 percent of the state's power grid at midnight.
The grid-running Independent System Operator is headquartered just two miles from the now-defunct Folsom Powerhouse that made history on July 13, 1895, when it became the first hydroelectric plant in the nation to supply power to a 'distant' city over high-voltage transmission lines.
The 11,000-volt lines ran 22 miles from the American River generating station to Sacramento where -- as newspapers of the day marveled -- it provided enough juice to power 12,662 incandescent lights, 582 street lamps and 41 miles of electric streetcar tracks. To celebrate the momentous event, 30,000 people thronged Sacramento for a Grand Electric Carnival on Sept. 9, 1895 -- California Admission Day. PG&E retired the plant in 1952.
'Life goes full circle,' said PG&E President Gordon Smith on Tuesday. 'We're back to the bare-knuckle, free-wheeling entrepreneurs. Quite frankly, I think our predecessors would identify more with today's ESPs (electric service providers) than with the monopoly utilities that we became.'
The new market -- consisting of two competing power auctions, 1,300 in-state electric generators, 56 licensed power marketers, half a dozen big utilities and the ISO -- is being trusted to create competition that will hammer down prices and unleash robust innovation.
Over time, existing power houses -- most built in the 1940s through 1970s -- are expected to be replaced by gas-fired plants based on aircraft engine technology that are 40 percent more fuel-efficient. Micro-generators may again proliferate on the edges of transmission corridors.
Creativity, innovation
'I think we'll see creativity and innovation that we can't even dream of today,' said Greg Conlon, a member of the state Public Utilities Commission.
Rather than set rates through complex rate proceedings -- the last rate case for Southern California Edison ran 60,000 pages -- the market will set prices. Only power delivery will remain a regulated enterprise. For the first time in decades, the market -- not regulators -- will determine whether to pay the price for renewable power and whether new plants built.
'This is the beginning of the period where consumers determine what the energy services industry will be,' said Elena Schmid, an ISO board member and director of the PUC's Office of Ratepayer Advocates. 'Today opens that door.'
Originally, California deregulation was to have begun on Jan. 1, but glitches in the computer systems used by the ISO and the California Power Exchange forced a delay until Tuesday.
In the interim, tiny Rhode Island became the first state to offer complete choice to all its residents. 'It's true, we're the size of some pilot programs, but we're still a state,' said Bob McCabe, president of Narragansett Electric Co. in Providence, R.I.
Unlike California, Rhode Island mandated a set price for electricity for consumers who don't elect to shop the market. The price starts at 3.2 cents per kilowatt hour and rises to 5 cents during the next decade. Consumers alsopay a power delivery or 'distribution' fee.
In California, the state-sanctioned Power Exchange will run a daily auction, as will the rival Automated Power Exchange in San Jose, a privately financed venture that has gotten some money from Bechtel Corp.
It is expected to take weeks before the market reveals its pricing patterns. In addition to a market price, consumers will pay a fee for power delivery and a fee to pay off past utility investments.
A new market
'This is a new market and it doesn't mean much to talk about prices yet,' said Ed Cazalet, chief executive of the Automated Power Exchange. 'I think this is a grand experiment and you have to applaud California for trying.'
In the ISO's control room, where the walls are ringed by giant lighted map boards showing the transmission grid, computer operators Terry Meyer and Tim Van Blaricom Tuesday endured a procession of visitors with good humor but apparent eagerness to get down to business. Operational control was to be switched to the Folsom center at midnight from the three big investor-owned utilities -- Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric Co.
Meyer, who joined the ISO from San Diego Gas and Electric, said months of nearly around-the-clock testing got tiresome.
'Throw me in the water. I'm tired of swimming lessons and first aid classes,' said Meyer, a generation dispatcher. He kidded Van Blaricom, saying, 'Tim, here, was so tired of tests he said he was looking forward to having his wisdom teeth pulled so he wouldn't have to sit through any more.'
The reaction of executives and board members was more exuberant.
Incredible high
Jeffrey Tranen, the MIT-trained engineer who gave up the presidency of New England Power Co. in Massachusetts to head the ISO, said Tuesday's start-up was 'nothing short of an incredible high. . . . This job is the culmination of everything I've worked for for 27 years.'
For Jan Smutny-Jones, chairman of the ISO board, the day symbolized the triumph of the market and independent power producers over utilities.
Smutny-Jones is head of the Independent Energy Producers Association in Sacramento, which waged a 15-year battle to force utilities to buy their power and put it on the grid. It took California its first baby steps toward a free marketplace.
'The utility system has been exorcised of monopoly,' said a jubilant Smutny-Jones.
'We did it!'
