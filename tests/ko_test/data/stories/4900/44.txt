U.S. consumers are watching California to see how successful its deregulation will be.
California regulators signed the final papers Monday opening the state's $ 23 billion electricity market to competition.
The regulators' action was one of two hurdles removed from the planned start of deregulation today. The heads of the state's largest utilities also assured federal regulators that the state's system for transmitting power can handle deregulation without blackouts.
Computer glitches plagued two agencies set up to handle the movement of electricity, preventing the state from starting competition Jan.1 as originally planned.
Both the California Independent System Operator and California Power Exchange, the state agencies that will oversee power transmission and pricing, now say they are ready for deregulation.
California is being closely watched as U.S. consumers who buy $ 230 billion in electricity annually gain the right to choose their supplier over the next few years. California is one of the first states to move to complete deregulation. Virginia lawmakers this month sent the governor a bill to establish a timetable for retail competition to begin in 2002 and be completed by 2004.
In a competitive electric market, qualified marketing companies buy and sell power for their customers and deliver the electricity over the transmission system. The marketing company pays a fee, much like a highway toll, to the utilities for using their high-voltage lines. This system is supposed to lower prices by creating consumer-level competition.
California's major utilities have agreed to sell power plants to encourage competition by providing new competitors with their own sources of electricity.
