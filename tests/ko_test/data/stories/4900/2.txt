Written Testimony of David McIntyre, Jr. President and CEO, TriWest Healthcare Alliance before the Senate Armed Services Committee Personnel Subcommittee March 11, 1998 Introductory Comments Mr. Chairman, and distinguished members of the Senate Armed Services Committee Personnel Subcommittee, I would like to thank you for this opportunity to appear before your committee on the subject of the implementation of TRICARE. My name is David McIntyre. I am the President and CEO of TriWest Healthcare Alliance, the prime contractor for the TRICARE Central Region. I come before you today on behalf of TriWest's fourteen locally- based owners, five subcontractors and more than 600 employees. It is a particularly unique pleasure for me to appear before you today, as my history with this Committee goes back some time. During my seven year stint on the staff of one of this Committee's members, Senator John McCain, I had many opportunities to work with this Committee in helping to shape health policy related to the Department of Defense and its programs. I would like to thank Senator McCain and this Committee for the opportunity to contribute to the health policy in this area and for the opportunity to develop a vision of this program which I am now able to employ in the marketplace - a vision which was inherent in the very creation of TriWest and how we carry out our business today. Mr. Chairman, TriWest is pleased to have the honor to not only serve many of the beneficiaries of your state, but those of several others on this Committee Arizona, Kansas and New Mexico. Unique Nature of the Central Region The Central Region is unique among the TRICARE regions in a couple of ways. - First, it is the largest geographic land mass of any of the TRICARE regions. Our Region constitutes nearly one-third of the land mass of the continental United States. - Second, it is a Region composed of a significant number of very rural or remote states - states which have historically been 'medically underserved'. - And, third, our Region is the only one that represents the entire spectrum of the health care delivery system, from Wyoming with no managed care to Minnesota which is recognized as having the highest managed care penetration in the country. From this microcosm of the country's health care delivery system, one observes close up the reality that 'all health care is local'. This leads to the principle that because system change is in part cultural and traditional, change will come at 'different paces for different places.' In my view, therein lies the genius of TRICARE. TriWest Healthcare Alliance is a closely held corporation which was formed for the express purpose of bidding on and administering the TRICARE contract for what is now the Central Region. TriWest is owned by eleven Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, two University Hospitals and a for-profit HMO, all of which hail from the geographic area which comprises the Central Region. In Arizona, our owner is Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona. In Idaho, our owner is the former Blue Shield Plan of Idaho - now called Regence of Idaho. In Kansas, our owner is Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas. And, in New Mexico, our owner is the University of New Mexico. Most of the health care entities that own TriWest have been serving the health care coverage needs of the communities in which they are located for more than fifty years. In addition to owning the corporation, they are responsible for building and managing the provider networks in their areas. Today, in addition to the 735,000 TRICARE beneficiaries from the Central Region, these fourteen prominent local health care entities serve the health care coverage needs of some 11 million residents from the geographic area comprising the Region. Hence, they are not strangers to this Region. While some may look at these contracts as solely a business opportunity, I believe that these contracts represent a higher obligation. The fact is, those of us who hold these contracts share in our nation's obligation to meet the health care needs of those who have or are currently dedicating their lives to protecting our freedom. This obligation extends not only to the active duty and retired, but also to their dependents. This obligation is reinforced during a time such as this, when sailors, soldiers, airmen and marines are being asked to step into harm's way as the buildup continues the gulf. As I meet with the Line and Wing Commanders from across our Region I am constantly reminded of the fact that the readiness of the troops is tied in large part to the emotional security of their families and the feeling that the needs of their loved ones are going to be taken care while they are away. And, health care ranks at the top of the list. Prior to addressing the implementation of our contract, and where we still have some challenges, I would like to focus on the goals of this program because I believe it gives us some frame of reference as to why we are even engaged in this business called TRICARE. Goals of TRICARE As one who was present on Capitol Hill at the inception of the Champus Reform Initiative, the development of the TRICARE program, and when the direction was given that it be implemented across the country, I viewed the goals as being summed up in four words: access, quality, cost and trust. I believe these were the right goals then and they are the right goals now. Quite frankly, they are the same four areas of focus demanding the attention of health care organizations throughout America today as they seek to meet the health care needs of the population at large. I would like to briefly speak to each of these goals. Access The first goal of the TRICARE program is to enhance access to needed services and care for beneficiaries in both the direct care and civilian systems. With regard to access, I would like to focus on four specific areas: supporting the Military Treatment Facility (MTF) in its mission, building a network, creating enhanced benefits in the area of health and wellness, and providing access to administrative support. Every military family today is faced with two inexorable realities that threaten access. Unfortunately, neither are likely to improve in the near future. The first is the rapid change in health care systems, technology and services across America which constantly challenges health care providers, practices, organization and financing. The second reality is the accelerating pace of change in the DoD resources and force structure needs which is forcing the realignment, downsizing or closing of MTF's. In the midst of all this, however, the nation must still prepare for the reality of missions, such as the current build up in the gulf. The need for a contractor to marshal the necessary resources from the private sector in a systematic and coherent fashion. One of the unique attributes of these contracts is that it is our responsibility to assist in back filling the gaps left in the direct care system as resources are pulled out of that environment in times of conflict, a responsibility that we are in the process of responding to in communities across our Region. Many of you will recall the confusion and complications generated in both the medical community and the direct care system during Desert Storm/Desert Shield when there was a less than coherent approach to addressing these needs. This feature of these contracts was designed to respond to the realities of contingencies and mobilizations. Supporting the MTFs in their Mission Our first obligation is to support the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) as they carry out their mission. The specifics vary from MTF to MTF. With some MTF's, we are responsible for placing a provider of a particular specialty in the MTF in order to maximize the personnel and infrastructure investment the taxpayers have made in the direct care system. In other MTF's, we are responsible for carrying out an appointment making function so that the scarce resources of that MTF can be channeled into another critical area. For other MTF's, we are responsible for building a network of civilian providers and institutions in order to create capacity that does not exist in the MTF so that a full array of health care services are available to the TRICARE beneficiaries in a given community. In still other MTF's, we are responsible for providing utilization management services for the direct care system. From the examples, one can easily see why these are called 'Managed Care Support' contracts. The issues I have just highlighted, in my view, point to the need for a contract of this type versus a program that merely relies on a standard insurance product offered to commercial or government employees or retirees to meet their health care needs. Building a Network Our second obligation is the development of a network with a compliment of providers to meet the private sector health care delivery needs of the beneficiary population. In less than a year, TriWest has enlisted more than 22,000 providers and 500 institutions in our network. If there are providers in a given geographic area of our Region, we have a portion or all of them signed up as part of the network. On balance, our network development efforts have been a success. Having said that, however, we are still 27 providers short of a complete network in our Region. This is due to the fact that in our Region certain providers simply won't sign a contract, not even at 100 percent of the CHAMPUS Maximum Allowable Charge set by the government. In a couple of areas where this is the case, we have been able to convince providers from a neighboring community to circuit ride through the area on a periodic basis and service the needs of the beneficiaries. But we must together face the fact that in sparsely populated areas of the country where there are a few health care providers and/or few CHAMPUS beneficiaries the current approach to maximum allowable charge rates isn't and probably won't work. In fact, this situation is a mirror image of what is happening with Medicare in those same communities. I know that this is an area of focus for the Department of Defense, as it has been for you and your colleagues on the House National Security Committee and I would encourage you not to give up your focus on this issue. Rather than spending more time on this issue at this point, I would like to get into it in greater detail later in my testimony. Enhanced Benefits Our third obligation is to make sure that the TRICARE program, specifically the HMO-like Prime option, offers beneficiaries health and wellness benefits not heretofore available under CHAMPUS. We at TriWest have worked hard to ensure that the Prime option in our Region meets this test. Many of the beneficiaries I come into contact with find these benefits to be of great value. Access to Administrative Support Our fourth obligation is to provide administrative services and support. One of the critical elements in this area is the requirement to develop TRICARE Service Centers at or proximal to each catchment area. These service centers are responsible for assisting beneficiaries in answering their questions about the program, assisting in the enrollment process, and help them in locating a provider and/or scheduling an appointment. In part, because we have an obligation to assist the MTF in its mission, we at TriWest asked the MTFs in our Region to allow us to place the service centers in their facilities. I am pleased that the MTF's agreed with our request. This has ensured that the services are accessible to the beneficiaries who visited or lived close to the MTF. Quality The second goal of the program is to help providers and beneficiaries focus on and enhance the quality of health care and services. The issue of quality has been a significant focus lately, both within the direct care system and in the private sector at large. While the Department of Defense direct care system, like any other, has certainly had its challenges in this critical area from time to time, I believe that there are few systems currently more focused on quality today than the Department of Defense. Not only is the DoD focused on the issue of improving quality within the direct care system, a focus further strengthened with the recently released initiative, but the DoD has also imposed an extensive set of quality-specific requirements in the TRICARE contracts. - First, the DoD expects those of us who are contractors under this program to have a quality management function that focuses on the enhancement of quality in the health care provided to beneficiaries in our respective region(s). And, they have strict standards and processes in place to ensure that we do so. - Second, the DoD and the beneficiaries of the program expect that the providers we bring into our networks are of the highest quality, and standards are in place to ensure that this is the case as well. - And, third, the DoD has built into these contracts very specific procedures for handling grievances and appeals. On the issue of appeals in particular, which has been a hot topic in the media lately with regard to private sector health plans, the DoD requires us to provide the beneficiaries with a third-party source that is completely independent from the contractors to which a utilization decision can be appealed there is disagreement. This provides the beneficiaries with a layer of protection that is not found in many commercial health plans today. All of these provisions are designed to assure the highest level of quality in the care and services that are provided to the beneficiaries of this program. Cost The issue of cost is not simple and has several dimensions. - First, competitive bidding of the TRICARE contracts lowers price and provides the DoD with some predictability in this area. As you know, the program was created in part to stem the rising cost of CHAMPUS by bringing in private sector contractors to assist in the management of the services and care that are provided to its beneficiaries. On this point alone, the program has been a success. The mere awarding of the contracts brings a lowering in the cost of care provided over what would have otherwise been incurred under the CHAMPUS program, in that the contract prices have been below that projected under CHAMPUS. - Second, the risk corridors inherent in the health care financing portion of the contracts limit exposure. What's more, the contracts bring with them a fixed administrative price. Those companies that choose to compete for these contracts engage in an aggressive bidding process in which price is a critical determinant of success. - Third, this program limits beneficiary cost sharing. Although there is an enrollment fee for those retirees and their families who choose to enroll in the Prime program, the cost- shares for these beneficiaries are reduced significantly. This means that the out-of-pocket exposure to the Prime beneficiaries is limited, a feature that is attractive to many of the beneficiaries with whom I have come into contact. - Fourth, the contracts impose maximum charge limits which is complicating some network development efforts as providers are not willing to sing up due to the aggressiveness of the limits, known as CMA, set by Congress and the DoD. The difficulty is that there are currently areas of the country, including some in the Central Region, where providers are unwilling to accept even II 5 percent of CMAC as payment in full for services. Thus they opt not to participate in the program. What many of them have said is that it would take reimbursement at upwards of 140 percent to get them to participate. I might offer that similar things are happening with Medicare in these same areas. More likely than not, this occurs in areas where there are a limited number of providers and a fairly small number of Medicare and TRICARE beneficiaries. From a policy perspective, this is a tough issue because these providers are willing to forgo this patient population due to the fact that it represents a fairly small portion of their patient mix. In my view, the latter issue could serve as one of the greatest threats to both Medicare and TRICARE if it ends up being anything more than an exception to the rule. It is something which we are seeing in the more remote areas of our Region and is quite frankly an issue that I would encourage all of you to monitor closely. After all, it has a direct impact on both access and cost and serves as a threat to the financial well-being of the beneficiaries of this program. Trust The fourth goal is building trust with the beneficiaries. Historically, the beneficiary population had been provided access to care in the military treatment facility community on demand. This is going away. And, with this entrance of constraints on access to the system and the support provided by private sector contractors, there is a risk of mistrust of the beneficiary population. The fact is, for most beneficiaries, the TRICARE program is an improvement over what they had previously. Educating them of this fact and building trust that they are going to be well served is a delicate, but critical matter. A substantial part of building trust is listening and acting on those things that are within one's control. As we at TriWest strive for constant improvement, one of the things that we pay very close attention to is the concerns of our customers - particularly those of the beneficiaries and those who represent them. We use a variety of tools to solicit and receive this feedback. - First, we pay attention to the formal beneficiary satisfaction survey information. These surveys, which are distributed for the program at large, and are just now beginning to be released for our Region. They point to the fact that on balance the beneficiaries are satisfied with the program and the level of service being provided. - Second, at the very start of our operation we established a group of beneficiary advisory boards that we meet with regularly. In order to ensure that we were receiving a broad cross section of feedback, we established one here in Washington (that is composed of representatives of the beneficiary associations) and a number of them across the Region (which are composed of those who utilize the system in our Region). These advisory boards not only provide us with the opportunity to solicit feedback, but give us the ability convey information critical to the contract. On more than one occasion, an advisory board has provided us with feedback to help improve the program or our own performance. One recent example was a suggestion on how we might alter the design of the envelope in which we were mailing the reenrollment materials to ensure that beneficiaries did not think it was junk mail and toss it out. Of course, we promptly made the change. In addition, we have used these groups to test market materials and messages to ensure that they will be understood by the beneficiary population at large. We have appreciated the willingness of the beneficiary community to participate in these groups and have found the input invaluable. - Third, we track the formal complaints that come in directly from beneficiaries and through Congressional inquiries. We also provide people with an opportunity to submit comments and suggestions into a box at the TRICARE Service Centers. - With few exceptions, I believe that most beneficiaries of the program in our Region would say that they are better off today than they were prior to the implementation of this contract. Indeed, this was validated in a recent conversation that our Lead Agent had with the MTF Commanders of our Region when the vast majority of them responded that this was the case. Implementation of Central Region Contract I would now like to specifically turn to the implementation of the TRICARE contract in the Central Region. On balance. I believe the implementation of our contract has gone well. However, we have certainly had and continue to have a few challenges. Implementation of a contract of this size and complexity is not easy or uncomplicated. We were required and agreed to set up a very large insurance plan in a very compressed period of time. And, try as one might to avoid glitches, there have been some. Where we have found those that we were unable to avoid through solid planning, our approach has been to aggressively and quickly tackle those issues and bring them to a swift and effective resolution. I believe that is exactly what we have done. Marketing Effort One of our early successes was the local marketing effort that was carried out in concert with the MTFs. Most of the MTFs in the region recognized the importance of their involvement and were an integral part of the marketing effort. The success of the local marketing effort is perhaps best demonstrated by the facts. In the first two months of the program we exceeded the first year's enrollment projection of 172,000 beneficiaries. Ten months into the program, we have enrolled more than 325,000 beneficiaries - which is a large number than our contract projected for the full five years. This is good news and bad news. On the positive side, it is a reflection of the fact that beneficiaries find value in the program and that is saving both the beneficiaries and the taxpayer money. On the negative side, it has taxed TriWest's systems and people beyond belief. While the local marketing effort has been a success, we have been somewhat challenged when it comes to regional marketing. Quite frankly, it seems to me that what is really needed is not marketing but education. The level of knowledge about the program on the part of the beneficiary population at large, the military and private sector providers, those who work in the direct care system and our own employees is not yet where we hoped it would be. This is, however, a new and complex program that is dramatically different from what many have been exposed to in the past. In my opinion, the only way to effectively educate the beneficiary population, particularly the active duty members and their families, is to do it in concert with their peers who are still in uniform. We are working closely with our counterparts in the Department of Defense to achieve success in this area as we renew the local marketing push. Telephone Assistance Early on in the contract, we had difficulty handling the level of phone calls coming into the company from people who had questions or wanted assistance with filling out their forms or understanding how to access the system. Keep in mind, this is the first time that TRICARE had been implemented in the Central Region. We quickly wrapped our arms around this problem, and in a matter of several weeks took the average wait times for a phone call to one of our service centers or to our central call center from 45 minutes down to within the contract standard of two minutes. While we occasionally face challenges due to a spike in the number of calls, this problem has for all intensive purposes been resolved. The Colorado Springs Experience Early in our contract we were faced with a challenge from a large group of providers in Colorado Springs that wanted to terminate its contract as a network provider. This didn't mean that the group would no longer see TRICARE, beneficiaries. It just meant that the group would no longer be a part of our network. They complained about the slowness in getting lab results and other critical information from the MTFs they claimed that the utilization management requirements of the program are antiquated. And they complained about slowness in the payment for services. While we had the legal right to keep them locked into the contract, we felt this would be counterproductive. Thus, we agreed to let them out of the contract with a transition period that would allow us to rebuild the network. While this was a painful time for all concerned, I am pleased to report that with one or two exceptions we did maintain the bulk of the network prior to when the group dropped out by contracting with individual providers and bringing in circuit riders from the University of Colorado. We also went to work immediately on their complaints. The issue of timely information flow from the MTFs was quickly brought to resolution. On the issue of utilization management, we joined with the Lead Agent in designing utilization management changes that will make the program more effective. Our proposal has been approved by Health Affairs and we are currently working with the contracting staff to iron out the final details of the effect on our contract prior to implementation. We believe the changes will be a dramatic improvement in the eyes of the providers participating in the program and ensure that the resources are applied in a more effective manner to ensure the maximization of quality and cost. In the future, we will attempt to underlay our group contracts with individual provider contracts. This will prevent groups from moving in mass and complicating the stability of the network. It is informative that a couple of the most vocal providers who drove the group's decision to get out of the contract have now contacted us expressing interest in coming back into the network. Adverse Impact of Maximum Charge Limits It has taken us more time than expected to bring our network to completion in a couple of areas of our Region. One of these areas, as you know Mr. Chairman, is in and around the Air Base at Mountain Home. Part of the issue is a shortage of providers in that area, but wherein there are providers, some will not contract even at 100% of the government authorized maximum reimbursement rate. We have done about all we can do on our own, and I have asked the Department of Defense to assist us by doing a review of the sufficiency of a couple of the rates as they apply to that area. It is our collective hope that we will be able to bring the network in that area to completion in the near future. Claims Volume In addition to the extraordinarily high level of enrollment at TriWest, we have incurred a level of claims that is some forty percent higher than anticipated. The unexpected volume, coupled with the challenges of trying to get a new staff and providers educated to aspects of processing claims that are significantly different under this program than others they had been involved with historically, and the complexity of the claims processing requirements themselves, led to our claims processing falling behind. In my view, timely and accurate payment of legitimate claims for services that have been rendered is imperative. What's more, with the aggressive reimbursement rates of this program, It is absolutely critical. Claims payments that are not accurate or delayed unnecessarily cost everyone money and only lead to unnecessary hassle for all concerned -- particularly the providers and beneficiaries. A great deal of work has been and is being done in this area. Currently, however, our claims processing is being conducted within the contractually required standards. While we are now functioning within the contract standards, we are working to further improve the performance in this critical area, for it is our view that timely and accurate payment of claims is not a goal - it is an imperative. In addition to working with our staff to continually enhance their education and training in this area, we are working with the provider community to enhance their understanding of how to properly file a claim. We are also beginning to work with many of them to get them hooked up to our claims processor in an electronic fashion to speed up the payment of claims. Having said all of this, we are still going to encounter those providers who for one reason or another have a problem getting their claims paid. To ensure that these issues are worked quickly and effectively, we are enhancing our staff in the new claims unit that we built to add a couple of individuals whose sole focus will be to work with providers who are having difficulty in this area. Again, on balance, I believe that the implementation of our contract has been a success. While certainly not without its challenges, we have tackled these challenges aggressively and brought them under control very quickly. I believe it is important for all of us to remember that this program represents a substantial change. And change is rarely trouble free or devoid of a certain level of confusion which leads people to be frustrated. Setting the proper level of expectations, however, is critical. One of these expectations is in the area of errors or complaints. Errors are going to occur. What is striking to me is that in the private sector a well run health plan is said to have an error rate of between two and three percent. We hope to be judged as a well run health plan, but I have to tell you that two to three percent of 750,000 people is a large number. Thus, the focus in my view has to be on constant improvement and aggressively tackling those problems that do arise. Partnering with DoD One of the things that I believe has made our contract an overall success to date is the partnering approach that has been pursued by both the government and TriWest. We have both acknowledged the interdependency that is necessary for this program to succeed and we have resolved many issues that could have otherwise presented additional complications. COL Steve Phurrough, the Central Region Lead Agent, and I have separate roles and responsibilities under the program, however, we have developed an effective working relationship. We and our staffs work together closely to coordinate the implementation of various puts of the program and resolve issues posing a challenge in the region. We meet regularly with our staffs to review the progress of the contract in the Region and address those issues that could complicate our success. We don't always agree on issues, but we take the time to listen and share viewpoints - a practice that is crucial in a program that is intent on blending the best of the military and private sector health care concepts. The same is true with regard to ourselves and the individuals at Health Affairs and the newly designated TRICARE Management Activity. I have been particularly impressed at the aggressiveness of these individuals in tackling those problems that are brought to their attention. I believe there is truly a commitment to make this program work to its maximum potential. The reason why partnering is so critical is that we all have a role in making this program a success. And, the historically strained relationships between the contractor and the government only lead to strife and difficulty, proving a diversion from achieving success for the beneficiary. We have dedicated ourselves to doing what we can to make sure that we don't have such a relationship in the Central Region and are pleased that the government has reciprocated. This does not mean that we don't have issues on both sides, but we work through this issues together. Central Region Initiatives A number of significant initiatives have grown out of the partnering effort in our Region. - We are the first Region in which the Lead Agents have been consolidated. This allowed the DoD to reduce the administrative overhead of managing our Region and eased the communication between the government and TriWest, as there is now one rather than two Lead Agents. We are also the first Region to be managed by a full-time Lead Agent, who is also a non-flag grade officer. I have to.say that, from my vantage point, COL Steve Phurrough has filled this role with distinction. - Early on in our network development efforts we made the DoD aware of duplicative provider credentialing requirements. Their response was to work with us to bring about a more rational and less duplicative approach. This approach has preserved the necessary elements to ensure that we were contracting with quality providers, but eliminated a needless hassle that was serving as a deterrent to some well qualified and respected providers deciding to join the network. - The initiative to reengineer the utilization management approach being taken in the Central Region in both the direct care system and in the network is an example of partnering at its best. When implemented, it will minimize the unnecessary hassles that providers encounter when we have to review items which are almost always going to be approved. Instead, our energies and resources will be channeled to the areas where our utilization work can have an appreciable positive effect on quality, access and cost of care. - Partnering has also been evidenced in the area of claims processing. We have been working together with the DoD to ascertain what elements of the claims processing challenges are within TriWest's and/or our claims processor's control and what elements need to be addressed directly by the DoD. I applaud the DoD's aggressiveness in recognizing the fact that there are issues related to claims processing that are within their control that need attention and commend them for beginning the implementation of some of these ideas. Opportunity The TriWest Alliance is nearing completion of its first year of serving military families. We are meeting or exceeding the goals set for us in our contract, by our partners at the DoD, and those that we set for ourselves. We are especially pleased by the large enrollment of beneficiaries, which is positive for both the beneficiaries and the taxpayer. As we near the beginning of our second year, we are refining our operations. But as an alliance of community-based health plans and universities, we are not satisfied with simply meeting or exceeding our contract goals. At a time of serious change in health access and delivery systems in America, we believe it is our responsibility to seek opportunities to enhance care, services and satisfaction of beneficiaries and to help policy makers and administrators to rationalize the public financing of health, medical and long-term care. So we are particularly excited about two initiatives that are on the horizon. For me, both of these initiatives complete the circle of issues that I started working on years ago when I was on Capitol Hill. First, is the implementation of the Medicare Subvention demonstration. TriWest is pleased that Colorado Springs was named as one of the sites and are looking forward to working with the Lead Agent and the MTF's in Colorado Springs to make this critical project a success. We hope that Colorado Springs will also be one of the sites identified for the Medicare Partners program, which permits a commercial Medicare HMO to contract with the MTF's. Second, is a demonstration project TriWest is implementing with the Menninger Clinic from Kansas. The purpose of this demonstration, which was recently authorized by Congress, is to test the hypothesis that there is value in providing wrap around services to those specified in the current mental health benefit. This project is a particular pleasure for me, as several years ago I was responsible for working with your Committee and the DoD in drafting legislation for the first major reengineering of the CHAMPUS mental health benefit. This demonstration project is one of the pieces of unfinished business from that effort. And, third, is an area that is of common interest to a number of the members of this Committee and myself. That is, how we accomplish greater coordination between the Department of Defense and VA health care programs. Following the award of our contract, I had the occasion to meet with Dr. Ken Kaiser from the VA to discuss some possibilities for working together and was pleased with his response. To date, we have a number of VA hospitals signed up a part of our network. In addition, there are sharing agreements between the VA and DoD that are being implemented in our Region. Personally, I applaud these efforts as I believe they will result in maximizing the investment that the taxpayers have made in both systems. I believe, however, that there is more that can be done. To this end, I have taken great interest in the efforts of a number of members on this Committee to address this issue, particularly the work being done through the leadership of the distinguished ranking member, Senator Cleland. During the coming months, the 600 plus members of the TriWest Alliance staff will be alert and responsive to other opportunities with which we may be presented by the unique size, diverse culture and make-up of our Region and the suggestions that come from the experiences of our enrolled beneficiaries, from the providers in the many communities in the 16 states of the Central Region. Concluding Comments In conclusion, while TRICARE is admittedly a complicated program, I believe that its goals are as valid today as they were the day that Congress authorized its implementation. While we at times wish that things were much more simple, part of the complexity of this program is derived from the complexity of the military medical system - much of which is needed given the nature and mission of that system. I would suggest that while there have been some bumps and bruises along the way, and some certainly still exist, the TRICARE program is proving to be a success. It is enhancing access and quality and helping to contain costs. As with any program, there is room for improvement and we must continue to press forward to achieve improvement. What has particularly impressed me as I have moved from a role in the policy-making process to the operational side of things is how much of a partner the DoD wishes to be with the contractors under this program. They appreciate the fact that an effective partnership is critical if the program is to be a success. More than that, we work together daily to find ways to make the system better and more responsive to the needs of the beneficiaries and the taxpayers. While keeping in mind always our mutual obligation to national security preparedness. If a true partnership can be sustained, which I believe it can based on my experience, this will ultimately be a very successful program. As you grapple with the question of whether the system needs minor or major changes as we move through the next year or two, I would hope that you would remember that TRICARE represents a major change. Change is never easy or without its challenges (and I have discussed some of those today). Ultimately, I believe that the change represented by this program will be recognized as a change for the better and the program will continue to be a success in meeting the goals of access, quality and cost. Again, thank you for the invitation to appear before your committee to discuss the implementation of TRICARE. I now look forward to answering any questions that you might have.
