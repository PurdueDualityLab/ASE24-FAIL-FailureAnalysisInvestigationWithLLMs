The millennium glitch affects your business customers' creditworthiness
By now you know that the Year 2000 problem, if not properly addressed, could seriously disrupt your bank's operations. Regulators require you to focus on the Year 2000 problem, a globally pervasive glitch affecting date-sensitive computer programs. Regulators also expect that you have assessed your bank's situation and have developed action plans, leaving at least 12 months to test any programming fixes that might be necessary. And you have to make sure your thirdparty vendors will remain reliable, viable business partners beyond Dec. 31, 1999.
But the Year 2000 problem doesn't end there for banks. It involves more than your bank's automated operations; it also involves the operations of your bank's commercial borrowers. You should be periodically checking the efforts of Year 2000 compliance by your commercial borrowers. Business disruptions could be significant for your corporate borrowers if they fail to address this issue properly. The Year 2000 problem may interfere with business tasks as fundamental as servicing clients, tracking billing records or acquiring products to sell. If corporate borrowers are not prepared for Year 2000, it could damage their creditworthiness.
As a result, regulators warn that additional credit risk is created by business customers who fail to resolve their Year 2000 problems. And some estimates predict that Year 2000 credit risk may be substantial. At least one study predicts that half of all businesses will suffer Year 2000 problems on or shortly after the new millennium.
The Year 2000 problem came about decades ago when software programmers, to save expensive memory space at the time, used two digits rather than four to represent years in date-sensitive calculations. With older applications, including many basic operating systems, the year 1998 is represented by the number 98. Such computers and software may read "00" two-digit date fields for 2000 as 1900.
Loan officers, when making their credit analysis, may want to consider looking at the borrowers' Year 2000 conversion efforts and the potential for significant operational problems to occur because their computer systems are not in compliance. You may also want to include Year 2000 compliance language in your loan documentation and include a formal questionnaire into underwriting criteria.
On the bright side, you can look at assessing your corporate borrowers as a business opportunity. Not only will you be better able to estimate your bank's potential credit risk, you can also provide a service to your customers by increasing their Year 2000 awareness.
The following is a list of a few broad questions your loan officers should consider when assessing the Year 2000 readiness of business customers, both current and prospective.
Are your business customers aware of the Year 2000 problem, and do they understand how it could affect their business? Do they have a detailed, comprehensive plan to identify and fix serious programming problems?
Do your business customers have financial resources and staff to address potential Year 2000 problems? Have they budgeted sufficient resources to fix any problems in time?
Do your business customers rely on outsourced vendors for billing, payroll processing and collections? Have your business customers determined the impact of the Year 2000 problem on internal and third- party systems on which they rely? Are you satisfied that their vendors are Year 2000 ready?
Have your business customers determined the impact the Year 2000 problem will have on their delivery systems? What about their telecommunications systems?
Have your business customers considered the effect of the Year 2000 problem on systems that rely indirectly on computers, such as heating and ventilation controls, elevators and facsimile machines?
Have your business customers assigned the overall responsibility of their Year 2000 efforts to a senior manager?
Have your business customers established a schedule with target dates to complete any Year 2000 reprogramming? Will reprogramming deadlines be monitored regularly by senior managers?
Do your business customers' plans call for any reprogramming work on critical computer systems to be largely finished by Dec. 31, 1998? Will testing of those critical systems be well underway by that year- end date?
Examiners plan to finish reviewing the soundness of all banks' Year 2000 compliance efforts by the end of June 1998. Part of their evaluation involves how well banks have determined and handled the Year 2000 credit risk of their major borrowers.
Having your bank's computer operations ready for the Year 2000 is crucial. But that is only part of the challenge. Your customers need to be ready too.
Remember that addressing the Year 2000 problem requires time, money and technical know-how. And the deadline to fix the problem- Jan. 1, 2000-is immovable. Time is ticking away. These imperatives may require your bank to become an advocate for some of your business customers on this issue. Make sure they understand how important it is to them. They may thank you come New Year's Day 2000.
