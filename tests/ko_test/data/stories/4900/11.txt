WASHINGTON, April 1 /U.S. Newswire/ -- Following was released today by the U.S. Small Business Administration:
Small-business ownersconcerned that their computers will malfunction as the year turns to 2000 were urged this week to look to the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) for help.
The newly appointed headof the president's council dealing with what's known as the "millennium bug," or Y2K issue, praised the "great things" the SBA is doing to help small businesses meet the Y2K challenge. Experts are concerned that on Jan. 1, 2000, many computers will recognize "double zero" not as 2000 but as 1900. The glitch could cause them to stop running or to start generating erroneous data.
"My visit to the SmallBusiness Administration," said John Koskinen, "was among the most encouraging I have had thus far, because here is an agency that really is doing some great things in terms of outreach." Koskinen was selected only last month to head up the President's Council on the Year 2000 Conversion, and has been visiting various federal agencies for briefings since that time.
Koskinen on Tuesdayjoined several federal officials, including SBA Administrator Aida Alvarez, in a White House event to discuss the status of federal efforts to deal with the Y2K situation.
Administrator Alvarezsaid, "Today we are reaching out to the nation's 23 million small businesses. Now and in the months ahead, we will provide small-business owners with balanced and accurate information they need to make informed decisions on how to deal with their particular Y2K problems."
The administratordemonstrated the easy availability of SBA's Web page, which contains vital information on the millennium issue. The agency's site is located at http://www.sba.gov[http://www.sba.gov], with a link to the Y2K area clearly marked on the opening page.
Administrator Alvarezsuggested that all business owners concerned with the millennium issue conduct a self-test of their computer systems, initiate a plan of action and keep informed. She said SBA plans to launch a comprehensive public outreach effort on the Y2K issue later this year.
