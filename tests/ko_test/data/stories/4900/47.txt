REP. KASICH: Mr. Chairman, we are waiting for John Spratt -- as soon as he gets here. No refinancing for him, being late you know.
MR. GREENSPAN: (?) He gets a penalty fee.
REP. KASICH: Closing -- big closing costs.
(Waiting for Ranking Member Spratt.)
REP. KASICH: Mr. Chairman, we'll go ahead and get started. I mean, the only regret I would -- the only concern I would have in starting is that I'd then have to let McDermott make the opening statement. But he'll behave himself -- no, he's a good buy.
Well, Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for taking the time to come -- yeah, I'm not going to put that to a vote. (Laughter.) Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for coming because maybe many of you don't know the chairman had to rearrange his schedule, and as you know he's working really day and night, concerned about the potential Asian crisis and he's got a million things he's trying to do, but every time we call and ask he comes, and I think is always illuminating up here on the Hill. So I really very much appreciate his being here.
I want you to know, Mr. Chairman, that I have not had a chance to talk to all the Democrats, but the Republicans on this budget committee are in fact committed to maintaining the discipline of the budget agreement that was enacted last year.
I want to make it clear for myself it was more spending than I would have liked had I been king for a day. But nevertheless, this committee is going to be committed to maintaining the spending caps in this budget agreement, which really represents the discipline of this agreement. And I don't know whether you're aware of this or not, but over the life of that agreement there will only be in discretionary spending a half a percent increase over the life of this agreement, which is the lowest amount of growth in federal spending in that area I think in several decades.
Yesterday we were able to announce that at the end of this fiscal year the Congressional Budget Office estimates that there will be -- there will be an $8 billion surplus, and we know that 1969, when we walked on the moon, that was the last time we had a balanced budget. I don't even know when the last time it is that we ran a surplus, and surpluses are then projected out over the period of the next four or five years, and maybe longer. We looked all the way through 2002 -- adding up to about $150 billion worth of surpluses.
There is a very unfortunate report that is -- rumor that is circulating. I hope that it will not be confirmed -- that the president's budget will in fact not balance in the year 2000. Now, I am -- as you know, I frankly should have declared the president's budget dead on arrival. The only reason I didn't when it got up here is I was trying to be courteous, and I think that's always a good way to behave. But with $150 billion in new programs, and $130 billion worth of new taxes, most of which are projected or anticipated, if in fact we find out that the president's budget does not balance in the year 2000, then in my opinion he is breaking the budget, he is breaking our agreement, and worst of all he is breaking faith with the American people. It is just outrageous to me that after we got in t he room, Mr. Spratt and I and everybody else got in the room to find a couple of pennies for some programs, to turn around and to create $150 billion in new spending, and violate the budget caps and break the budget discipline, is precisely the wrong direction that we need to go. But let me suggest that I hope that over the course of these budget deliberations on our side we don't in some way manipulate the spending caps, either through the use of emergency bills or providing tax cuts financed out of debt. And I hope that we will have the courage to resist not just more highway spending but more spending on everything else. We want more highways -- fine, but let's pay for it by not spending money on something else, so we can maintain the discipline that I think has helped contribute to this good economic environment.
And we do in fact, Mr. Chairman, listen to you. We -- you came before this committee and said that if we could actually put a plan together to balance the budget interest rates could come down two points. That's precisely what happened. You made a promise, we delivered -- maybe not quite as well as you would have liked for us to have delivered in terms of some of these entitlement programs, but we made a good faith effort. And then you followed through with what you said. And that's why the government here ought to contribute to a strong economy. We ought not to blow it. There are too many other factors around the world that can get us in an economic fix, but this is one thing we have control over.
So while I may be concerned about what the president has done, and if this report is true, I hope the country will -- the whole country will clearly communicate to their members of Congress that they don't want a budget that doesn't balance in 2000. But we are also serving warning on our own side -- aren't we, Mr. Nussle? -- that we are going to stay within these caps, we are going to maintain the discipline, we are not going to scratch each other's backs, we are not going to finance tax cuts on the debt of our children, because we want this -- we want this program to continue to work.
Two other areas that I am concerned about -- how we use the surplus, Mr. Chairman, and I yesterday advanced the notion -- been talking about it for about -- well, a couple of months -- that any surplus -- part of the surplus -- ought to be used potentially to create individual retirement accounts for everybody who currently pays into Social Security. Those folks would have accounts opened. They would have some resources flow into those accounts. They would not be permitted to withdraw that money, but rather would have to keep it in those accounts for purposes of retirement, and would be permitted to invest that money the same way that federal workers do -- either in the stocks or stocks and bonds -- any combination, just like the federal workers do. And I'd be very interested as to how you feel about using part of the surplus on that.
And finally, Mr. Chairman, I am very concerned about where we are going with the International Monetary Fund. There is going to be a request for more money. I understand the need for the United States to be a very aggressive player in terms of the need for international financial stability. But what I am concerned about is we are getting the old tin lizzy, the old IMF, the old tin lizzy, without any hopes of what the next generation of automobiles is going to be in order to deal with these incredible transfers of resources across national lines. The flow of all these resources I think in a way renders the IMF outdated. And while there is a need for the United States to step up to the plate and be involved in international financial stability, I have not seen the new generation of institution that is designed to be able to deal with the complexities of the world financial situation, and the rapidity at which dollars -- or not dollars, but resources, currencies -- flow all over the world. So I look forward to your testimony this morning.
I didn't know that John Spratt has had an accident. He has got a little cast on his arm.
REP. JOHN SPRATT (D-SC): Watch out.
REP. KASICH: And I would like to recognize John for whatever comments he may have.
REP. SPRATT: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And Chairman Greenspan, welcome back to the House Budget Committee. We look forward to your testimony.
For the past five years the prudence that you brought to the nation's monetary policy has been matched by the nation's fiscal policy. The Fed has made some tough and unpopular decisions under your leadership, and stood by them. So has the Congress, particularly when we passed the deficit reduction act, or the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, the Clinton budget, in the face of weathering criticism. Our opponents on the other side of the aisle not only didn't give us a vote, they didn't give us any quarter. They said that budget would rip the economy, abort the recovery, mushroom the deficit. They couldn't have been more wrong, either in their analysis or in the vote they cast. Since the adoption of that budget the deficit has dropped every year for the last five years, and shows no sign of backing up. The economy has moved forward now for 84 months in a row, and shows no sign of slacking down.
Our efforts were crowned yesterday when the Congressional Budget Office confirmed that the budget will be in surplus for the first time in 29 years, and as far as CBO can see only surpluses appear on the horizon. That is extraordinarily good news.
There are many who think that the source of these results is the economy. And clearly the economy has played a role -- a big role. But on the other hand, having deficits decline for five years in a row, decline from $300 billion in 1992 to zero this year, to a surplus this year, surely boosted the economy too.
Furthermore, if we just dismiss the budget and quit with the economy as our explanation for the source of these budget results, we risk the -- run the risk of repeating the mistakes of history, of not learning the lessons of the last five to seven years, the hard fiscal lessons of discretionary spending limits, pay-go rules that have disciplined the budget and brought us to where we are. So we have real calls for celebration. I think my party does. I think we put the votes up that brought about these results, and we are savoring this moment. But we all, both sides of the aisle, need to be wary of euphoria. We shouldn't forget the budget disciplines that have brought us to this point, and we may very well find that surpluses are a bigger bone of contention, harder to deal with than deficits ever were. At least deficits dampened -- lowered expectations. Surpluses raise expectations, excite our ideas about either large tax cuts or new spending initiatives, all of which or some of which might undercut what we have accomplished.
I thought the president was right on in his State of the Union message when he said let's reserve every penny of this surplus until we have realized it, until we have got it in our pocket. Let's don't dissipate it, either spend it or give it away through tax cuts until we have actually realized it and until we have gone on at least to the first step towards the next stage of our fiscal problems, dealing with Social Security and Medicare -- let's not spend the surpluses.
And you, too, Mr. Chairman, have been very forthright in what you've said. I think you told the Senate, if I'm quoting you correcting, that putting the budget in significant surplus would be the surest and most direct way of increasing national savings and you've endorsed this idea of leaving the surplus intact, at least for the time being.
I hope you'll expound on that today. I hope you'll give us your reasons for why you think the best policy is what the president proposed, leave the surplus intact, deal next with Social Security before you do anything with it.
Mr. Kasich has raised the IMF. And I think it would be very, very useful for you to address the IMF also today, both to the audience here, the members of the committee and to the wider audience who may be listening. We have been blessed in the last 15 years by not having any external events like (OPIC I and OPIC II ?) to disrupt our economy. Your monetary policy would have been a lot harder to sustain if we had had exogenous impacts like that. We haven't had those.
But the Asian impact could reach us. We can't estimate it's magnitude yet. And we'd like for you to comment on why it's necessary to put another $18 billion capital subscription into the IMF, what the budget consequences are, and indeed, what the consequences would be if we didn't act.
You've always been forthright with us, and we look forward to your testimony again today.
Thank you for coming, Mr. Greenspan.
MR. GREENSPAN: Thank you very much.
REP. KASICH: The floor is yours, Mr. Chairman.
MR. GREENSPAN: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Just last week I presented the Federal Reserve's semiannual report on economic conditions and the conduct of monetary policy. This morning, I will briefly review some aspects of that outlook before I turn to a more detailed discussion of coming budgetary challenges.
The exemplary performance of the United States economy in 1997 will be hard to match. Last year's combination of robust expansion of activity, healthy creation of new jobs, and a decline in inflation generated widespread benefits for our citizens. Many of those benefits have the promise to be long-lived. Our nation has been experiencing a higher growth rate of productivity -- output per hour worked -- in recent years, which is the ultimate source of rising standards of living.
There can be no doubt that domestic demand retained some of its considerable momentum going into the new year. Production and employment have been on a strong uptrend in recent months. Confident households, enjoying gains in income and wealth and benefitting from the reductions in intermediate- and long-term interest rates to date, should continue to increase their spending. Firms should find financing available on relatively attractive terms to fund profitable opportunities to enhance efficiency by investing in new capital equipment. By itself, this strength in spending would seem to presage intensifying pressures in labor markets and on prices. Yet, the outlook for total spending on goods and services produced in the United States is less assured of late because of storm clouds massing over the Western Pacific and heading our way.
With the crisis curtailing the financing available in foreign currencies, and many Asian economies have had no choice but to cut back their imports sharply from the United States and elsewhere, a situation made worse by disruptions to their financial systems and economies more generally.
American exports should be held down further by the appreciation of the dollar, which will make the prices of competing goods produced abroad more attractive, just as foreign-produced goods will be relatively more attractive to buyers here at home. As a result, we can expect a worsening net export position to exert a discernible drag on total output in the United States and the dollar prices of our non- oil imports to extend their recent declines. These lower import prices are apparently already making domestic producers hesitant to raise their own prices for fear of losing market share, further contributing to the restraint on overall prices.
The key question going forward is whether the restraint building from the turmoil in Asia will be sufficient to check inflationary tendencies that might otherwise result from continued strength of domestic spending and tightening labor markets. The depth of the adjustment abroad will depend on the extent of weakness in the financial sectors of Asian economies and the speed with which structural inefficiencies in the financial and nonfinancial sectors of those economies are corrected.
If, as we suspect, the restraint going -- coming from Asia is sufficient to bring the demand for American labor back into line with the growth of the working-age population desirous of working, labor markets will remain unusually tight, but any intensification of inflation should be delayed, very gradual and readily reversible.
However, we cannot rule out two other more worrisome possibilities. On the one hand, should the momentum to domestic spending not be offset significantly by Asian or other developments, the American economy will be on a track along which spending could press too strongly against available resources to be consistent with contained inflation. On the other, we also need to be alert to the possibility that the forces from Asia might damp activity and prices by more than is desirable by exerting a particularly forceful drag on the volume of net exports and the prices of imports.
The robust economy has facilitated the efforts of the Congress and the administration to restore balance in a unified federal budget. The deficit dropped to its lowest level in more than two decades in fiscal 1997, and both the administration and the Congressional Budget Office now expect the budget to remain essentially in balance over the next few years before moving to moderate surpluses by the middle of the next decade.
I should caution, though, that while receipt growth remained robust through January, the prospects for fiscal 1998 as a whole remain uncertain until we have a tally of the final payments that will be included in the April -- in April's tax returns.
As I have indicated to the Congress on numerous occasions, putting the unified budget into significant surplus would be the surest and most direct way of increasing national saving. In turn, higher national saving, by promoting lower real long-term interest rates, helps spur spending to outfit American firms and their workers with the modern equipment they need to compete successfully on a worldwide basis.
We have seen a partial down payment of the benefits of better budget balance already. It seems reasonable to assume that the decline in long-term Treasury yields last year owed in part to reduced competition, current and prospective, from the federal government for scarce private saving.
But much hard work remains to be done to ensure that these projected surpluses actually materialize and that the appropriate budgetary strategy is in place to deal with the effects on federal entitlement spending of the looming shift in the nation's retirement demographics. The baseline projections from OMB and CBO provide a good starting point for assessing the budget outlook over the medium term. They are based on sensible economic and technical assumptions and thus offer a reasonable indication of how the budget is likely to evolve if economic conditions remain favorable and current budgetary policies remain in place.
However, the experience of the past few years amply demonstrates that such forecasts are subject to considerable error. For evidence on that score, we need only look back to the last winter. Even with fiscal 1997 already well under way, both CBO and OMB were overestimating last year's deficit by about $100 billion.
In retrospect, much of the error in last winter's deficit estimates fell on the inflow side, largely reflecting a surge in tax receipts that far exceeded estimates. This tax surprise, which helped lift the receipts share of GDP to an historical high, was not a new phenomenon. In the early 1990s, growth of receipts consistently fell short of expectations based on the trends in aggregate income and the tax laws then in place. Even after the fact, our knowledge about the source of such surprises has not always been definitive.
As a result, we must remain cautious about extrapolating recent favorable tax inflows into the future. We cannot rule out the possibility that the next few years will see a more rapid dissipation of the strength in receipts than either OMB and CBO have assumed, implying renewed deficits. Indeed, all else equal, had the 1997 surprise fallen on the other side -- downward instead of upward -- we would be confronted by non-trivial budget deficits at least through the beginning of the coming decade.
Moreover, the baseline projections assume that discretionary spending will be held to the statutory caps, which allow almost no growth in nominal outlays through fiscal 2002. Given the declining support for further reductions in defense spending, keeping overall discretionary spending within the caps is likely to require sizable, as yet unspecified, real declines in nondefense programs from current levels.
Not surprisingly, many observers are skeptical that the caps will hold, and battles over appropriations in coming years may well expose deep divisions that could make the realization of the budget projections less likely. In addition, although last year's legislation cut Medicare spending substantially, experience has highlighted the difficulty of controlling this program, raising the possibility that the savings will not be so great as anticipated, especially if resistance develops among beneficiaries or providers.
These uncertainties underscore the need for caution as you move ahead on your work on the 1999 budget. There is no guarantee that projected surpluses over the next few years will actually materialize. However, we can be more certain that, absent action, the budgetary position will erode after the next decade as the Baby Boom generation moves into retirement, putting massive strains on the social security and Medicare programs.
Without question, the task of stemming that erosion will become increasingly difficult the longer it is postponed. Indeed, especially in light of these inexorable demographic trends, I have always emphasized that we should be aiming for budgetary surpluses and using the proceeds to retire outstanding federal debt. In that regard, one measure of how much progress has been made in dealing with the nation's fiscal affairs is that serious discussion of such paydowns has begun to surface. Working down the stock of the federal debt would put further downward pressure on long-term rates, which would enhance private capital investment, labor productivity and economic growth, preparing us better to confront the looming changes in retirement demographics.
Over the decades, our budgetary processes have been biased toward deficit spending. Indeed, those processes are strewn with initiatives that were viewed as having only a small projected budgetary cost at inception but which produced a sizable drain on the Treasury's coffers over time.
As you are well aware, programs can be easy to initiate or expand, but extraordinarily difficult to trim or shut down once a constituency develops that has a stake in maintaining them. Thus far, the president and the Congress have been quite successful, contrary to expectations, in placing, and especially holding, caps on discretionary spending. More recently, they have started to confront the budget implications of the surge in retirements that will occur early in the next century. But the good news of late on the budget has unleashed an outpouring of proposals that, if adopted, do not bode well for the maintenance of fiscal discipline. Although many of the individual budget proposals may have merit, they must be considered only in the context of a responsible budget strategy for the long run.
In closing, I want to commend you, Chairman Kasich, and the members of the committee for your insistence on fiscal responsibility and persistent efforts to bring the budget under control. The shrinking budget deficit and the prospect of surplus stand as testimony to your and your committee members' your endeavors.
But we must remember that projections of surpluses are based on an extrapolation of steady economic growth and subdued inflation in coming years. Achieving such a performance in these uncertain times, with the American economy now subject to a fine balance of powerful forces of expansion and restraint, will provide policymakers with a considerable challenge.
And, on your part, not succumbing to the temptation to commit prematurely future surpluses that exist only on paper, while, in addition, addressing the adverse effects of ongoing demographic changes to the budget over the longer run, will not be easy. However, if we meet these challenges, the increase in national savings and investment will almost surely pay off handsomely in the form of a more rapidly expanding standard of living for all Americans.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
REP. KASICH: Well, I want to thank you.
And I think that last sentence -- ' . . . will surely pay off handsomely in the form of a more rapidly expanding standard of living for all Americans' -- and, you know,, I think sometimes up here we forget who we're talking about and I'm looking over here at Bob Ehrlich, whose father was a car salesman. And, you know, if we up here in Congress can actually do something to make your dad's life a little better, Bob, we've got to go to war for what, don't we? I mean, no matter who we've got to fight. And it's not about expanded living, it's about food on the table and clothes for kids, and you know, that's what it's really all about.
And, Mr. Chairman, we're committed to it.
I wanted to ask you, we're going to have emergency appropriation bills coming up here. We have a few years ago made a point in saying we would have no emergency bills that would be passed unless we had some legitimate offsets, substituted some other spending cuts for those spending increases.
I look at emergencies as a way to get around the spending caps and for people in Washington to basically declare that this spending doesn't count and we shouldn't even pay any attention to it.
What is your sense about what signals we send if we pass an emergency bill that does not have proper offsets and expands the size of government?
MR. GREENSPAN: Mr. Chairman, I think that a very reluctant financial market is increasingly concluding that the budget balance and prospective surpluses are becoming increasingly real, in large part because they have, after very considerable skepticism, come to believe that those caps are real. And they have -- they've embodied themselves, or the expectation of the continuation of those caps has embodied itself, in a lower real long-term interest rate, which has very important implications on economic activity.
I would be very careful with that terribly important phenomenon. It is tenuous, it is easy to dissipate. And to use the analogy of a bursting dam, you know, you pull a couple of bricks out and nothing happens; pull a few more bricks out and you get a little flow of water; and then the next brick, the whole thing breaks apart.
And I should be very careful on this issue because there's nothing more important in the credibility of the budget process, as I envisage it, reflecting itself in market prices, than those discretionary caps. Those were the most -- those were the least expected elements to create budget discipline, and they have turned out to be a very powerful force. Let's not lose them.
REP. KASICH: I want you to know that all the members of the committee, we are gathered at the base of the dam and we've got our fingers in all these different holes, and we take turns, we don't all -- none of us all sleep at the same time, we're in shifts.
Let me ask you about financing tax cuts out of debt. There's going to be a push for tax cuts. What if we were to do tax cuts and to finance it without cutting government? What would your sense be of the response in terms of that?

MR. GREENSPAN: I think we learn from the same type of problem, that is, there is a degree of credibility in the marketplace which is exceptionally important. And while I'm scarcely opposed to tax cuts, I would very much like to see them. Indeed, as you know, I'm an advocate of actually eliminating the capital gains tax completely.
It has to be done in the context of bringing the expenditure side down commensurately, because to bring receipts down and borrow the money is scarcely an advantage to the system. And those who say that deficits don't matter, I would really say to them, that was an argument which one could conceivably make from a statistical point of view 10 or 15 years ago. With the data that has mounted over the last decade, it's becoming very clear that deficits do matter, they affect interest rates, and interest rates have a very profound effect, especially long-term interest rates, on economic activity.
So I think that an extraordinarily important amount of confidence in the budget process has been gained in recent years and it's had a significant impact on the financial structure. It's contributed massively to the extent of the prosperity with which we are currently involved. Let's be very careful with the process that's created it. It is too easy to break it down.
REP. KASICH: I made the suggestion, Mr. Chairman, that if we find ourselves in a surplus mode, that one of the things that we can do, because as you say we cannot predict very accurately the future in terms of these surpluses; what I have tried to put on the table for consideration is the creation of an individual retirement account for everyone who currently pays into Social Security.
Let's assume that we have $200 billion worth of budget surpluses, maybe we use 50 billion to retire some public debt, and then we would use 150 billion to recreate account for everybody who pays into Social Security. You would not be able to withdraw from that account to buy a new stereo; you'd have to leave it in there for purposes of retirement. And the investments that you could make would be restricted to the kind of investments that federal employees and members of Congress make. That way, the better the news is on the surplus, the more that would flow into those accounts.
If you were banking on tax cuts based on future surpluses, you could find yourself running short. You may even have to find yourself either having to cut other spending or remove those tax breaks.
What is your notion of the idea of creating an individual retirement account as I describe it, in terms of a first step toward being able to address the real structural reforms we need in Social Security? Does the idea have merit, in your judgment?
MR. GREENSPAN: I think it does, Mr. Chairman. I think that there are numerous versions of the so-called solution to the 2 percentage point Social Security gap, that is, 2 percent of taxable income capped over the long run between benefits and payments, which has got to be closed. And the more I've thought about it, the more I'm struck by the fact that some form of gradual privatization of the type which you are suggesting seems to be the most sensible.
I would be careful in the context of moving it to be certain, however, that the surpluses are there first, or -- no, I really shouldn't say that. I'd say that it's important that the surpluses be there, but even if the surpluses are not there, something of the type of reform of Social Security in the nature in which you postulate it is probably desirable.
So while I don't deny that using the surplus is an easy way to get into it, I'd be a little careful about tying the Social Security reform irrevocably to that surplus. You're going to have do Social Security reform in any way, and I think that the type of program which you're putting on the table probably would stand scrutiny even if we didn't have surpluses.
REP. KASICH: Well, the -- and the thing is, Mr. Chairman, you would only have that account filled if there were a surplus.
MR. GREENSPAN: Well, ultimately you're going to have to come to grips with the Social Security problem one way or the other.
REP. KASICH: The only thing I'm suggesting is, is the more people get interested in the idea of actually having a passbook account where they can see accumulated dollars, it begins to make them more comfortable with the concept that they actually own something, like they've seen in Chile, which I hope would contribute to higher national savings, because as people tend to see the gains they make from savings, there's really a natural feeling that I'd like to save more.
MR. GREENSPAN: Yeah, as a matter of fact, a Chilean friend of mine said, when the so-called recognition bonds came out, which essentially designated in a little passbook what their Social Security net worth was, everyone carried them around and waved them, as though, you know, I've got wealth, I've got a commitment to the economy, to the society.
And I don't think we should shortchange that. It may seem a bit beside the point from an economist's point of view, but sometimes we economists have got to see a somewhat larger picture.
REP. KASICH: Boy, you say that again anyway. (Laughing.)
MR. GREENSPAN: I would have -- (inaudible) --
The last thing I want to explore briefly, Mr. Chairman, because other members have questions, is in the area of the IMF.
My -- look, my feeling is there is a need for some kind of mechanism. But when George Schulz -- I'm sure you're -- I don't know if you -- George Schulz pretty smart guy; I mean, he's even working on creating a -- turning a par 3 into a par 4, the George Schulz Rule -- you know what a smart guy he is.
And he, along with Bill Simon and Walter Wriston, have come out and said we should not have the IMF. It's making the case even that in some instances it's a mechanism that can hurt, that can give a false sense of security, that can shield economic activities from the power of the market.
I know there's going to be a request up here to put more money into the IMF, but I don't find anything that accompanies that request that calls for the fundamental reform we need in terms of dealing with the real problem of liquidity.
Now, here you have a circumstance where the Mexican bailout is 30 billion and the Asian bailout now looks to be, I don't know, in the vicinity of 120, and if the next one ends up being about 450, I don't think there's enough liquidity in the world to keep bailing people out.
And I just would wonder, I'd like to -- in fact I will send to you some ideas I have in terms of level playing fields for business to be able to enter markets, for the ability to really use bankruptcy laws in foreign countries, the need to not permit banks to really serve as a way station to flow currency from our country to another country through a bank that really doesn't have the assets or the control, and not substituting sovereignty, a country's sovereignty, for any kind of guarantee that these monies are going to be repaid.
I'd like to send you this and have you look at it. But I really do not believe the IMF increase will be approved here unless accompanied in writing, in concrete, with a significant set of fundamental reforms in the way that the international marketplace ought to work. And I wondered your sense about not just the request for more authority to the IMF but the accompanying proposals to begin to give us the kind of transparencies that we need into the activities of countries around the world.
Can you guarantee us in some way that your staff will begin to work on assembling and recommending to the Congress a series of reforms that will put real teeth into whatever mechanism we finally approve? You know, there's one thing to promise. Reagan used to say, 'Trust, but verify.' I think the secretary is asking us to trust. And that's okay. I like him. I trust him. But I also want to push him that he can verify that the real reforms will occur. Mr. Chairman.
MR. GREENSPAN: Mr. Chairman, let me tell you what is happening in the context of your remarks. Something new has been going on in the international financial system as the plethora of new financial products have accelerated. And what we have observed is a really quite different high-tech international financial system which, while having many of the characteristics of the previous system, is really in many respects unique.
This means we have basically two observations of types of crises with which to deal to learn how the system functions. First was the Mexican crisis. Second was the Asian crisis. And we're now finally beginning to learn the mechanisms, the instabilities, where the disequilibria come from, and as a consequence, what type of new regime, new regulatory regime, would be required to address that particular type of structure.
We're not there yet. We're spending a very considerable time -- that is, those of us at the Federal Reserve, at the Treasury, and in continuous meetings -- to try to craft a view of the longer-term type of structure that we believe will be required. The elements you just defined are very critical players within that particular type of view of the way the system should function.
In that context, there is invariably going to be the need for a specific type of international facility which has liquidity capabilities but contingencies associated with it. It cannot be a huge one because, as you point out quite correctly, this international financial system is accelerating at a very rapid pace and each new crisis requires ever more bailout funds, if I may use the term.
So we don't see it as status quo. We do see the fact that the Old Tin Lizzie will not work in this new environment. But until we have in place a structure which we feel comfortable with, not just reviving the IMF but thinking of the total structure that must be addressed, you can't just do it piecemeal. And until we've got that in place, we still need that Old Tin Lizzie to take us to go fishing, because walking won't get us there sufficiently quickly.
So what this request is is not new spending authorities. What it is is essentially increasing a letter of credit which, in all likelihood, will not be employed because it will not be needed if this international financial crisis simmers down. But if it has a second leg to it and it requires an international vehicle to essentially come to grips with the problem, there will not be enough time for the Congress to convene and authorize this letter of credit.
It's not the use of taxpayer funds in the sense that it appears on the outlay side, because to the extent that there is a draw of dollars on that letter of credit, the Treasury gets a comparable asset which CBO and others have scored under the unified budget, as you know, as an offset to the amounts of money, so that this is not an outlay issue. It is a commitment of sovereign guarantee, and that is important. But it doesn't displace other programs and only puts very marginal pressure on the financial markets.
And in summary, I would say to you that while I certainly agree with the general thrust of your remarks, and indeed, hopefully that's the way we are going -- and I might say parenthetically that not only have all of us learned how this new international financial system is working, but so is the IMF. They are no longer supportive of what I think in the past are the types of things which have led to the criticism of George Shultz and Bill Simon and Walt Liston (sp). I think they are in the process of changing.
Nonetheless, I do grant you that significant changes in a lot of things are going to be required if we are going to successfully address this problem, crisis number three in the future.
REP. KASICH: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Spratt is recognized.
REP. SPRATT: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Chairman Greenspan, for your excellent testimony. I was interested to hear you credit the discretionary spending caps as one of the real sources of the budget results we're now seeing. The general public doesn't understand that. The media generally doesn't appreciate that. Most people don't even know what discretionary spending is, much less that we have statutory caps in place for five years.
Just to complement what I said at the outset, for the record I might recall that the statutory caps that we have lived under in the budget for the last five years were imposed in the Deficit Reduction Act of 1993, and that is one of the sources of its success and one of the reasons we can credibly, I think, say that it has brought us to the point that we find ourselves at right now.
One of the issues that we'll have to face this year is whether or not we continue to keep those rules in place. There were two rules, the discretionary spending cap and the pay-go rules that we both adopted in 1990, reaffirmed in 1993 and extended in 1997 in the balanced budget agreement last year.
One proposal which the chairman has sometimes associated himself with is that we could have a modification of the so-called pay-go rule, the pay-as-you-go rule, which would allow tax cuts to be paid for out of the surplus, that we could use some of the surplus for tax cuts in the sense that we were giving back to the American people some of the surplus money that they have sent us in the form of tax increases. Would you recommend or endorse or support any change in those budget disciplines right now?
MR. GREENSPAN: I wouldn't be -- on the pay-go issue, which I grant you is another very crucial issue, provided it is not for expenditures, I don't think the markets would react particularly negatively on the tax side unless the numbers were large. But even there, I think you have to be a little cautious about how to handle that. It's not -- the crucial issue in the market is, as best I can judge, on the expenditure side. Any -- that's where the fear of the burgeoning deficits are and the potential impact on borrowing requirements and hence on the financial structure.
Nonetheless, you can't just willy-nilly abandon pay-go for any type of tax cut. But obviously if there are surpluses, then at some point there's going to be a level of surpluses which I think is quite appropriate to get back to the taxpayer.
REP. SPRATT: I hear you --
MR. GREENSPAN: I think it's important to be careful in the process.
REP. SPRATT: But if I understand the whole of your testimony, it is to the effect that the surpluses have yet to be realized; that these are reasonable projections, but projections can change; and that until we've actually materially realized the surpluses, we shouldn't dispose of them either by spending increases or tax reductions. Is that correct?
MR. GREENSPAN: Absolutely. Let me just say something which we don't recognize too often and perhaps ought to, and it shows up in the CBO projections that they released yesterday. It's the impact of what I would call the virtuous circle of surpluses.
When you get a surplus, the debt goes down, obviously, by definition. Interest payments fall. And the next year you're operating with the base of a higher surplus. And if you take a look at CBO's data, as you know, their surpluses begin to accelerate. (Net?), it's all the result of interest payments. In other words, the primary deficit as a percent of GDP doesn't change.
What is happening is that the surplus, by reducing the level of the three-and-three-quarter-trillion current debt to the public, reduces interest payments. And those interest payments reduce the subsequent -- increase the subsequent surplus. And it works in a sense that it becomes cumulative. It is very easy to reverse that process, as we have experienced at too many times on the deficit side.
REP. SPRATT: Well, specifically, if we don't allow the surpluses to accrue and rack up, then you don't enjoy that process.
MR. GREENSPAN: That's exactly the reason why I think it's important to let's get them in place first. Let them start to work on their virtuous cycle. Have them impact on interest rates. And only after you're getting those real benefits that you should -- it's only then that I think it's desirable to start looking at possible alternate uses. But until they are there, just remember that economic forecasting, budget forecasting, is particularly precarious, especially when you have very large receipts and expenditures and the deficit is only the difference between the two.
REP. SPRATT: You were chairman of the commission that restructured Social Security and extended its solvency well into the next century. And one of the decisions of that commission was to accelerate payroll taxes and to accumulate in the Social Security retirement trust fund surpluses that would partially prefund the liabilities of the program into the next century.
Could you explain to us how allowing the surpluses to build up and increase over time supports and undergirds Social Security?
MR. GREENSPAN: Well, I think that the best way of looking at the Social Security system over the longer run is to think of that first in physical terms, and then secondarily, only in the way we finance it.

In physical terms, what we are trying to do is have individuals, while they are working, put some of their income aside, or, if you want to be more graphic, take part of their groceries that they buy at the supermarket and stick them in the basement and sort of build up a physical resource that one can dig into after retirement; or, a little bit more relevant, to put monies in equipment and investment through your savings that increases the productivity growth levels, raises the aggregate standards of living so that the amount of goods produced over the longer run will be supporting both the standards of living of workers at that time and the standards of living of the significant increase in retirees that we're currently beginning to see.
One way or another, you need full funding of that, meaning you have to get the groceries in the basement enough that you're going to need. Whether that is done through surpluses in the unified budget account or in the private sector doesn't matter in that context. I mean, I happen to favor doing it in the private system because I think it is far easier and far more difficult to reverse if you've got full funding created in the private sector.
If, however, you did get full funding created in the public sector, in Social Security, and ran the Social Security surplus outside of the unified budget, so that the unified surplus would be the size of the Social Security surplus, you'd get the same effect. And indeed, allowing the surplus to rise and going sort of nominally into the Social Security trust fund has that sort of an effect. And that's the reason why, when the president came out with the general suggestion, I thought it was a good idea, I thought it was a good idea, as a way of looking at the process of building unified budget surpluses.
REP. SPRATT: Thank you very much.
With respect to the surplus, you've indicated, obviously, that these forecasts we've learned from the past are highly variable, even in the short term. CBO in its projection has allowed a five-tenths, a half of a percentage point, adjustment for the likely effects of the Asian problems upon our economy. Do you think that's a reasonable adjustment? Is there a possibility it could be greater than that?
MR. GREENSPAN: It's too early to say. In other words, at the moment estimates ranging from a half to 1 percent are what generally most people are judging. But we really have not had a phenomenon like this before to be able to go back, open up the textbook and see what happened the previous time such an episode occurred; the page is missing.
And we're making sort of ad hoc judgments, and as a consequence of that we find ourselves to be finding every type of way in which we can sense what's happening prior to when the real data actually show up months after the fact.
I have nothing at this particular stage which suggests to me that the CBO estimate is particularly out of line. REP. SPRATT: You made a persuasive case for the re-subscription to the IMF that's being called for. But toward the end, you kind of undercut your case by acknowledging that the money might not actually be needed, if the problems in Asia, as you put it, simmer down.
What if we weren't to put the money up? What would be the likely consequences?
MR. GREENSPAN: Well, congressman, I would first say that the probability that those moneys will be needed are not very large. But if they are required, meaning that if we are wrong about the sort of full consequences of the Asian crisis working itself out, and it is indeed far more virulent than we now anticipate, if we don't have resources available to confront it at that time, the consequences could be very severe.
So, in summary, what I am saying is although the probability of an adverse event is relatively small, if it happens the consequences are so large that we want to make certain to ensure ourselves. And it's, to me, a fairly clear-cut economic policy decision. This is not the type of risk you want to allow to go uninsured, if I may put it that way.
REP. SPRATT: Now, what about the risk of the investment? As you have described it, it sounds as though it were something like a certificate of deposit. We put the money there, it draws interest, we have special drawing rights up to the amount that we contributed. Do you think this is a safe, sound, secure investment for American tax dollars?
MR. GREENSPAN: Well, we have been involved with the IMF for 50 years and it's never cost us a cent. And it is structured in a manner in which the assets are such that -- or I should say, the cover is such, the liquidity is such in the system, that it's very hard to envisage the type of crisis in which, one, funds would be drawn from our letter of credit, and two, not fully returned. I mean, it is theoretically possible -- I'm not saying to you they are not at risk. But it is pretty low risk. And in the sense that what we're talking is about is $18 billion as a line of credit and -- the chances of any of that being lost are very small. And if any of it were lost, it would be a very small fraction of the 18 billion.
REP. SPRATT: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
REP. KASICH: Mr. Hobson is recognized.
REP. DAVID HOBSON (R-OH): Thank you. Thank you for being here today, Mr. Chairman.
I want to thank you for your statements that you made, because they're very helpful to all of us in trying to maintain the integrity of this budgetary process that we've embarked on here.
I also want to give you an opportunity to go back and discuss something which you've discussed here today once again. And if you were king for a day -- some people think you are king -- tell us what you would do in the next five years relating to this purported surplus that we're going to have, and with the idea that things are be kind of okay and maybe -- (inaudible) -- little incorrect in the size of it now, it might go up, you know. What would you do? You kind of led us into that. I'd like to give you an opportunity again.
MR. GREENSPAN: Let me tell you what I would not do.
REP. HOBSON: Okay.
MR. GREENSPAN: I would not use it on the expenditure side, because it's potentially very dangerous. It's very beguiling to say we have this pot of money, we can spend some of it. The pressures to spend have been muted really remarkably in the last decade or so, and I think it's been one of the major advances in governance in this country, that we have been able to bring the deficit down from close to 300 billion down to zero. It's been a remarkable performance, irrespective of how it happened.
What we have to be very careful about is returning to the old ways which got us into the soup in the first place.
I have mixed impressions as to exactly how to address the remainder of the surplus. My first impression is the world would not come to an end if we just generated increasingly larger surpluses for a while. What that would do would be to pay down a goodly part of the debt we expanded in recent decades. It would move real long-term interest rates lower. It would create continued momentum in economic activity. And there are less -- it's hard to envisage a significantly more favorable scenario than that.
I recognize that there are very considerable political pressures to do otherwise. And I'm not naive enough -- REP. HOBSON: Everybody wants a -- (inaudible) -- in their pot, you know?
MR. GREENSPAN: However, you made me king for a day. Before I send my resignation in, which is on its way to you -- I would be careful about dissipating it. You can always do it later. In other words, there's no urgency here. I mean, if we allow the thing to build up and the virtuous cycle of increasing surpluses to arise, that's not the worst scenario in the world.
We used to have a notion in this country about fiscal drag, about the extent to which as the budget went into surplus it would throw the economy into unemployment. It is really quite remarkable that that term is in disuse. Now, I will acknowledge that if the economy gets weak again, it will reemerge. But it is not a significant issue, provided we can make the case that interest rates will fall under the pressure of surpluses and the economy will maintain significant effective demand as a consequence of that.
REP. HOBSON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think that's a very significant statement. And it's very helpful to us.
Just two other quick questions. Do you feel the same about the death tax as you do about capital gains, or do you have a difference of opinion --
MR. GREENSPAN: I'm sorry -- about what?
REP. HOBSON: Well, we call it the death tax. The estate tax.
MR. GREENSPAN: (Laughs.)
REP. HOBSON: Because you were talking about --
MR. GREENSPAN: Yeah -- no --
REP. KASICH: The richer he gets, the less he likes it; I can tell you that.
REP. KASICH (?): Or the older he gets.
REP. HOBSON: The older you get. (Laughs.)
MR. GREENSPAN: I don't feel as strongly about that as I do capital gains tax. I do have concerns about it, I do have concerns that a lot of people have with respect to small business and farms. And I think that those issues are legitimate.
I also recognize that we do have to have revenue in the system, and if one can find a way to cut the expenditure side sufficiently there's all sorts of things you can do on the receipts side.

But I would say that it's a second-order priority to capital tax gains and marginal income tax rates. I would put the estate tax beyond that.
REP. HOBSON: Okay. My time's going to run out and you may not have to find the answer to this. But I want to shift gears a little bit.
As the chairman of the agency with primary oversight of the banking system, I'm curious what the potential impact of the year 2000 computer software problem is on the banking industry, and really, what's being done to alleviate this problem?
MR. GREENSPAN: Well, the first thing, Congressman, is we don't know what the size of the problem is. We do know that a lot of computer programmers 20-30 years ago, trying to save capacity, put into place, as you know, two digits instead of four digits with respect to how to put the number of years down.
I was one of those culprits. I mean, I have contributed to this problem. I'm guilty. And I will tell you, we don't have the slightest degree of documentation of what it is we did back then, largely because it never entered our minds that those programs would still be functioning today. It's not that we didn't know that there was a potential problem, it's just it seemed utterly remote.
We are trying to encourage all of the institutions which are under our regulatory aegis to recognize how crucial a potential problem is to their financial well being. And what we've observed is a major thrust on the part of the larger banks and holding companies, who to a substantial extent are -- have made great progress in rooting out some of these obsolete programs which can cause problems. Medium- size banks and especially those banks which have outside providers are still not quite there yet. Nonetheless, on average, we probably have well over 90 percent compliance at this point.
The trouble is, is that 90 percent or 95 percent may sound very impressive, but all you need is a few little major glitches in the system and the ramifications can be really awesome. And so we are -- we have a two-track system. One is, prevent it from happening, but then think of what we would do if it did.
REP. HOBSON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
REP. KASICH: Mr. Mollohan is recognized.
REP. ALAN MOLLOHAN (D-WV): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Greenspan, welcome to the hearing today.
You spoke during your testimony about the impact the Asian crisis would have on imports and exports, negative net impact to the United States. Recently you were quoted as saying there is a small but not negligible probability that the crisis will have an unexpectedly large negative effect on a number of areas, including the United States.
First, just a little interpretation. What do you mean to say by, 'there is a small but not negligible probability of a negative impact'?
MR. GREENSPAN: Yeah, the -- the number on that, is that what you mean -- ?
REP. MOLLOHAN: No, I mean, what does 'small but not negligible --
MR. GREENSPAN: Well, small --
REP. MOLLOHAN: -- probability' -- if it's a probability I think --
MR. GREENSPAN: Small but not negligible is an economist's fudge to -- for a number which is well under 50 percent, very significantly under 50 percent, but also measurably above zero. I'm merely expressing my degree of uncertainty rather than anything terribly sophisticated.
REP. MOLLOHAN: Well, could you speak to this issue of probability, the impact, and maybe talk a little bit about the scale?
MR. GREENSPAN: As I said previously, congressman, we have not really seen an event of this nature in recent times, to be able to get a model which, based on history, will tell us a great deal as to how it may actually impact. We are observing -- obviously, with the very significant decline in imports in East Asia, we're beginning to see some declines in some of our exports to this country and not yet large enough to really have a major impact.
But I do think, as best we can judge from the models that we have which relate exchange rates and movements of traded goods, that the net impact on our exports and imports will have a dampening effect on overall domestic production; in the terms in which I've put it, modest but clearly still discernible.
REP. MOLLOHAN: I'm concerned about the impact it might have on various sectors. Have you looked at that?
MR. GREENSPAN: You mean, individual industries?
REP. MOLLOHAN: Whether this impact will be disproportionate on different sectors; say, an industry sector or the steel sector.
MR. GREENSPAN: Sure.
REP. MOLLOHAN: Right now imports are inching up into the high 20s, which is the point that it really starts affecting viability of the domestic steel industry.
MR. GREENSPAN: Yeah. I think that we are -- it's clear that production of steel in Southeast Asia is holding up and that the markets -- as somebody said the other day, there are many loaded ships with (flat-rolled?) products in the Pacific on their way here. They're waiting. The chances of getting increased imports of steel, I think, are fairly high. You're dealing with a degree of technological sophistication in that area which is not bad.
They can produce some products which are competitive with ours, and therefore they're able to import them. And obviously in some of the lower-grade products they do very well on price. So there is -- there are pressures. As I'm sure you're aware, there are also significant domestic capacity increases coming on board as well, so that even though demand is really quite strong in this country, that pricing has been rather weak.
REP. MOLLOHAN: Yeah. My question is, what impact will this Asian crisis have on imports, and particularly --
MR. GREENSPAN: On imports?
REP. MOLLOHAN: -- of steel? What is the margin that we're talking about? And then I want to ask you, how would you suggest addressing that problem? You've got a short-term problem if they're on the boats being sent over here, and perhaps with regard to this crisis, more long-term.
MR. GREENSPAN: Well, I don't have a specific tonnage estimate of what's implied here. I do know that if we try to impose various different forms of restraint, that I think we could undercut our own domestic steel capabilities. I think the evolution of the mini-mills and the new technologies that have evolved as a consequence of real import pressures in the past have really created an industry in this country which is a new one.
It's not the one of blast furnaces and big old-fashioned open hearths which dominated the world in the 1950s. We got pretty much far behind the curve, and we try to solve that through various different types of restraints. And it's only when we stopped doing that that I think American technology and ingenuity really came forward and I think has created something we ought to be proud of.
REP. MOLLOHAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
REP. KASICH: Mr. Herger is recognized for five minutes.
REP. WALLY HERGER (R-CA): Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
And Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your appearing before us. I appreciate the continued advocacy on your part to fiscal responsibility and your being before our committee today. I'd appreciate your comments, if we could, on a comparison of policy. We've heard earlier today, we continue to hear some referring back to the 1993 president's -- during the Democrat-controlled Congress in which we had the $270 billion tax increase at that time, which, by the way, every Republican in both the House and the Senate opposed.
But yet we hear this seemingly claimed by many of those who supported that largest tax increase in history that their feeling is the reason for the economy doing so well today and the reason for our surpluses today are because of that tax increase as compared with the policies we have seen in the last three years that are markedly different, if not 180 degrees different, of rather than tax increases, actually $95 billion tax reduction, a determination in this Congress to hold to the caps, as you referred to earlier, of being so important. I guess my question is, in your opinion, which is the better way for our economy, that of balancing our budget by increasing taxes so as to meet our expenditures or by those of perhaps maintaining our spending where it is, or perhaps even reducing the amount of increase, coupled with tax reductions in order to control spending? Which, in your opinion, is the best policy for our economy?
MR. GREENSPAN: Well, Congressman, I've stated many times in the past that endeavoring to close a budget deficit by increasing taxes is a futile activity; the reason being, as you raise taxes, you begin to cut into the productive capability of the system, and over the long run revenues fall, not rise. And as a consequence of that, arithmetically you cannot achieve a fully viable system in which expenditures are rising as a percent of the GDP and taxes are rising by comparable amounts. What will happen is that the GDP will slow down, expenditures will not, revenues will, and the deficit will expand.
Over the long run, the only way to address a chronic budget deficit is from the expenditure side. The others will not work. The answer to your question, therefore, is that very clearly I think that the only long-term sound way to address a fiscal policy which is eroding is to come to grips with expenditures. Raising taxes is only a short-term fix and very likely to end up being counterproductive.
REP. HERGER: Well, I thank you for your comment. And, of course, we are seeing, at least as has been expressed in the president's budget, a continuing of this policy or his policy and that of the former Democratic Congress, of increasing taxes in the president's proposed budget. And I would take it from your comments then that you would have concerns for us to continue as we did in '93 down that path?
MR. GREENSPAN: Well, I don't want to comment specifically on the president's budget detail, but as a general rule the proposition of cutting spending being preferable to raising taxes to resolve a budget deficit I think is a principle which has held up rather well over time.
REP. HERGER: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
REP. KASICH: Mr. Pomeroy is recognized.
REP. EARL POMEROY (D-ND): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman, you have stated to this committee in the past that the '93 budget bill has made a positive contribution in bringing the nation's fiscal house in order. Does that continue to be your position?
MR. GREENSPAN: Yes, I mean, I think that bringing the deficit down was very important. I would have preferred that they were brought down in that bill wholly on the expenditure side, as I just indicated to your colleague. But there's no question that the impact of bringing the deficit down set in place a series of events -- a virtuous cycle, if I may put it that way -- which has led us to where we are.
REP. POMEROY: We have future issues to debate, and so further discussion of past issues perhaps isn't warranted, although there are several things I'd like to pursue.
I want to commend Chairman Kasich, I want to commend my colleague Smith, for their creative thinking on Social Security. The --
REP. KASICH: Elaborate. Elaborate. (Laughter.)
REP. POMEROY: Yeah. Well, I -- actually, I have a question. The thing that strikes me about the Greenspan Commission work in '83 relative to the reforms moved forward about Social Security is that they were comprehensive. It was a comprehensive evaluation. The entire product was moved forward, not a part of the product here and a part of the product there as the commission continued its work. It finished its work and moved the package forward.
It strikes me that for this Congress to allocate surplus in some direction other than paying down the national debt, as you suggest in your testimony, is basically making a down payment on a Social Security change prior to the time we've figured it out. In other words, the surpluses through the year 2008 are all derived from the surpluses within the Social Security program, not the only portion of the budget.
And so, to the extent that we allocate surpluses anywhere, we are spending Social Security surplus. So for the chairman to move his idea forward, we'd be taking Social Security surplus and putting it in non-Social Security individual retirement accounts. Now, that may or may not have merit, but I just think we need to be aware. We're essentially making a down payment with Social Security surplus on a system other than Social Security.
Now, it would seem to me that if we look at these accounts and how they might (incent?) individual retirement savings -- and, by the way, I have spent a great deal of time in trying to figure out ways to (incent?) individual retirement savings and bring the nation's savings rate up -- it's going to be terribly important that we have a significant amount in those accounts, something more than nominal.
I get a kick out of thinking back to the days when the chairman and I were in college and George McGovern was running for president. He was going to give everybody $1,000, and it was a widely derided idea. The idea of giving everybody retirement accounts reminds me a little of that idea.
REP. KASICH: Earl, you started so strong. (Laughter.)
REP. POMEROY: Well, but if you look at -- let's look at the account idea in terms of can you get enough in there. Can you get enough in there to offset the benefit reduction that you're going to have to make in Social Security because you're taking the surplus for Social Security and you're allocating it elsewhere?
Now, this is where the chairman's idea, as intriguing as it is, begins to fall apart, I fear. If you take all of the budget surplus CBO projected yesterday for '98 and established individual accounts for the number of Americans with Social Security numbers -- I don't know what that number is; there's 268 million Americans; 34 million of them are in retirement. You've got 234 million. But just for the sake of argument, let's say you had about 200 million Americans you're going to try and establish accounts for.

You take $8 billion to establish accounts for 200 million Americans, you've got $40 in each account. Ninety-nine surplus, you'd add $45. Year 2000 surplus by CBO, you'd add another $5; $65 in '01, $335 in '02, $265 in '03. By the end, not counting interest and all this investment return you're going to generate, but you take the next six years of directing all of the Social Security surplus into individual accounts, you've got $755 in the account. Now, you'll have investment interest on that. Let's say you got it up to $1,000 over the next six years.
So I have serious questions in terms of whether this would be the route we'd want to go without necessarily evaluating in total the changes we would want to bring on-line in Social Security. I think we're at the point in the Social Security debate where there aren't any dumb ideas. Let's throw them all on the table and wade through them over the next year. But I don't think we ought to go down one route versus another route until we have had that national discussion and the consensus process building, leading to legislation.
Now, you indicate, Mr. Chairman -- I guess I'm at the end of my question here -- you indicate in your testimony that paying down the national debt does have a positive effect on preparing the country for the Social Security hit that baby boomers will present. For '98, for the strategy for '98, would you reckon that might be the best way to go?
MR. GREENSPAN: You mean, just allow the surpluses to accumulate?
REP. POMEROY: Yes.
MR. GREENSPAN: No, I would say, if I had my choice right at this stage, as I responded to your colleague across the aisle, I would let the surpluses run. Let's find out how deep-seated they are. They may be more than we realize. I mean, productivity is showing signs of accelerating. If it's real, if the trend has actually significantly changed and stays that way, receipts will be higher and the surplus could very well be larger than we're projecting just as easily as it can be a lot lower or non-existent.
So we don't yet know what this is. As I mentioned before, you know, we're talking about a total budget of a trillion-six and receipts, obviously, the same size. And a couple of percentage points off in those estimates have a big effect on the difference. And we don't know at this point what we're looking at. We're looking at a lot of forecasts.
And as I've said previously, the world will scarcely come to an end if we generate some fairly substantial deficits for a period of time. And at that point, we can decide what we do. I mean, that's the type of governmental decision which is really, you know, quite favorable. At least you don't have to worry about how you're going to close the deficit, you know; which constituency is going to get skewered in one form or another. I mean, these are very nice choices to have to confront. But let's let it arise first so we know what it is we're -- the base from which we're choosing from.
REP. POMEROY: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
REP. KASICH: Mr. Miller is recognized.
REP. DAN MILLER (R-FL): Mr. Chairman, it's good to see you again today. Let me thank you for your strong support for us to have fiscal discipline, and specifically the issue of spending caps. You've spoken very strongly on that issue for the past year, and we're now at a very serious debate within Congress about what to do about the spending caps problem. And I'm interested in what the effect is if we break that cap.
Many of us on both sides of the aisle -- Congressman Minge and I will be doing a panel discussion this afternoon about the problems of breaking the cap. The president's budget has $5 billion over in discretionary spending for such good things in spending as NIH or school construction, and a lot of Republicans and Democrats want to spend more money on roads and bridges.
But even if it's $5 billion more, I mean, $5 billion out of a $1.6 trillion economy -- you know, $5 billion is a lot of money but it's a relatively small percent. What would the effect be if we break the spending cap for, say, just $5 billion and we still had a surplus? Is there going to be any harm to that?
MR. GREENSPAN: The absolute amount is really beside the point. It probably doesn't matter whether it's $5 (billion) or $50 (billion). It's the principle. It's the extent to which the confidence that has been built up in the financial community about the integrity of our fiscal process is crucially important to this society and this economy. And all you have to do is to give indications that you're going back to the old ways in which we used to do things and the markets will immediately extrapolate that small wedge into a significantly negative view of the outlook. So the number is not relevant. It's the principle that's crucially involved.
REP. MILLER: So you think there could be an impact on the stock market or the interest rates in this country by just a little small break in that dam?
MR. GREENSPAN: It's what the markets perceive as to the implications of what you're doing. I find it hard, since the skepticism has been so general for so many decades, that you'll be able to have a small amount. I don't think credibility is built up to a point where there is that degree of trust yet in the marketplace. So I would be very careful.
There is a very big difference between zero and 1, much less difference between 1 and 100, if I may put it that way. I exaggerate but only to make a point.
REP. MILLER: Thank you very much for your very strong statement on that position.
One of the areas that the president has tried to use for additional spending is the tobacco tax. And I don't know how much you've addressed that issue or evaluated that issue, that there's serious discussion up to $1.50 per pack on cigarettes. Now, I'm not pro-tobacco, but what is the economic impact of something like that and how should it be used, as far as the progressivity or the regressivity of that type of tax, versus, you know, spending the money or, you know -- how should it be used? I mean, there may be some social cause why we want to raise the tax to discourage teenage smoking, though we may create a black market, but it raises some, you know, beneficial side effect.
What would you -- the economic benefit, who would be hurt, who would gain, and how should we use that revenue?
MR. GREENSPAN: I think that smokers will lose. I think I'm safe in making that statement. Tax coffers will increase. What one does with it is a political judgment. And I can't add anything to the conversation on that, which is very thoughtful.
REP. MILLER: You mentioned about the tax revenues, I mean, one of the things that's helped us reach the point we have as far as our surplus. Last year we cut capital gains and it was retroactive back to, I think it was May. Have you had a chance to evaluate whether that capital gains tax cut has generated more money even though it was a tax cut, or what impact that has had yet? MR. GREENSPAN: We don't know yet, because we don't have the April returns, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. There is, however, a suspicion that a significant part of this so-called tax surprise is a consequence, either directly of capital gains tax realizations as a consequence of the cut, or indirect impact of stock market gains on bonuses, payments, a variety of other sources of taxable income, which relates to the level of the stock market.
We won't really have a good fix until the 1040s are tabulated in the statistics of income and we have a full detail dissipation(?) of the liability into tax outlay -- into tax payments. But at the moment the general suspicion is that there is an element of that clearly in those numbers.
REP. MILLER: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
REP. KASICH: Mr. Doggett is recognized for five minutes.
REP. LLOYD DOGGETT (D-TX): (Off mike) -- national debt?
MR. GREENSPAN: I would.
REP. DOGGETT: And that accordingly that even a goal that would be as desirable as cutting taxes that you think should be cut on a particular subject, that those would be less desirable than proceeding to apply every penny to reducing the national debt?
MR. GREENSPAN: I would say that there are great numbers of initiatives which I think would be very useful with a significant surplus -- the chairman's Social Security one, notions of cutting marginal tax rates, I would say are all very valuable ideas.
I would let the surplus build up first. And one of the reasons is the point I made earlier, namely, once you get a surplus up there, it's got its own virtuous circle mechanism, which means it's working towards an ever higher number so that if you're skimming off the top, later on you get more than if you skim off the top very early on. In other words, the arithmetic of the way the system functions is if you wait a few years, the payoff is much larger, whereas if you try to use the surplus, so to speak, right away, you'll find out that there's not much there.
REP. DOGGETT: And as far as any of the unexpected and perhaps still improbable dollars that might flow from a tobacco settlement, I understand your answer to Mr. Miller to be that this is -- how that's used is essentially a political judgment of the best way to apply it, and that the use of that money would not be in violation of any domestic discretionary spending caps.
MR. GREENSPAN: No, no, I would -- if you ask my impression as to what I would like to happen -- there was a 65 billion or something of that nature? -- if you could apply that against the deficit, that would be just fine as far as -- to allow it go to the surplus, that would be just fine with me as a central banker. But I recognize that this is not just a simple budgetary issue; this has got all sorts of bells and whistles associated with it. And I have nothing to add to the notions of what the administration and the Congress would like to do with that money, because it's part of a broader package.
REP. DOGGETT: With regard to the International Monetary Fund, across the political spectrum there have been a number of proposals and ideas advanced on reforms in that fund, such as reducing the degree of secrecy, addressing the issue of what some call crony capitalism.
What reforms, if any, appear realistic to you as we consider the level of the US commitment to the International Monetary Fund?
MR. GREENSPAN: Well, I think it's important first of all to fully understand what are the causes of the crises that arise. In other words, why did something which appeared to be a mere minor problem on the horizon all of a sudden burst forth as a very significant crisis, which -- despite the fact that there may be people out there who think they forecast it, did not?
And there are reasons why it happened that way and why those are very difficult things to forecast.
Before we become overly certain of precisely what types of reform are required -- and I have no doubt that there are significant ones that are going to be required -- we ought to have a sense of what the cause of the problems are and how the mechanism works. There is no question that the issue of so-called transparency has been a crucial issue, because if you do not have clear signals as to the way markets are functioning, market capitalism can't work. You cannot have a system in which there is an open market, so to speak, for consumer choices in an economy but significant government-directed production. You're going to end up with huge surpluses or huge shortages. And the system will ultimately break down because the financial system will break down.
All of those are very clearly evident in this particular crisis, and many other things such as government guarantees and the problems of (moral hazard ?) which have occurred as a consequence of that -- in other words, it's been our experience that it's not been so much the IMF which has created these expectations of being bailed out; it's been governments who essentially have created a sense that if you're a foreigner and invest in that country, you are effectively investing in sovereign credit, because if the private debt goes wrong the government will be there to bail you out.
So that type of thing clearly has to be addressed because the system is not in equilibrium when those conditions exist. And we have to confront the broader sets of questions. And I don't think we are as yet in a position to make clear-cut, definitive decisions relative to what that system would look like. I think we've made very substantial progress in the last two or three months, but I don't think we're there yet.
REP. DOGGETT: What would be the --
REP. KASICH: The gentleman's time has expired, I'm sorry.
REP. DOGGETT: Thank you.
REP. KASICH: The gentleman from Wisconsin, Mr. Neumann, is recognized.
REP. MARK NEUMANN (R-WI): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you for being here, Mr. Greenspan. We certainly respect your testimony.
As recently as last night, I heard a very respected member of Congress say something to the effect that we are at the end of our economic boom cycle and we are certainly overdue for a recession. And as a matter of fact, when I look at CBO projections and I look at the growth rate of revenue to the federal government in CBO projections, they've dropped the revenue growth rate from 8.7 that it was last year down to an expected growth rate of 5.4 this year and as lower as 2.9 as they start projecting forward.
And I would like to lay out and suggest that at least we have the possibility that, instead of being at the back end of an expansion cycle in the normal expansion cycle that we've come to expect in our economy, is there a reasonable degree of probability that we are not in uncharted waters, and in fact that the change from the government borrowing $250 billion out of the private sector, which is where we were as recently as three or four years ago, to now today, where the government is not -- and it's not only in fact not borrowing out of the private sector but not renewing notes and effectively returning money to the private sector -- would it be fair to say that that's uncharted waters and that perhaps we are not at the end of our economic cycle but perhaps in these uncharted waters, at least there's a reasonable degree of possibility that we're at the front end of an economic expansion cycle because of this dramatic change?
MR. GREENSPAN: Well, congressman, actually it's not uncharted waters. Indeed, prior to the 1930s, through all of our history, those were the conditions. And indeed, in the early post-World War II period, we did have conditions in fiscal system not terribly different from what we are looking at.
But I do think there is an issue that you're raising which is important. There is something different about this one. As I said the other day, to I think it was the Senate committee, we're looking at an economy which has gone seven years into an expansion going into the eighth year, and contrary to historical experience, instead of imbalances arising, it's becoming increasingly benign. That is, the inflation rate continues to fall, the risk premiums on various different financial instruments are being narrowed, there's a sense of tranquillity and confidence out there which we haven't seen in a very substantial period of time.
Now, some people read that as dangerous in the sense that there's only one direction it can go is down, because -- but that's not what's happened. I mean, what's happened is it's gotten continuously better.
Does that mean that the business cycle is dead? I doubt that very much. Does it mean that because we've gone seven years, which is very long in any cycle, that there's a certain element of longevity which inevitably creates an automatic decline? The answer is no. I think that what we don't see is any geriatric strain, if I may put it that way. The economy looks as though it's just started its recovery in many respects.
REP. NEUMANN: Well, I guess that's my point. When we look at the projections as laid out by both CBO and OMB, they're effectively projecting a major, a significant downturn in the growth rate of revenues to the federal government as compared to last year or last three years or last five years even. And I would like to suggest that contrary to the conversations that we've been having here, there is at least a reasonably high degree of probability that in fact they have dramatically missed their estimation on the light side, on the down side. That is to say that our surpluses could in fact be much more significant than what they have suggested, or at least there is a reasonable degree of probability that that may occur.
MR. GREENSPAN: I think that's right. I think that the decline in their revenue projections, or the growth in projections, is not so much an expected decline in the economy or in slowing down in nominal GDP growth, but an expectation of these very huge, non-withheld, individual income tax supplies, which has really started every revenue forecaster in the last couple of years; that that's a short-term phenomenon, that basically it's related to the growth in stock prices, that stock prices growth according to their projections implicitly will slow down, that capital gains realizations will fall, that a number of these special, very sharp increases in bonuses related to the market will not continue to increase.
REP. NEUMANN: But, see, therein lies what I'm pointing out here. It seems to me -- and you accurately pointed out that in past history we've been in this spot. But in modern history, in the last 30 years, we have not been in a spot where the government has not reached into the private sector and taken capital out of the private sector for purposes of funding government programs.
We are in that spot right now today. And, in fact, is it not at least possible that the expectations for a continuing boom in our economic cycle, everything you just described, that it may, in fact, continue the way it has, because of a change in our policy in terms of affecting the private sector; that is, taking money out of the private sector?
Isn't it reasonable to conclude that had the government this year borrowed $250 billion out of the private sector, run a $250 billion deficit, that we would be in a significantly different economic picture than what we're in? That tranquillity you described would not exist. Interest rates would be higher. I mean, a lot of things would be different. And I guess my point is that because we are in this new environment that we have not seen in modern times, at least, that the potential exists that we're going to keep right on booming in this cycle.
MR. GREENSPAN: I agree with that, Congressman. The potential is there. And I think that because of the uncertainty of fiscal forecasts that it's hard to know where the numbers are coming out. This is one of the reasons why, in my prepared remarks, I raised questions about how much we know about all this and one of the reasons why I just like to emphasize that it will not be the end of the world if we make a mistake and the surpluses pile up far faster than we anticipate.
In other words, there is no real concern of fiscal drag out there that must be addressed. In other words, you don't have to fend off potential very large surpluses for fear it'll impact negatively on the economy. I haven't heard that, but I will guarantee that we'll begin to hear something of that nature. So that the answer is yes, we may see that. I think at that point it's the type of problem which I think we ought to be quite pleased in having to resolve.
REP. KASICH: The gentleman's time has expired.
REP. NEUMANN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
REP. KASICH: The chairman will not be able to come back. I mean, he does have some other things he's got to do. And David Minge is up and then Chris Shays. And I wondered, we probably have about six or seven minutes; if you'd keep in mind that what you take, you're taking from Mr. Shays. REP. NEUMANN: Mr. Minge, one --
REP. KASICH: Oh, and unanimous consent that Mrs. Roybal-Allard's questions be submitted for the record. Without objection, so approved.
REP. DAVID MINGE (D-MN): Mr. Chairman, I would echo what's been said by others. We really appreciate your willingness to appear before this committee and share with us your insights. I have a couple of quick questions I'd like to ask.
First of all, with respect to Social Security, we face the prospect of tens of millions of Americans cashing in their chips at about the same time in the 2020-2030 era. And I'm just wondering if you have any advice that you can give us as to how we can try to plan for this tremendous drain on the U.S. government and on the economy when we have the baby-boom generation trying to live out its life in a very comfortable, affluent style. Is paying down on the debt the best thing we can do, or do you have some other suggestions that you could make as we embark on this task of planning for this problem?
MR. GREENSPAN: Well, to the extent that the demographics are such that in real terms we see that the resources on which the baby- boom generation, when it retires, is going to have to have a claim, it's a very big chunk of real resources. There are no finances that's going to cleverly finance that. What you need is real productivity growth.
And to the extent that you get accelerated productivity, you can solve this problem without very considerable drain. If you don't get significant productivity growth, I don't care what type of financing you get yourself involved with; it's going to be tough.
Productivity comes from two sources: One, from savings which are put into investment, and the other is from technology changes which makes the capital you invest in more efficient. We have, in fact, got the second going fairly well at this stage. The actual productivity of capital, if I may put it that way, is really quite impressive in the last couple of years.
We don't have the savings. Indeed, household savings is at its lowest level in many, many decades. So what we need is to augment the system in a manner to create savings. And one reason why I would like to see the surplus start to really build up is that it creates the type of savings which will effectively impact on long-term productivity.
I'd also argue in favor of a privatization of the Social Security system, because I believe that, too, can augment private savings, properly handled. So the issue here is very important to make certain we're focusing on real assets, real goods. What do people need? Food, clothing, shelter. And we're not going to get it by financial legerdemain, if I may put it that way. REP. MINGE: The other thing -- and I'd just like to make this as a statement and not ask for your response, in deference to Mr. Shays -- we have tens of millions of Americans that are left out of this prosperity and we have a multigenerational underclass. They are earning wages which are not much different than entry-level wages after working in manufacturing, food processing plants for several years. They can't afford the housing that exists in the communities where they live or where they work, and there's not day care available for their children if they are working anything other than a standard, let's say, 7:00 in the morning to 6:00 in the evening time frame.
So we really, from my perspective, have another challenge here. And I hope there's another day when we have a chance to explore some of your thoughts on that. Thank you.
REP. KASICH: Mr. Shays.
REP. CHRIS SHAYS (R-CT): Thank you. Mr. Chairman, sometimes I think of you as speaking in tongues, so I have to pay close attention. But I think you were pretty direct. And my concern is that even when we still talk of a surplus, we still have the federal funds deficit. We're borrowing from our trust funds. We're balancing the flow of money in with the flow of money out. But we still, from a budgetary accountant standpoint, still have what I would call a deficit.
I'm concerned that people in my side of the aisle and the other side of the aisle, some look at this surplus that doesn't yet exist and they want to see tax cuts; they want to see more money for defense. Democrats, some tend to want to see more on social programs. And both sides of the aisle want to see more money for roads and bridges, which to me ends up causing tremendous harm to the effort to balance our budget.
My question is this: With the increased growth in revenue, I take the view that we should have debt reduction with the natural growth in revenue. With the new revenue that the president has proposed, I take the position that we should net it out and have a tax cut for any new revenue he comes in with and that any new spending should be funded out of existing entitlement and non-entitlement programs. Is that a position that you would be comfortable with or uncomfortable with?
MR. GREENSPAN: If you can implement it, I think it would create a fairly sound fiscal situation.
REP. SHAYS: Thank you.
REP. KASICH: Well, Mr. Chairman, I know this was done on short notice. I think that today -- I mean, we've all listened to you, but today you were really very direct. And we very much appreciate your taking the time to come up here, and we look forward to seeing you very soon. And say hello to your wife for me. The hearing is adjourned. MR. GREENSPAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Say hello to your wife, too. (Laughter.)
REP. KASICH: I'll do it.
