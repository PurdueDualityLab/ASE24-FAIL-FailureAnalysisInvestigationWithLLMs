Opening Statement of Chairwoman Constance A. Morella Government Wide Year 2000 Issues and the Department of Treasury March 18, 1998 Today we are heralding the beginning of a new era in our nation's ability to timely and effectively correct the Year 2000 problem. With the arrival of John Koskinen to chair the newly created President's Council on the Year 2000 Conversion, a ray of hope is now piercing through the clouds of doubt and gloom that had shrouded over questions about the readiness of our public and private sectors to be Year 2000 compliant by the beginning of the new millennium. Mr. Koskinen brings to his new position a level of experience and a skill for government management that has very few peers. I am also very pleased that Sally Katzen, with her institutional knowledge and background on this issue, has accepted the role of Vice Chair of the Council. Additionally, the Council will be well served with the technical expertise of federal Chief Information Officers and the very capable Office of Management and Budget staff. Yet, while I have great faith and confidence in the Council's abilities and motivation to get the job done by the immovable deadline of January 1,2000, I just hope it's not too late. The job before the Council is both gargantuan and thankless, and the Executive Branch, to paraphrase Robert Frost, still has many promises to keep and miles to go before it can sleep. I don't need to remind the Council that as we ring in the 21st Century, we will be ushering in the mother of all computer glitches - one which could cripple critical government functions, such as air traffic control systems, veterans' benefits, Social Security, and student loans, as well as the everyday conveniences of modern life, like home security systems, video recorders, and elevators in high-rise buildings. It is clear that without greater urgency and aggressive agency management, federal agencies are at risk of being unable to provide services or to perform functions that are critical to their mission and vital to the American public. The reports that we have received from federal agencies, and our own Congressional reviews, are quite disturbing, prompting many to grimly cast dire predictions about the failure of the government and industry to operate effectively on the first business day of the new millennium, Monday, January 3,2000. That is why we have urged the President for over a year to forcefully attack this impending catastrophe. We repeatedly appealed to him to create a Year 2000 Czar with the mandate of making solving the problem the highest priority for both the public and private sector. At last, with his Executive Order forming the Council, the President has finally given this issue the attention it deserves. Now that this important step has been undertaken, I am looking forward to working collaboratively with the Council to do everything we can to avert catastrophic failure of government and industry computer systems. Minimizing the Year 2000 problem will require a major technological and managerial effort. Not only must the Council act to ensure that no critical federal program experiences disruption because of the problem, but it must also: assist state and local governments; cooperate with the private sector in important national and local systems, including the financial, telecommunications, health, transportation, and energy sectors; as well as communicate with our international allies to raise awareness and generate cooperative international arrangements to address the problem. In the coming months, I intend to work very closely with the Council, especially assisting in the development of initiatives to ensure that the private sector is moving forward with necessary dispatch. Meanwhile, Congress - not just the Science Committee and the Government Reform and Oversight Committee, but also a number of other committees - will continue to hold hearings to determine the scope and impact of the problem on the American public and to monitor agency progress. The Council and Congress must jointly seek solutions. It is clear that we cannot meet a new era of opportunities, if two years from now, our nation's computers are moving backwards instead of forward We must create a new paradigm of collaboration, for we all know that we are facing an unforgiving deadline and time is running out. The American people are expecting no less from us.
