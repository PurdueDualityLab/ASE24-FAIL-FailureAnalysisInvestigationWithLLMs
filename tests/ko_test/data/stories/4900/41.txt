California finally opens electricity market to competition

After a three-month delay caused by computer glitches, California opened its $ 28 billion electricity market to competition in a step designed to lower prices and improve service.
Electricity sold on the open market was to begin flowing to homes and businesses today after a computer command switched control of the power lines from utilities to the new Independent Service Operator.
'It works. We're ready to go,' said Jeffrey Tranen, chief executive of the ISO, an independent agency responsible for transmitting electricity to consumers.
On Tuesday, buying and selling of electricity began at the California Power Exchange, the ISO's sister agency, in the Los Angeles suburb of Alhambra.
In a room jammed with computers, Power Exchange traders handled about 50 bids representing slightly more than $ 10 million worth of electricity, or 510,923 megawatt hours, sold at an average wholesale price of $ 19.73 per megawatt hour.
'The market in California is open,' said Dennis Loughridge, chief executive of the nonprofit Power Exchange. 'I do believe this to be a historic accomplishment.'
Deregulation of the energy market originally was scheduled to begin Jan. 1. But it was delayed for three months because of glitches in software that enables the exchange to transmit sales information to the ISO.
Officials at both agencies said the problems had been resolved during three months of testing.
For residential consumers, the transformation to a competitive market means that they can pick an electricity provider much in the way they now pick a long-distance telephone carrier.
In reality, however, few are likely to notice the change. Most new providers entering the California market are focusing their marketing campaigns on big commercial users - those with the biggest bills and greatest potential for profit.
'The biggest concern right now is the amount of competition and the quality of competition,' said Charles Carbone of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. 'There are already two unequal markets: the business market, being moderately competitive, and the residential market, being minimally competitive.'
Consumers who don't pick a new provider will continue to receive power from their local utility as they did in the past. They also will continue to receive a 10 percent rate reduction that began Jan. 1 as mandated by legislation that moved the state toward deregulation.
The rate reduction will remain in effect for all residential and small business consumers until 2002. Proponents of deregulation contend that rates will drop another 20 percent or more by that time because the utilities will be clear of their so-called stranded costs - the cost of unprofitable investments such as nuclear power plants.
