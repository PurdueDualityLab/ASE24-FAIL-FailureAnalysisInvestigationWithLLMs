Is compliance Y2K compliant? (bank compliance function; Year 2000)

Most of the talk about Year 2000 has involved making sure your bank is in compliance with the century turnover. It's far less common for bankers to get into the impact of the Year 2000 on their bank's compliance function.
ABA Banking Journal spoke to a range of bankers, vendors, and consultants noted for their expertise in bank compliance to find out what compliance officers ought to be worrying about and looking at as the Year 2000 nears.
Some of the folks we interviewed were skeptical, believing that Compliance is wholly dependent on each bank's central effort to make sure systems and software will handle the century change correctly. Those whose institutions had already been running tests, had found that some systems, such as mortgage processing packages, already had solutions built in. And in other cases, compliance-related functions typically are handled with personal computers, which often are Year 2000 compliant.
However, when you dig deeper, there are issues compliance officers need to stay on top of lest their banks, because of a Year 2000 problem elsewhere, trigger a bread-and-butter compliance violation.
For example, deep within one of the Federal Reserve's early advisories on the Year 2000 (SR 97-29), banks are admonished to consider Compliance as a mission critical" function that should be tested and ready prior to the turnover. As an example, the Fed cites truth in lending Regulation Z) compliance as an example f the type of function that could be affected if an open-end credit system has Year 2000 glitches. Other areas the Fed cited as concerns included the Expedited Funds Availability Act (Reg CC); the Electronic Funds Transfer Act (Reg E); the Flood Disaster Protection Act (Reg H); the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (Reg C); reserve requirements (Reg D); consumer leasing (Reg M); truth in savings (Reg DD); the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (Reg X); the Fair Credit Reporting Act; the Deceptive Practices Act (Reg AA); and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (Reg B).
Many of these laws and regulations require that banks adhere to notice periods after having taken certain actions. The more automated a bank's compliance effort in any such area, the more critical it is that Compliance be sure its part of the processing be ready and tested.
Failure to adopt systems for the Year 2000 "could have an impact on notifications made to customers," says Michelle Feeley, Feeley Associates, Allentown, Pa.
The Fed noted in SR 97-29 that examiners have been instructed to consider Compliance when reviewing bank preparedness for the Year 2000. Here are some issues to watch:
* Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. This is the subject of one of the clearest compliance-related guidelines from the agencies. In the Feb. 25 Federal Register the Federal Reserve published proposed rules, that, in part, address HMDA compliance in light of the Year 2000. (The comment period ends on April 27.)
Up until now, when banks recorded the date of covered loan applications and the date action was taken on the applications, the dates were entered in two-digit format. The Fed noted it is modifying the software it makes available to banks to accommodate four-digit format for dates, and that it is changing paper HMDA loan application register forms to track this. (Similar changes are being made to Community Reinvestment Act software.) The Fed plans to make the new reporting requirement effective for loans made this year, which will be reported in early 1999. The Fed is proceeding, it noted, on the assumption that private HMDA software vendors have or will amend their packages accordingly. Compliance officers will want to verify this.
* Truth in lending/Truth in savings. Truth in lending software has been around for years; truth in savings regulations are newer, but were substantially patterned after the older law's model. Compliance officers should verify that the package they use can handle the Year 2000. Alan Dombrow, known to many as "Dr. Z" for his expertise with truth in lending, wrote a widely used software package when he was with the Comptroller's Office. He says this package can handle Year 2000 dates. Even so, compliance officers should check packages.
* Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. RESPA is chock full of date issues. Dombrow, who is now senior manager and federal regulatory liaison with CFI ProServices, Inc., Portland, Ore., says a Year 2000 glitch in RESPA software could wreak havoc with a bank's compliance. "It might be 100 years before the disclosures kick out of the computer," says Dombrow. On the other hand, RESPA-covered loans made near the turn of the century could be disbursed too quickly if date routines go awry- RESPA requires a waiting period to allow for the right of rescission.
* Equal Credit Opportunity. Adverse action notices for lending must be provided to customers within 30 days of rejection. A noncompliant package could foul up the timing on such notices.
* Flood insurance. Processing packages designed to remind bankers when flood policies expire, renew, etc., depend on accurate date processing. Banks that run their own software must make sure these routines still work accurately. Those banks that rely on outside vendors must be sure the vendors' software will follow through after 2000.
* Web sites. Compliance with consumer protection laws is a problem for many bank Web sites, according to Richard Insley, a former bank compliance officer who now runs APR Systems, Inc., Richmond, Va. Insley is noted for his expertise in Internet matters and has found, in surveying Web sites, that compliance officers rarely seem to have been consulted. Thus sites that use loan calculators or display forms often are not even in compliance with basic rules, let alone ready for the Year 2000.
* Forms vendors. While it may seem mundane, Insley warns that banks that depend on outside suppliers for forms must be certain that these vendors won't be crippled by a Year 2000 glitch. Such vendors' inventory controls, and such, could go haywire when the century turns, he suggests, and some of the forms such banks depend on from outsiders carry regulatory deadlines for providing them to a bank's customers.
* Good faith protections. A number of consumer protection rules contain provisions allowing regulators to waive penalties for noncompliance due to bad data processing, provided that the bank is using the software in good faith.
Truth in lending and truth in savings rules both provide such protections from "bona fide" errors. Among other rules that contain similar provisions are the Expedited Funds Availability Act; the Consumer Credit Protection Act; and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. However, some rules don't contain such protections; one example is RESPA. And some say that the protections that are provided may not be all that broad.
And "good faith" does not mean accepting a vendor's certification that the software will work and crossing one's fingers and hoping for the best. "'Good faith' means you need to test your software against either another calculation tool or against an example you know is correct," says Dombrow.
One last consideration is the role Compliance is and will be playing in each bank's broader Year 2000 effort. Compliance consultant Lucy Griffin of Compliance Resources, Inc., Falls Church, Va., points out that compliance officers, who must always take an institution-wide view when assessing regulatory risk, are well-suited for assisting in the general Year 2000 effort.
"The Year 2000 is, in fact, a classic compliance project," says Griffin. "It involves taking stock of a problem with a deadline that can't be moved, figuring out all the parts of the organization that will be affected, and marshalling resources to handle it. Compliance managers are experienced 'matrix managers' who know how to work within a traditional pyramidal structure." BJ
