Texas' Move to HMO-Type Medicaid Causes Confusion, But Might Cut Costs

THE HOUSTON CHRONICLE
ln
When Mildred Boyd received a two-pound package of health insurance papers in the mail last November from the state of Texas, she didn't bother to read it.
'I didn't understand it,' confessed the 24-year-old single Houston mother. 'And I passed it on to my mom.'
Boyd's son, Jeffrey, is a 7-year-old Medicaid recipient, who was born with only one ear and suffers from diabetes and a brain tumor. Boyd's mother, Pat Engleman, a 51-year-old courier driver, said she was too busy to help her decipher the puzzling information.
Tossing the packet aside proved to be a mistake that resulted in panic, confusion and anger weeks later when Boyd took Jeffrey to the doctor. She discovered then that she couldn't pay with her Medicaid card.
'I was told Jeffrey's not on Medicaid. I was upset,' Boyd recalled.
Things eventually worked out. But for Boyd and Engleman, it was an unsettling experience -- one that many of Harris County's Medicaid families have or will have to grapple with as the conversion from traditional Medicaid to an HMO-type Medicaid takes place.
Low-income families who once received health care under the decades-old Medicaid system had to choose by Feb. 15 one of seven state-selected managed care plans.
For many, the transition has been a frustrating and confusing one, especially for those who speak little or no English.
But advocates of the new system say once it's in place statewide by September 2002, it will be well worth it to Medicaid recipients -- and taxpayers.
Supporters claim it will save a net 5 percent on Medicaid expenses -- a tab paid by state and federal taxpayers -- and increase access to medical care for the poor of Texas.
Critics, however, charge the Texas conversion is an untried experiment that ultimately will erode the quality of care for Medicaid recipients.
Whatever happens in the coming year, clues as to what to expect can be found in conversions that have taken place elsewhere in Texas and in other states.
As medical costs have continued to rise and taxpayers balk at increased taxes, state legislatures across the nation have sought out approaches to decrease Medicaid costs.
Just as in the private sector, managed health care has seemed the way out. So far, more than half of all states have converted their Medicaid recipients to some form of managed health care.
In Texas, the rate of increase in total Medicaid spending had been rising faster than the national rate, averaging 12 percent per year from 1992 to 1995, compared with 9.9 percent nationally.
Faced with rising costs and taxpayer resistance, it should be no surprise that the Texas Legislature gave managed care a shot in 1995 when it passed Senate Bill 10, mandating the conversion.
So far, in addition to Harris County, the conversions have been done in the Medicaid services areas of Liberty, Hardin, Orange, Travis, Bexar, Tarrant, and Lubbock counties. Chambers, Jefferson and Galveston counties got a jump on the others, as they participated in the state's pilot program that began Dec. 1, 1993.
Once it is fully in place, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission estimates managed care savings for 1997 to be $18.8 million; for 1998, $55.2 million; and for 1999, $83 million.
To bolster their argument, Texas health officials point to other states that have realized Medicaid savings by adopting a managed care system.
Arizona, which never had traditional Medicaid but instead created a health care cost containment system, offers Medicaid recipients a choice of 13 HMOs across the state, said Frank Lopez, a spokesman for Arizona's health department.
Its annual per capita cost has increased 23 percent under this system, compared with a 38 percent increase in nearby states with traditional Medicaid.
In California, one of the biggest Medicaid states with 5 million recipients, managed care programs were implemented to improve beneficiaries' access to care -- but not specifically to save money, says Ken August, a spokesman with the California Department of Health Services. A two-plan model was mandated by the state in 1993.
'We haven't seen any savings, but we expect over time that rising costs will be less,' August said.
In the Harris County rollout, completed Feb. 15, all Medicaid families were to have chosen one of seven health plans -- six health maintenance organization plans and one called a primary care case management plan.
From now on, Medicaid families, who in the past could go to any doctor or specialist who accepted Medicaid, will have to choose a doctor from a list supplied by a managed care provider, or HMO, and face certain limitations on how or when to seek treatment.
Medicaid recipients under this new HMO system will see the same doctors as those who participate in HMOs at work. The big difference is that the tab for Medicaid-HMO participants will be picked up by the taxpayers.
The deadline by which these families were to have picked a plan had been extended twice.
All those who had not chosen an HMO plan were assigned a family doctor -or primary care physician -- by the state earlier this month.
Doctors were assigned based on the patient's history, proximity of doctor's office to patient's residence and a percentage that kept the mix of defaulted enrollments similar to elected enrollments.
The Harris County rollout -- in which a market was converted within a defined period -- was far more ambitious than most states' more gradual phase-ins.
'The faster you do this, the faster you realize whatever budgetary savings you will have,' said Don Moran, senior vice president of The Lewin Group, a Washington, D.C., health care research and consulting firm. 'It's better to have enrollment occur simultaneously so (health care) companies can compete on a level playing field. But the faster you can accomplish that, the more formidable a challenge in bringing up a market this big.'
Reaching the Medicaid community presented a plethora of hurdles -- it is a mobile population whose members often moved in with other families, making it hard for officials to track them and mail information. Many spoke only Spanish or could not read.
The state depended heavily on community groups and neighborhood clinics to get the word out that Medicaid was changing.
In Houston, 80 percent of those eligible for Medicaid are children, said Anne Helton, Texas Children's Hospital's director of community health promotion.
'We're talking about lots and lots of kids that could fall through the cracks,' said Helton, whose staff designed bilingual brochures to distribute. 'We have found that families find their way to our emergency room no matter what plan they have. We have attempted to educate the community in a wide manner, knowing a lot of families may choose an HMO we were not participating with. It's going to be a nightmare because these families can change plans every 30 days.'
Of the 121,625 Medicaid recipients in Harris County in March, about 22,000 failed to choose a plan and were enrolled in one chosen by the state.
The rest -- about 82 percent -- voluntarily chose one of the seven plans, says Eric Baumgartner, chief of the bureau of managed care at the Texas Department of Health. He added that these numbers are a snapshot in time and final figures may differ as Medicaid clients are processed and the agency completes its analysis.
But about 25 percent of the enrollees chose a plan that works similarly to the traditional Medicaid system -- the primary care case management plan.
Under this plan, clients must choose a primary care physician but also can go directly to a specialist who accepts Medicaid. Physicians are paid by the state on a fee-for-service basis -- just as they would be under traditional Medicaid. In addition, they receive a case management fee of $3 per person under their primary care.
So how does the state expect this primary care case management model to save money?
Under the case management model an administrator will do concurrent reviews, making sure patients are receiving appropriate care and not overusing services, said Duane Keeran, director of operations at the state's Bureau of Managed Care.
In addition, there's greater emphasis on authorization of services than under traditional Medicaid.
But Keeran added that since the case management model is based on fee for services, it 'is prone to the same problems of cost as fee for service in the traditional Medicaid. It's just a moderation of that.'
So far, despite clients such as Boyd who found the small-print brochures and charts baffling and intimidating, state officials and HMO administrators are calling this latest rollout of managed care relatively successful.
'Frankly, the Harris County rollout has gone a lot smoother than the other ones,' says Michael McKinney, commissioner of the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. Harris County's problems have been mild compared to San Antonio's. San Antonio, which began its conversion in September 1996, had, by most accounts, one of the worst rollouts, plagued by logistical nightmares.
Rather than allowing families to start as soon as they chose a plan, all of San Antonio's Medicaid families started on the same day.
Computer snafus were common. A man could have been assigned to a gynecologist, or an adult to a pediatrician. Children in the same family often were given different physicians. Doctors complained of late payments by the HMOs.
To avoid what happened in San Antonio, the state hired an outside enrollment broker, Maximus of McLean, Va., which has started Medicaid managed care programs from California to Connecticut.
Maximus received a 27-month contract that could pay up to $30 million to implement managed care programs across the state.
Texas created a checklist to grade the performance of the health plans. In its 'readiness review,' the state monitored the health companies' ability to provide a network of doctors, enroll patients and make timely payments to doctors.
'We have every confidence we will not see anywhere near the problems we saw last year,' said Baumgartner of the Texas Department of Health.
Dr. Regina F. Kyles, the chief executive officer and medical director of People First Healthcare Network, a group of independent private doctors in Houston, applauds the introduction as a cooperative one where glitches were resolved quickly.
'There's going to be some confusion,' said Kyles. 'The key is education of the Medicaid recipient. It's ongoing. We're continuing to educate the patients when they have questions about where to go. They have to get accustomed to having their primary care physician serve as their medical home, instead of going to the emergency room for a sore throat.'
Managed care supporters claim this system of health care gives poor families access to the same medical care as the middle class.
For the first time, they argue, these often mobile families will have their 'own' doctor -- one physician who will chart their children's medical histories, coordinate their care, and offer preventive care such as 'well baby' checkups.
For example, one of the plans, HMO Blue, says it offers dental care to the mothers of Medicaid children, to encourage the moms to come in with their kids for regular dental checkups. It also provides 50 styles of designer knockoff eyeglasses -- a contrast from the standard black frames most Medicaid patients receive, says David Bick, vice president of HMO Blue.
Jim Donovan, president and chief executive officer of Americaid, another of the plans, insists managed health care is not solely driven by the bottom line.
'If your goal is something other than improving the health status of the people you're servicing -- whether you're a physician or an HMO -- then you're not going to be successful,' he said. 'One of the goals of moving from fee-for-service to a managed care system is to open the opportunities for Medicaid members to a broad array of providers.'
Nevertheless, many Houston physicians are resisting this change to Medicaid HMOs and predict patients ultimately will suffer when they no longer can freely choose their physicians.
'Am I happy to see this? No, I'm not,' said Dr. William H. Mack, who has worked with Medicaid patients for the past 30 years. 'I think traditional Medicaid would have worked very well with a few injections of overhauling. We can get the numbers to say anything. Whether these are real when we start to look at patients suffering and transitioning -saving of money is not the real issue.'
Dr. Paul Handel, president of the Harris County Medical Society, calls the state's rollout a big experiment.
'Nobody really knows whether or not it's going to help the people it's designed to help. Or if it is truly going to save money while providing the services,' Handel said.
How well Medicaid managed care serves its clients ultimately depends on how states implement the program.
'When states and plans rush to implement, people don't have good information,' said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a national organization in Washington, D.C., for health care consumers. 'They don't know what they're doing. And often they don't enroll. Often if they do enroll, they have no clue where their doctor is or whether (the doctor) is in the plan. It causes real problems for people. States do save money. Managed care reduces utilization. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad.'
Boyd, for example, ended up calling the hospital where her son had been treated in the past -- Texas Children's Hospital -- and a social worker there helped her enroll in a health plan.
But Boyd said she still has no idea which health plan her son is on -she just shows up at the doctor's office with her new health card.
Pollack, whose group is a consultant for state governments, suggests Texas consider an ombudsman program in which Medicaid recipients can call a toll-free number for help from someone paid to represent patients.
By doing this, the state may be able to prevent the backlash that has arisen on the commercial side of HMOs, in which people feel powerless and unsure if their doctors -- who are employed by an HMO -- are giving them the facts and the best treatment they need, Pollack said.
In the meantime, Texas is continuing its rollout of Medicaid managed care. Dallas will get managed care in July and the Hill Country will get it in September.
Here in Houston, doctors, state officials and HMO administrators are adopting a wait-and-see attitude on how Medicaid managed care will play out in the next year.
'For the doctors who have seen Medicaid through the years, it probably will make no difference,' said Handel of the Harris County Medical Society. 'Doctors who have not historically taken care of Medicaid patients are in for a real eye-opener culturally. They're dealing now with issues, social problems.'
Christopher Born, president of Texas Children's Health Plan, a secondary HMO working with three of the state HMO plans, says he expects that a year from now Medicaid recipients will be healthier, with fewer barriers to health care.
But he admits, 'It's going to be difficult to predict how managed health care is going to shake out. It's going to be very, very difficult to make money in Medicaid. It's very expensive to take care of these children.'
