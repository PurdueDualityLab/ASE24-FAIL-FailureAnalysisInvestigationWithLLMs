SEN. ALFONSE D'AMATO (R-NY): Today the committee meets to begin its consideration of the nomination of Arthur Levitt to serve a second term as Chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. I believe that his record over the past five years speaks for itself. I plan to support his nomination and I feel quite confident that we will be able to move this nomination with broad bipartisan support, and probably unanimous support.
Let me say I have a longer statement to make. I will make that, but inasmuch as we are privileged to have the senior Senator from New York, my colleague and friend, Senator Moynihan, here to introduce Mr. Levitt. And again to say that Chairman Levitt needs no real introduction, but to formalize this in the manner in which it should be undertaken.
It is a great privilege and pleasure for me to recognize the senior Senator from New York to make that presentation.
Senator Moynihan.
SEN. DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN (D-NY): Thank you, Mr. Chairman, thank you Senator Reed.
I am here to do just that and with a sense of high honor and distinct privilege. It will shortly now be a half century that I have had the association with the Levitt family in New York State. Arthur Levitt's father was, for a quarter century, the distinguished controller of the state of New York and he passed on a quality of commitment to public service, which his son has fully fulfilled. Not fully fulfilled, aptly fulfilled. He was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Williams before joining the United States Air Force. He went on to be head of the American Stock Exchange. He's now been, for a full term, the head of the Securities, Chairman of the Securities Exchange Commission.
Two things, Mr. Chairman. One, he has made it his special concern, something new in the office, to protect the consumer. At a time when the Securities and Exchange Commission had to recognize that now a large proportion of the American public was in the stock market. It had previously been a rather exclusive group and it needed tending, but in a different way. He has expanded the concerns of the Commission in a way that we should all be grateful for and approve of.
Finally, sir, he is one of the most powerful voices in, not just the United States, but in the world in warning against the impending catastrophe of our computer systems when the year 2000 comes. He has said to me, and I will take the liberty of repeating it, he said that United States companies are in fairly good order but their foreign partners are not. And he has warned American firms that if your collaborators do not get in line on this, break off the collaboration that the American firms recognize that not to do this is terminal, what others do is going to be increasingly important world figure in the years ahead.
I commend him to this honorable committee. I thank you for the privilege of introducing him.
SEN. D'AMATO: Thank you, Senator. I don't know, I guess your schedule is one that's going to take you --
SEN. MOYNIHAN: -- far.

SEN. D'AMATO: Okay. Thank you, Senator. Before I can complete my remarks and turn to Senator Reed, acknowledge the presence of Commissioners Hunt, Commissioner, Commissioner Johnson and Commissioner Unger who joins us. We're privileged to have you here today.
The Securities Exchange Commission is charged with an important mission. Their mission is to protect the integrity of our capital markets. I think if we take time out to look to see what is taking place in Southeast Asia and in some other areas, it is because even great economies and countries heretofore that people looked at and marveled at the great success that they had, it is because they didn't have an SEC and standards that required corporations and those doing business to make the kinds of transparency openness that we take for granted in corporate America today, available for all to see and to know. And then we are shocked when we see the collapse of markets in Asia and in Japan that heretofore people marveled at. Now we hear of the tens and tens of billions of dollars that their securities firms and banking firms and other firms have hidden in losses and misappropriations in some cases.
And so Chairman Levitt, suffice it to say that it is because of your work, and your predecessors, that I believe, because we talked about how important it is to guarantee the integrity of our marketplace, that those examples of failures of governments to do so and to provide these protections, protections that we take for granted in this country, is part of the reason for the great economic renaissance, so to speak, here in this country. The prosperity that we enjoy, in no small part, comes about as a result of your work and seeing to it that there is the ability to make judgements and investments and to keep the marketplaces such that people feel confident. That's part of the reason why people throughout the world and people who have capital and money say where do you invest? More and more apparent, you want to have a good investment, you want to know that the odds aren't stacked against you, it's in the United States. I'd like to just make mention of that.
As we look forward to continuing the constructive relationships that this committee has had, I can think of no one better to head the Securities Exchange Commission. We are working on legislation on the Uniform Standards Act and let me take this opportunity to thank you, Chairman Levitt, for the Commission's cooperation on this legislation and I'm pleased to announce that the Commission and the Committee have come to terms on a number of outstanding issues. Because Congress can't just write legislation without looking to the people who are on the front line, or from the private sector and the regulators we call upon to enforce these laws.
So therefore we have had this very cooperative effort and as Chairman of the Banking Committee, I'm grateful to the Commission and its staff for their thoughtful recommendations and expert advice. Not only on this legislation, but on many of the legislative activities and endeavors that we have undertaken. And as a result of this cooperation, we were able to improve this important legislation and as a result of that process, the Commission is now able to support this legislation and the Committee will move to mark up S1260 with the agreed upon amendments on April 19th. Let me say that the Securities Exchange Commission demonstrates a growing consensus on reform and I want to thank two of my colleagues, Senator Gramm and Senator Dodd for, just as you fear and the Lord, no. For their leadership, and Senator Dodd as I indicated, we will be holding a markup on your important legislative endeavors on April 29th.
(Off mike.)
SEN. D'AMATO: That's what they tell me here, April 29th.
Again, I want to thank Senator Dodd and Senator Gramm for their leadership in helping to build such a strong consensus behind a bill that both protects consumers and makes sure that the markets aren't subject to frivolous lawsuits. Chairman Levitt is being considered for his second term as Chairman. If he completes his second term he will have served longer than any other Chairman. I think that's quite an accomplishment and we thank you for your stewardship and for the great sacrifices that you have made. His willingness to continuing public service is to be commended.
Chairman Levitt continues a family tradition of no-nonsense public service that his father, the former New York State controller, Arthur Levitt, Senior, established. Again, I look forward to supporting Chairman Levitt's nomination and continuing to work with him and the entire SEC to promote the strength and integrity of our country's capital markets. Let me turn to Senator Reed.
Senator Reed?
SEN. JACK REED (D-RI): Mr. Chairman, just very briefly to amplify what you have said. Mr. Levitt has done a commendable job as Chairman of the Securities Exchange Commission and in doing so he's guaranteed the viability of our securities markets. One of the major reasons why our securities markets thrive is because of the oversight and the careful review provided by the SEC. And in that regard I would welcome him and commend him for his work.
I thank the Chairman.
SEN. D'AMATO: Thank you, Senator.
Senator Gramm.
SENATOR PHIL GRAMM (R-TX): Well Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for holding this hearing promptly. I'd like to join you in supporting the re-nomination of Arthur Levitt. I have had an opportunity to work with Arthur very closely as Chairman of the Securities Subcommittee and I would have to say, Mr. Chairman, that of all of the heads of the SEC that I have worked with, he has been more cooperative in terms of sitting down and talking to people. And more importantly in this town, listening to people, than any SEC chairman during my experience here in the Senate.
Obviously I have not always agreed with Chairman Levitt on everything, but I have always found him willing to listen to people, willing to work with people and I think that is a great quality in a person who would be a public servant. So I'm very proud to join you, Mr. Chairman, in supporting this nomination. I also want to thank you for making note of the fact that Arthur will be making history if he serves out this term in terms of having this job longer than anybody else in the history of the country. Maybe it tells you something, Arthur, that no one has ever kept it that long and you may decide not to. But in any case, I've enjoyed working with you in your current position. I look forward to working with you once you've been reconfirmed by the Senate. And I want to thank you for the good job you've done.
SEN. D'AMATO: Thank you, Senator.
Senator Dodd?
SEN. CHRISTOPHER J DODD (D-CT): Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I don't know, maybe we just ought to pack up and go home here with all of these accolades being hurled at you here. But all well deserved as well.
And Mr. Chairman, let me begin to join my colleague and the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Securities in commending you for holding this hearing in such a timely fashion. And so we can move on this re-nomination process. I think there's a lot of reasons for doing that, not the least of which is that if we do this quickly Arthur may not change his mind. And we'll be able to have his services for the remainder of this next term and again there's a long list of things, Mr. Chairman, that I'm grateful for your support on And it's always been on the basis of what's been right, cold, detached analysis and thank you, Mr. Chairman, for scheduling this mark up of a bill that Senator Graham and I have worked on, that you've worked with us and many members of the committee have. And one of the things that Senator Graham and I have felt very strongly about is that without some support from the Securities Exchange Commission, we would not go forward on this.
We need to have a piece of legislation that is going to enjoy the support of our regulators, the chief regulator in this area. And there's been a lot of discussion, a lot of work, tremendous staff work and the people at the SEC under Arthur's leadership have brought us to this point so we thank you for the date but we'll never have the date quite frankly had we not had the leadership at the SEC that would have helped us put together and frame a piece of legislation here that we think deserves our collegiate support as well and that will obviously come later.
Today's not a day to debate a specific piece of legislation but it is an indication of the kind of leadership that Arthur Levitt has provided at the SEC and there are a long list of issues that have come before this committee, our subcommittee particularly, that deserve particular recognition. But I'm going to take just a minute and share with my colleagues here another aspect to Arthur Levitt which I think is very, very important that we try and set a standard I hope will be and those that succeed Arthur Levitt in the years to come. I had the privilege of being in Hamden, Connecticut, with the Chairman of the SEC several months ago at Arthur's suggestion, not mine.
Normally, it's members of Congress that will say to a Cabinet member or a chief regulator, can you come to our state or district; we'd like to have a town meeting, a very appropriate thing to do. But this is something that the SEC initiated under the leadership of Arthur Levitt to go to jurisdictions around the country and invite the small investor and this room was packed this morning in Hamden, Connecticut. I think there were 4 or 500 people that had heard the public notice. There was no specific invitation to come out and have a discussion with the Chairman of the Securities Exchange Commission about how the SEC works, what the rules are, how they apply and it was really a wonderful morning and it wasn't just a speech and I got up and gave a speech of welcome.
The Chairman got up and he was like Oprah Winfrey. I mean he was working the crowd in the middle of the audience. This could have been on national television as a normal interview show. It was a remarkable performance and done to -- the people are still talking about up there and this wasn't the only place where the Chairman did it. I don't know how many other such occasions, I know a number around the country that were done and I think it's a very important thing to do. A lot of times when we ask people in Washington to come to our states or districts to appear, it's sort of a lull sense it. I don't care what Administration it is, well, you know, I'm busy and I really can't be there and I'd like to, can I send someone else, all of the excuses and reluctantly people show up but it's usually some text that they've delivered a 100 other places and they get in and get out and I'm not sure people get much of it.
But what Arthur Levitt did is of course reach out and not just to talk with us and our staffs but to get around the country and again I can say there are a lot of other issues that specifically to come before the SEC that I think you've handled well but I was particularly impressed with the fact that the Chairman of this agency, of this very, very important agency, where you and I, Arthur, have talked so many times about -- if there's one word I think that we share in common in terms of the goal is the word confidence. An ocean of confidence that people in this country have in our markets and our regulators.
The sense that people off shore have when they come and want to be listed on our exchanges is a wonderful degree, a high degree not equal to any place else in the world of confidence that their investment is going to be protected from abuses outside of the normal market fluctuations that everyone anticipates. And you have sustained and I think enhanced that word of confidence by your willingness to get out and see people and talk to people in very candid, clear words and language that I think has helped improve the sense of confidence people have in our markets.
And I have a prepared comments here that I'll put in the record, Mr. Chairman, but of all the things that I've been pleases about in terms of how Arthur Levitt has handled his job, I think his willingness to reach people and to enhance a sense of confidence people have in our market says volumes about why I think this nomination ought to be approved as quickly as we possibly can. And continue the wonderful service that this man has been willing to give to his country and I thank you for it.
SEN. D'AMATO: Thank you very much, Senator. Senator Faircloth.
SEN. LAUCH FAIRCLOTH (R-NC): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for holding this hearing and I just want to say very simply that I think that Arthur Levitt is -- President Clinton's made two superfine appointments, Arthur Levitt and Erskine Bowles and I think the SEC is --
SEN. D'AMATO: And Arthur doesn't even come from your state.
(Laughter.)
SEN. FAIRCLOTH: That helped him a lot.
(Laughter.)
SEN. FAIRCLOTH: But the SEC is one of the best in the Clinton Administration in fact they've made since 1993. He's truly one of the stars of the Administration and I think he's done an excellent job at SEC and particularly as an advocate of protecting the interest of investors. I just strongly support his renomination and urge the committee to move forward quickly with approving him.
SEN. D'AMATO: Thank you very much, Senator. Senator Bryan.
SEN. RICHARD H. BRYAN (D-NV): Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. It's always a pleasure to have you before us, Levitt. You've presided over an extraordinary expansion in the markets in our country and it's an interesting time indeed. We reach a different conclusion on S 12 60 but I must compliment you for your quick response to a letter that my friends and colleagues on the committee sent you on March 24th, our able Chairman and distinguished Chairman of the subcommittee and our equally distinguished ranking member, sent you a letter asking for your views on S 12 60.
That letter was dated March 24th, 1998 and uncharacteristic and mercurial response which is not something that we're used to here in Washington but you responded on the same day, March 24th, 1998, and I must say that I don't generally get those kind of responses when we send it to a federal agency asking for an evaluation and I hope this might be a new standard in terms at the federal level of what kind of responses we might get. So I commend you for your responsiveness and Mr. Chairman, I'll be asking Mr. Levitt some questions about S1260 as we get a chance to go through our questioning stage and again a pleasure to have you before us.
SEN. D'AMATO: Thank you very much, Senator. And Chairman Levitt, before we turn to you for your remarks I had the privilege and the honor of meeting your wonderful family and I'm wondering if you would introduce them before you start with your remarks.
MR. ARTHUR LEVITT: Thank you very much. My wife Marilyn, my daughter Lori, my grandson William, my son-in-law Michael, my grandson Matthew, my son Arthur, his wife Jamie, and my sister Kayla.
SEN. D'AMATO: Thank you very much.
MR. LEVITT: It's difficult for me to respond to those words of warmth and friendship and support which mean so much to me as I -- when an agency that I am so proud of, proud because it has been nonpartisan ever since it was formed in terms of the issues that it deals with and the approach that it has taken to many of the divisive issues that have come before it. Its judgments have been based on what it believes is best for our capital markets and what it believes is best for investors.
SEN. D'AMATO: Mr. Chairman, let me say this. They've advised me that at this point in time, I am to swear you in and so I would ask if you would stand for the purpose and I take it that the acknowledgement of your family was truthful?
(Laughter.)
SEN. DODD: You never embarrass a man by asking someone --
WITNESS SWORN IN.
MR. LEVITT: I am deeply honored to appear before this distinguished committee to seek your support for my continued service at the SEC. I'm very grateful that the esteemed senior Senator from New York, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan for accompanying me here today and introducing me so graciously. I must, again, comment on my wife's presence here, her support and her encouragement and her participation are the foundation of my working life and my family life.
Also joining me today, as you mentioned before are three of my fellow SEC commissioners, Commissioner Johnson, Hunt, Commissioner Unger whose collective wisdom and dedication is a large part of what makes the commission great. Since 1993, it's been my privilege to lead the agency responsible for protecting America's investors and enhancing its capital markets. Much has happened during those years. We've seen an historic market rise and an historic market fall. We've seen the leadership of Congress pass from the Democrats to the Republicans. We've seen budget cuts and a budget surplus. And we've seen Americans in record numbers leave the safety of insured bank accounts for the risks and reward of the markets.
These changes have certainly brought many, many challenges. And yet, I can honestly say that I have enjoyed every single day of my tenure. Indeed, for this capitalist and entrepreneur, service at the SEC has been the greatest adventure and the highest honor of my professional life. I thank you deeply for that. For the better part of five years, we have worked together on behalf of the system of capital formation that continues to be the envy of the world. A system able to include both dealer and auction markets while allowing individual investors to participate on a level playing field with the world's largest and most powerful institutions.
Together, we have debated and discussed issues, proposals and legislation of great consequence for our economy. And we've done so against a background of increasing globalization, a proliferation of complex, important but volatile investment products and the unprecedented growth of technology driven trading system. Together, we have addressed critical and potentially divisive issues such as market structure, circuit breakers, financial modernization, litigation reform, accounting standards and preparing for the millennium.
Always, always the commission has worked closely with this committee and it's staff to strengthen the investor protections that are the foundation of a market place known for it's integrity, trusted for it's transparency and distinguished for it's commitment to protecting investors. Although, we may approach some issues from different perspectives from time to time, I have never doubted for a single moment that our overriding motivation was to protect, nurture, and enhance the system in markets that we have inherited. Having spent nearly 40 years in the private sector, I have made one word the touchstone of my service as a regulator and that word is balance.
The power, vibrancy and entrepreneurial spirit of our nation's markets must not be burdened with redundant, overly costly or superfluous regulation. And yet at the same time, our brokerage firms, self-regulatory organizations, and investment companies must be held to the highest standards of professionalism and integrity. I've worked to maintain a balance between market forces and regulatory guideposts by using consensus when ever possible and rule making and legislation only where absolutely necessary.
If the agency has responded successfully to the dynamic changes of recent years, it's due to the dedication and professionalism of the SEC staff. The reform of our municipal bond markets, the lazing of standards for retail brokers, the record numbers of international companies listing on US exchanges and the major enforcement actions we've completed were only made possible by the dedicated efforts of an incredibly talented and energetic staff. Many of these issues will continue to attract our attention during the months and years ahead. I suspect that market dynamics will call for emphasis on technology, on market structure, and on closer coordination with our international counterparts.
With the market breaking records at almost every turn, with mergers of giant enterprises proliferating, and with record sums of money flowing into mutual funds, our mission is more imperative than ever. Together, we must maintain public trust, together we must balance competing interests that are part of all competitive and growing markets, together we must seek market solutions before rule making, before legislation. You and I have inherited the most liquid, transparent, and dynamic markets in the history of the world. This is an absolutely precious legacy that belongs not to us, but to the American people.
I pledge to you that if you see fit to confirm me, I will continue to do all in my power to honor this heritage. I pledge that I will continue to work closely with Congress, the private sector, and investors, to protect and enhance our capital markets and to find solutions to important issues, no matter how divisive they may be. Most of all, I pledge that I will continue to place the interests of investors above all others and to preserve the trust that makes America's markets the greatest in the world.
Thank you.
SEN. D'AMATO: Well, Mr. Chairman, let me thank you for such a wonderful, a concise and obviously heartfelt presentation to this committee. I had some questions to raise with you, but I think in light of your statement, it would be silly. We know the technological changes that are coming, we know the 2000 year problem that you and others are working to deal with, and you said it here in your speech, you're concerned that the markets will have increased technological forces and pressures and particularly coordinating our activities with our international counterparts that will become an increasing concern.
You were probably going to get into some very vexing areas there. And I think that this committee will be dealing with them in terms of our trading partners and the access that they permit to us and vice versa, and the enforcement to see to it that there is a level playing field abroad, as well as here. All those things we will be wrestling with. I just want to simply say that I believe your presentation has been absolutely marvelous and stirring. Your pledge and your commitment to the little guy, so to speak, to this country as a whole, and to that which preserves and makes it a very special place to be, and gives some vibrance and meaning to the word the capital-free capital system and democracy, because that's all intertwined. If you don't preserve that for all, then we don't meet the great trust placed in us. And I feel tremendously honored that you would agree to continue to serve.
Senator Dodd.
SEN. DODD: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
I certainly echo those sentiments and comments -- (inaudible) -- statements. I'd like to, if I could, Chairman, ask you about the year 2000 issue. Our colleague, Bob Bennett, as you know, has been deeply interested in this, he and I, under the leadership of the chairman of the committee have spent, I don't know how many hearings we've had now, and you've been tremendously helpful on this issue. We hope in fairly short order, to maybe have even a more focused effort on the part of this United States Senate on this issue.

That's obviously a lot in the area of financial services. I just have two quick questions for you in this area. One has to do with what sort of response as a result to your credit, the issuance of legal bulletin, I think number five it was, on the issue of disclosure of what companies were doing. I wonder if you could describe whether these staff bulletins had the desired effect of improving the corporate disclosure, what kind of ongoing review is taking place at the commission to monitor these disclosures, and what further steps would you contemplate taking at the SEC between now and the year 2000, January one 2000 to try and at least to have improve disclosure by public companies.
And secondly, a related question, what the commission is doing with foreign capital markets and market regulators to coordinate our efforts, and to what degree are you concerned and should we be concerned about the readiness of other nations to meet the compliance requirements that are going to be necessary to avoid the obvious problems that have been detailed with the computer glitch in the year 2000.
MR. LEVITT: Senator, you correctly point out the complexity of the year 2000 problem and the consequences of noncompliance by any major company, as far as I'm concerned, are terminal. And I think that ultimately, that's the best protection we have that companies know that you can't put off the year 2000 and I'm satisfied that American companies are aware of that fact.
Now, we have sent an unprecedented number of letters to every brokerage firm and financial advisor in the nation, asking them to advise us on what they were doing, in terms of preparation for the year 2000. The staff legal bulletin, which we put out that you referred to, I believe that we are going to get more disclosure with respect to what companies are doing for the year 2000, and the upcoming filings that will be coming through in the next 30 to 60 days, than we have ever seen before.
We've already seen the major automotive companies have reported how many millions of dollars they are spending to comply, and we've also asked accounting firms to certify to the ability of companies that they audit, to take the preparations in order to prepare themselves for the year 2000.
I far from saying about the ability of international counter- parties to do the same. I've traveled about the world, speaking to the heads of international stock exchanges, urging them to prepare their list of companies for preparations for the year 2000, and the first time I made such a presentation, I was surprised at the wonderment that greeted me by the heads of these exchanges.
Our representations at IASCO, which is the organization representing all securities regulators around the world were somewhat better prepared to carry the message to their companies and their countries, but I am not persuaded that enough is being done on an international basis, and I will continue to work with IASCO, continue to communicate with heads of exchanges around the world, and I suggested before that a US company that by the beginning of next year is not satisfied that their customers are doing what has to be done to prepare for the year 2000, should seriously consider the alternative of not doing further business until they are so prepared.
SEN. DODD: Any foreign --
MR. LEVITT : Yes.
SEN. DODD: -- with whom they're doing business --
MR. LEVITT: Yes.
SEN. DODD: -- sever their relationship.
MR.LEVITT : Yes.
SEN. DODD: Thank you.
SEN. D'AMATO : Senator Gramm.
SEN. PHIL GRAMM (R-TX): Well, Mr. Chairman, first of all, let me thank you for your concern about this area. I think the disclosure requirements on health insurance liability dramatically changed corporate behavior. And really helped spur the revolution we've had in health care reform, while Washington talked, the private sector acted. And the requirement that people disclose their contingency liability on these programs, I think, and no less authority than Alan Greenspan thinks, had a lot to do with their actions. So, to the extent that making people begin to disclose the impact of this problem I think probably is a major step forward.
It's a shame we can't get the people who did all the reprogramming of the computers in the year 1000 to come back and show us how to fix this problem. (Cross talk.)
SEN. GRAMM: -- he didn't know what the hell was wrong, we've known for at least 100 years, the year 2000 was coming. Why we didn't do at least 100 years --
SEN. D'AMATO (?): Have you considered calling Strom?
(Laughter.)
SEN. GRAMM: He'll be worried about it, knowing he'll be here to see it happen.
I don't have any questions, Mr. Chairman; again, I just want to congratulate you on --
SEN. D'AMATO : Thank you Senator.
Senator Bryan.
SEN. RICHARD BRYAN (D-NV): Thank you very much. Chairman, we agreed that the American securities market is the greatest market in the world, and I think in part that's because as my colleague, Dodd referenced, or it's investor confidence. I think also important would be investor remedy in those circumstances in which fraud or other inappropriate conduct occurs, and so I'm going to ask you a couple of questions here in terms of trying to understand your thinking in terms of supporting S1260, which as you know, I have some concerns about.
Let me refresh your recollection. In April of last year, you wrote the President stating, and I quote, 'It's too early to assess with confidence many important effects of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, and therefore it is premature to propose legislative changes.' In a similar vein, in July before the subcommittee, you had this to say, and I quote, 'It will take time for the effects of the Reform Act to become clear. State court remedies traditionally have been an important component of investor protection. Reaction of those remedies based on the limit data or before the states have had a chance to respond to the changes in litigation practice brought about by the reform act would be premature.'
And again, last fall in October, you testified that the commission is conferred. And this testimony was with respect to S1260 the bill before us. And you went on to say that the bill would deprive investors of important protection such as aiding and abetting liability, longer statutes of limitation that are only available under state law. Reaction of state claims involving liability for reckless conduct may also be inappropriate while the status of such claims under federal law is still being considered by the court.

If Congress considers solutions to the problems of securities fraud litigation, the commission believes that great care should be taken to safeguard the benefits of our dual system of federal and state law, which has served investors well for over 60 years. End of quote.
I guess the logical question I have, Mr. Levitt, is you know, what has occurred since last fall, that would change your view on S1260, I'm not a securities lawyer, never been in the field, and maybe it's court decisions, or some appellate court decisions, or even a summary judgement or two. But what has changed in your view?
MR. LEVITT: Senator, I did not establish the timetable for the legislation that appears to be working its way through the Senate and the Congress. Some 34 Senators, I understand, cosponsored this legislation, some 195 Representatives in the House got behind that legislation. There is clearly a groundswell in terms of getting that legislation on the books. I have not lost one bit of ardor for aiding and abetting or extending the statute of limitations, I think both of those are goals that I will continue to work with. But that's not what this bill included.
But this bill did address an issue that I said early on and I continue to say today, deals with a certain level of irrationality. That to have two separate standards is not unlike if you had, in the state of Virginia, two speeding limits, one for 60 miles an hour and one for 40 miles an h our. I think the havoc that would create with drivers is not dissimilar from the kind of disruption created by two separate standards and I have long felt that in some areas a single standard is desirable.
Now you correctly point out the very compellingly important role that the states play in protecting their citizens. And the original reform legislation, as well as this legislation, allows the states, except for class actions, to protect their citizens. And we certainly support that -- support the state's rights to handle the registration of brokers, there on the scene, and they're cops on the beat, and they should do that, and will continue to do that. But with respect to a class action, the dual standards, I believe, are wrong.
Furthermore, the cases that are working their way through the courts, I believe today, that that process may endure for a number of years. And working with this committee, working with the supporters of this bill, we were able to introduce certain protections for something that I cared a great deal about, which you didn't mention, and that was preserving the recklessness standard, which I believe was in partial of the original legislation, and which has been called into question by these court actions, and which the sponsors of this legislation have agreed in terms of legislative language, was intended not to be changed in that original legislation.
So, that with those changes, with that level of support, in terms of legislative language, I am able to support a bill, which I do not believe that's perfect, but which I believe that's a major thrust; it offers investors basic protections, and enables the US capital markets to continue to be the pre-eminent in the world.
SEN. BRYANT: Mr. Levitt, I would agree that my colleagues who support this legislation are among the most skillful and able in the Congress. This train is leaving the station. I understand that, it will become law. And if you believe the recklessness is important to make sure that it is in the Federal Law, and there is a substantial question as you know on the courts today, in fact in the a amicus briefs filed by the FDC, repeatedly you've made the point to your attorneys that if we lost recklessness, it would virtually disavow those protections that are reported to investors.
I'm pleased to see that recklessness, and I haven't seen the language, is going to be reaffirmed as part of the federal standards. But if you feel about the statute of limitations, the a longer statute of limitations on the aiding and bedding liability, which you've testified to previously, and reaffirmed your position now, wouldn't it be prudent to say that you would condition your support for this legislation upon the inclusion of those two as well? Because by preempting state law, there is no aiding and abetting liability, there is no longer statute of limitations available to an investor who has been defrauded.
MR. LEVITT: Only in class action, Senator.
SEN. BRYANT: But as a practical matter, most individuals don't have the wherewithal as you and I understand, Mr. Levitt, to bring senseless litigation to class action, is the only realistic remedy for most investors. And if you believe, as you've indicated that you do, that aiding and abetting is an important part of investment protection, and a longer statute. Why not insist that that be included on the legislation as well, since we're going to be preempting the state law which is the only protection that's currently available.
MR. LEVITT: Senator, I'm an incrementalist, and I believe that the affirmations with respect to the recklessness standard were by far and away the most compelling concern that I had about this legislation. I will not abandon for one single moment my quest for reasserting, and extended statute of limitations, and reintroducing aiding and abetting, but I felt that what we got in terms of recklessness was clearly a constructive step in the right direction.
SEN. BRYANT: Mr. Levitt, I haven't seen the language, and Mr. Chairman, I'm not going to abuse my time, but I've not seen the language. But I am told that we're not talking about statutory language, we're only talking about legislative history.
I did, once upon a time, practice ever so little bit of law, not at the securities level, and legislative history is as one Vice President said about the vice presidency, not worth a warm bucket of spit. He used more descriptive language to describe the fluid, but it's been cleaned up over the years, to the degree of spit. But I mean if we believe that recklessness is an important thing, shouldn't we have legislative language?
MR. LEVITT: Would I prefer legislative language? Yes, I would. We're not talking about members of the Senate creating legislative language for a bill that was crafted 25 years ago, we're talking about the sponsors of legislation that sponsor the very same kind of legislation, barely two years ago, who are qualifying what was in a bill that they crafted. So, I think the legislative language in this instance has a good deal more force than it might have in any other circumstance.
SEN. BRYANT: Well, I appreciate that, but let me say I'm somewhat skeptical, if that will have much impact upon the court. And finally, I would just make the point that last week, and I think you were quite that candid, you know you pointed out that one out of every three American households now invest in the securities market. That's a great tribute to the confidence that the Americans have in the market. Indicate that the market volume and activities are greater than ever, and that fraud is growing at an alarming rate, and then you pointed to fraudulent offerings, and securities and market manipulation, insider trading.
I guess where we would disagree, Mr. Levitt, is I think we've stripped from investors vital protection. That's my own view, not shared certainly by a majority of this committee, or of my colleagues in the Senate, that the investors are going to be the big losers as a result of the preemption of the state remedies, particularly when we have open, and in my view, the recklessness statute of limitations of aiding and abetting provisions. Mr. Chairman, I thank you for indulging me beyond my time. Next hearing I'll take less.
SEN. D'AMATO: I would anticipate at the next hearing, with respect to this legislation, you'll take more time --
(Laughter.)

-- and I think that's important, and that's good. I'd be remiss if I didn't touch on two important factors. Let me just simply say, and I don't think this is the time to debate what will be thoroughly debated here, and probably on the floor of the Senate with respect to any proposed reform. I think that Chairman Levitt very incorrectly pointed out that given, if there's any question with respect to the law that exists now, and that we are building on, we will be stating quite clearly what the legislative intent is both within the committee, and on the Senate floor, and that that will I think very clearly convey our message without getting into further misinterpretation. What do you really mean by spelling this out? I think we will be spelling this out very clearly.
And secondly, it is that in this, as I understand it, we in no way impede the state's attorney generals from undertaking the various acts that where there is the fraudulent conduct, that they in no way are circumscribed, first the commission from undertaking it's own actions, in no way. But as it relates to the very small, and sometimes very painful to the business community procedures whereby there are frivolous class action suits, and that's what this committee is looking to discourage, that small but very costly percentage of actions that fall within this very narrow aspect, where very little is done to protect the individuals shareholders here, either him or herself.
And that we in no way, in no way, I have resisted calls for this business of loser pays, we've had colleagues who approach us, who would really just literally just strip away the ability of those who are aggrieved to be able to bring actions. And indeed where there is the kind of willful disregard, and where there is outright afford, I certainly, I think that even in those cases we should look to exact the most from the people that bring this about. And I don't think this legislation I certainly know it's not the intent, but in anyway, would deprive the shareholders of the ability to be protected by the various state regulatory agencies.
Senator Dodd.
SEN. DODD: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I have had -- certainly I don't want to get into a debate on the bill that Senator Gramm, and Senator Domenici and I, and I should point out some 33 other members of the Senate, Democrats and Republicans that do, and I have the highest of regards to my colleagues from Nevada, and with those we have engaged in lengthy debate and discussion of previous legislation, and I get a feeling I am Yogi Berra here, and talking about deja vu all over again as we revisit the issue.
But just a couple of points I'd like to make in respect for rebuttal, my colleague from Nevada. We never addressed the issue in the '95 act of recklessness, not in the bill, we were silent on the issue of recklessness. The courts have looked to legislative history on the definition of recklessness, and we thought it was appropriate in light of the confusion in that to include in legislative history, and the proposal that will come before this committee at the end of April, our interpretation of that. But there was nothing in the bill in '95 that addressed the issue, so the legislator that called the legislative history is really in compliance with what the courts have sought in the previous decisions.
In regard to underlying rational to this, what motivates this member from Connecticut on this legislation, is the same motivations my colleague from Nevada has, and that is investors protection. It is knowledge well known to most people in this country that we have seen a lot of these striped suits, in fact there's a rather small bar in the country that is talked about. It's the ideal practice, it's a practice without clients, where you literally go and a these mammoth suits. Ninety nine point seven percent of them are settled because the cost of litigating is so far in excess sometimes that just paying of damages that it's a sense of almost of highway robbery to see the investors in these companies pay the price. It was the very investor that my colleague from Nevada speaks of, I speak of as well.
As the Chairman of the SEC has pointed out, to have dual standards here; we do nothing to deprive the state from proceeding with issues that are located solely in a single jurisdiction, that's up to the states, and the commissioners in those states. We're talking about standards set here for interstate issuance. In there, there is a need, I think for some single standards here. Quite clearly there are jurisdictions that become the ideal forum to bring lawsuits. It's no secret where they are, in the country everyone knows they exist, if you can get into them, then you've got a jurisdiction which has been historically inclined to support plaintiffs in these striped suits, so we're trying to avoid that.
But maybe more importantly than all of that is one of these we've tried to do, in the '95 act, was to provide as much information for potential investors as possible, and that was the controversial section dealing say with safe harbor. We want investors, potential investors to know as much as they possibly can about the companies in which they are about to make investments, and what we're watching here, is they're reluctance to use that safe harbor provisions, and if that's the case, then we're defeating the very purpose of the '95 act or one of the major purposes in the legislation.
So, while I would chance to debate this more fully on the 29th of April, and I presume on the floor as well, but for many of us here, we think this is a timely piece of legislation, it's necessary, we're about to enter a new millennium, in which it's going to be critically important that we avoid the kind of frivolous lawsuits that we've seen far, far too often on the behalf of a handful of people who have made it a business, it used to be a practice, now it's become a business where it's simply filing computer generated complaints have generated millions, and millions of dollars from companies unwilling to go through the costly process of litigating these issues. We want to put a stop to that. We think it's wrong, and it's harmful. Now hopefully this legislation will assist in this process.
SEN. D'AMATO: Senator, I am reluctant to cut any member off, and I'm not going to do it at this point, but I'm going to ask that we limit our comments --
SEN. DODD: And I will, and I -- and at the Chairman's request, I would agree with my colleagues that this is not the time to debate it. Just simply to make a point. We all agree on the importance of recklessness -- reckless scandals. My colleagues from Connecticut has said that, the Chairman has said that, no intend apparently in the '95 act.
If we all agree that it's that important, and because it is in question before the court, it seems to me that there is a compelling argument to include that in the legislative plan, that's the only point that I made, because if we lose that reckless standard, it's not just in the class action, but Chairman, you all have precluded the commission has precluded, and so what's at risk here is considerably just more than our effort to curb as Mr. Shelby points out, what you believe to be a frivolous lawsuits, have no (fight ?) with the frivolous lawsuit, but the Commissioner was included as well, and that was the only thing I wanted to say.
SEN. D'AMATO: Thank you, Senator.
Senator Faircloth.
SEN. FAIRCLOTH: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Chairman Levitt, as you know I have some concerns about the Financial Accounting Standards Board, but I won't try the case on them here today. I'll get with you sometime in the next few weeks and we'll sit down and talk about where the differences on them.
MR. LEVITT: Thank you, Senator.
SEN. FAIRCLOTH: Mr. Chairman, one quick question. Where do we stand with the rules about de-listing from the New York Stock Exchange? I had some concerns that too easy to de-list might be troublesome for small investors. Is it valid what I'm saying, any basis to it?
MR. LEVITT: Well the New York Stock Exchange has filed with the Commission a proposal to make the de-listing process somewhat easier and somewhat more comparable to those of some of the other exchanges. And we're in a period of collecting public comment on that proposal and evaluating that comment before we draw any conclusions.
This is a divisive issue because of the intense competition between exchanges and we are going to carefully consider the comments to the proposal and I would expect that within the next 30 days you probably will have a response on that.
SEN. FAIRCLOTH: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
SEN. D'AMATO: Thank you very much, Senator.
Senator Reed.
SEN. REED: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I believe Senator Bryan's raised some very important questions about the Recklessness Standard and I want to see if I can figure out where we are at the moment. We all would regret the demise, I believe in Recklessness Standard. It seems that your position is based upon the notion that we're incorporating in legislative history appropriate language, which states, or restates again the Reckless Standard. It seems though that was done back in 1995, that in fact the legislative history was done so. In fact, Chairman D'Amato's letter, along with Senator Gramm and Senator Dodd said we intend to restate these facts about the '95 act. By my reckoning, 11 out of 27 District Courts have rejected legislative history.
MR. LEVITT: That's correct.
SEN. REED: Which leaves us in a sort of awkward position and I'm not a, you know, again, a constitutional law scholar but it seems to me that the Supreme Court is less and less willing to accept legislative history in lieu of statutory language and so I think we're, again, in an awkward position and it seems to me that we're sort of betting on the same horse that lost 11 out of 27 races this time out. So did you want to comment on that?
MR. LEVITT: Senator, I believe that this circumstance, where the sponsors of this legislation were also sponsors of the prior legislation that was enacted barely two years ago, is very different and that the legislative history embraced by, at this point, would have much greater meaning than legislative history which characteristically may comment on something that occurred some years before that.

Again, I would say would I prefer to see the Recklessness Standard certified? Yes, I would. Is this bill a perfect bill? No, it isn't. But as the result of consultation and discussions that we've had on a variety of aspects of this bill, the areas that concern me the most, namely the Recklessness Standard, was given something that it didn't have when the bill was first introduced. And because of that, and because of my overall feeling that to have dual standards in this fashion is burdensome on the process of raising capital and is severely wrong, I can support the legislation in its present form.
SEN. REED: Just a follow question on it.
MR. LEVITT: Okay.
SEN. REED: I assume that that opinion's not unanimous of the Commission, isn't that correct?
MR. LEVITT: That's correct.
SEN. REED: With regard to Senator Bryan's point with the overall effect, if the legislative history is disregarded by the Courts, would that in effect mean that Reckless Standards loss for every authority SEC, states attorney generals and individual investors?
MR. LEVITT: I think the loss of the Recklessness Standard in the Courts would be a very, very serious setback for the Commission and I would be up here pounding the halls of Congress forgoing Senator D'Amato, Senator Gramm, Senator Bennett and yourself, to introduce legislation to codify the Recklessness Standard.
SEN. REED: Would you see any major systemic dangers if this Reckless Standard was eliminated? I know the cases basically meant there would be aggrieved small, particularly small shareholders would be aggrieved because they couldn't get access to a class action suit with the Reckless Standard, but would you be fearful that will just have a systemic effect or loss of skills within a systemic effect?
MR. LEVITT: I'm not sure what you mean by systemic.
SEN. REED: Well, one that will create a culture in which a lot of shop operators, who now are in check because of the Reckless Standard, would feel a little more free to wheel and deal and again, beyond the individual.
MR. LEVITT: I think, unquestionably, the loss of the Recklessness Standard would do great damage to the Commission's ability to protect investors.
SEN. REED: Let me just change the topic. Turning now to the Small Order Execution System. It originally was created to allow the small traders access and apparently a lot of larger traders are participating. In fact, I'm told that GAO is working on a study of the SOES, and a preliminary finding says that 98 percent of the people using the system are not small investors at all. And there's potential here for abuse and I wonder what the Commission is doing, along with NASD to look into the operation of small orders, sir?
MR. LEVITT: The NASD has considered various comments about the Small Order Execution System which was first implemented in 1988, after the market decline which caused such a disruption in terms of the ability of small investors to access their dealers and their brokers. The recommendation of the NASD to replace the Small Order Execution System is about to be made to the Commission. And we're going to consider it very shortly in response to comments that have been made about various aspects of the Small Order Execution System that's in place at the present time.
SEN. REED: Thank you. Let me once again say that you've discharged your duties with great distinction and we're pleased with your performance.
MR. LEVITT: Thank you, sir.
SEN. REED: Thank you, sir.
SEN. D'AMATO: Thank you, Senator Reed.
Senator Bennett.
SEN. ROBERT F BENNETT (R-UT): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I couldn't let Chairman Levitt come before the committee without showing up and expressing my admiration for him. I support for his reappointment. I've always said that I think he's one of the better choices present. We ought to hang onto him for as long as he's willing to put up with, do public service.
Mr. Chairman, I do have one issue that I'd like to raise with you, taking advantage with respect to SEC rulings on closed-end funds. There is a new report to try to get closed-end funds positioned in such a way that they can become open-end funds relatively easily. And there are those that are saying that would be a form of predatory activity on the part of people looking for an asset bargain; move in on a closed-end fund that then sell for less than asset value, take it over, make it open-end, cash their chips and move on, having destroyed the investment vehicle for the previous owners. My only request to you, I'm not saying that's exactly what would happen, although that's how it's been represented to me, would be that you would consider this subject at the full Commission instead of leaving it handled by the staff.
MR. LEVITT: I make that commitment to you, Senator. We will consider it at the full Commission.
SEN. BENNETT: I would appreciate you doing that. I have some other questions I would submit in writing, but I wanted to raise that one with you. The Chairman has told us to keep it short, so I will respond to the Chairman, but I do want to very vigorously have it on the record how much I support this.
MR. LEVITT: Thank you very much.
SEN. D'AMATO: Thank you very much, Senator.
Senator Shelby.
SEN. RICHARD SHELBY (R-AL): Chairman, I am glad you didn't keep it too short. Otherwise I would have missed seeing Chairman Levitt and I appreciate this. I have a written statement I'd like to be made part of the record and I have several questions dealing with FASB rules, but I'll submit those for the record. I think -- Mr. Chairman. You've brought a lot of leadership to the SEC. I believe you'll continue that. You've got a good reputation; I'm here to support you.
MR. LEVITT: Thank you very much, Senator.
SEN. D'AMATO: Senator Shelby, let me thank you for your being here and for the brevity of your remarks, but yet the great strength of your support, which I think is very obvious to the Chairman. I think it should be obvious to him and hopefully, more particularly, to his family, the great esteem in which we hold the Chairman. Because I know that he is totally committed to what he says and he is making just a great sacrifice and a great contribution to this country. We are privileged to have someone like Arthur Levitt lead us.
Let me say that it is my intent to mark up this nomination, to vote it out for approval. The earliest they tell me we can do this would be at our next public hearing. We're going to have one next Thursday, April 2nd, and that's a credit union hearing, but I intend to simultaneously call for the vote on Chairman Levitt, as I anticipated. I anticipate it will be unanimous support and hopefully we can take it to the floor, maybe even possibly get a waiver there and get it done before we adjourn on Easter recess.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We stand in recess.
MR. LEVITT: Thank you very much.
