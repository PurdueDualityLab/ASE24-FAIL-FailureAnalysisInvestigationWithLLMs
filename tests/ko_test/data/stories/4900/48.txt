SPECIAL REPORT
Who is managing care? Patients seeking treatment think they too often face increased hassles and hurdles in a system that tries to control costs.

Roger and Sheila Hayes do their health care by the book.
When the Byron, Ga., couple need medical services, they consult a worn handbook she received when she signed up for her health care plan, offered by her employer, the Paper Factory of Wisconsin, a national chain.
Carefully, they thumb through the book to make sure the pediatrician, pharmacist or hospital they intend to use are listed in their managed care plan's network of medical professionals --- and are approved for providing services.
Like most Georgians, the Hayeses can no longer ignore the rapid changes taking place in the state's health care marketplace. One in two Georgians now participate in managed care plans, which were hardly visible a decade ago.
At one time the Peach County couple could see any doctor any time, but now they need to get approval before going to a hospital or getting a lab test. Once their insurance benefits guides collected dust in a family file, but now the Hayeses read the fine print and pay attention to company meetings outlining changes in their benefits.
'Everything gets checked out with the book; every place we go, we take the book,' said Roger Hayes, 39, a safety and health manager for the federal Defense Logistics Agency at Robins Air Force Base, south of Macon.
Managed care --- a form of health insurance in which costs are controlled by limiting patients' access to treatment --- has swept through the state's urban areas and has settled in rural Georgia as well.
Its push through the state is causing deep concerns among residents, who struggle with confusion and, as consumer advocates put it, 'the hassle factor' of getting treatment. In fact, some say the worst fears of the opponents of the 1994 Clinton health plan have come true in the free market: restricted choice, red tape, penny-pinching and questions about care.
Patients have also discovered a dearth of oversight as the industry drives forward. Watchdog groups, including the media, howl at outrageous examples of cheapness and callousness, but haven't yet ignited national reform. Elected officials try to pass legislation that addresses specific problems, but so far, no sweeping public policy has been developed.
And managed care is not a panacea for the system. Although some problems have been at least temporarily solved --- skyrocketing medical costs have been reined in over the past few years --- others continue to gnaw at the industry. The uninsured, for example, are largely ignored, and their medical bills remain a burden for everyone, from hospitals to taxpayers.
Yet as long as managed care continues to provide health care benefits at a reasonable cost, it appears here to stay.
'We're all going to have to get used to new marching orders,' said Uwe Reinhardt, a Princeton University health economist. 'Americans were the world's most spoiled children --- we could see any doctor we liked, get any treatment we wanted, and no one worried about the bills.
'But the system has changed, and it's changed for good.' Marching into Georgia Managed care is not a new concept. The first such plan in the country started in the Mojave Desert during the Great Depression, when workers on the Los Angeles aqueduct project agreed to pay 5 cents a day for medical care. That became the seeds of Kaiser Permanente, the nation's oldest health maintenance organization.
In Atlanta, the first HMOs popped up in the 1980s and ran into formidable snags.
'There was immediate resistance by physicians and other providers,'' says B.J. Bennett of the Georgia Business Forum on Health, a coalition of about 100 employers. In addition, employers were reluctant to eliminate choice for workers.
But that changed in the late '80s and early '90s, when corporate medical costs soared and businesses struggled to survive a recession. After being walloped by 10 percent to 20 percent annual increases in health care costs, companies summoned managed care plans to stop the bleeding. The tactic paid off: In the past three years, annual increases in national health insurance costs have averaged no more than 3 percent.

But there were other results.
Physicians began to realize their survival depended on managed care contracts. An American Medical Association survey found, for example, that 92.3 percent of physicians had such contracts last year, up from 88.1 percent in 1996. Last year, doctors also reported that on average, 44 percent of their income came from managed care, up from 38 percent in 1996.
At the same time, doctors have flirted with the idea of unionizing to protect their decision-making power in managed care.
Hospitals saw their revenue tumble as managed care pushed patients toward procedures that could be done quickly and outside of traditional medical settings. In many cases, hospitals that were longtime rivals united in alliances and mergers to slash expenses. In Atlanta, new systems such as 13-hospital Promina, along with Columbia/HCA Healthcare and Emory Healthcare, marketed their services as single entities to insurers and employers.
For patients, managed care changed their lives in three new ways: It started limiting their choices of treatment to a network of handpicked providers of health care. It punished them if they chose to go outside a network by making them pay more or all of the bill.
And finally, managed care did what the name implies: It started managing patients' care, offering case workers and a wide range of preventive services designed to keep people well. The bad and the ugly But as managed care drives deeper into the state, its good features are often eclipsed by consumer concerns about doctor-switching, intrusive questions and denial of care.
Joseph Marbury, 48, of Kennesaw, said his family has gone through almost a dozen doctors since they started participating in managed care plans about seven years ago.
And the Hayeses --- generally pleased with their plan, Employers Health Care --- also ran into problems when Sheila, 38, started experiencing headaches several years ago.
Although their family doctor recommended she see a neurologist, the plan informed them there weren't any approved neurologists in their plan. They decided to pay out of pocket hundreds of dollars so she could see one anyway. The neurologist was able to solve the problem --- an abundance of spinal fluid --- and prescribe medication to ease the pain.
'I think the scary part there is that we're not rich; we're just hard-working, middle-class folks,' said Roger Hayes. 'So we had to debate whether to do this or not. And we decided to go forward. But I know a lot of people who just wouldn't have bothered to go on. They would have just passed on getting help.'

Sometimes, the managed care networks have some incongruous omissions.
'We have patients living across the street from our hospital who can't use it because it's not in their managed care network,' said Skip Wise of Mountainside Medical Center in Jasper. Instead, patients drive dozens of miles to a suburban Atlanta hospital, he said.
And glitches persist. More than 20,000 Aetna U.S. Healthcare customers in Georgia, for example, were mistakenly dropped from the HMO's rolls in January. It resulted in patients having problems verifying coverage when they visited doctors, hospitals and pharmacists.
Even those who like managed care find its fixation on finances somewhat disconcerting.
'I think the biggest shock for me happened after I tore up my knee and needed care,' said Roger Hayes, who required surgery after falling from a deer stand about six weeks ago. 'When I called the (doctor's) office, the first question they asked was what kind of insurance I had --- not how badly I was hurt.'
In a new poll of Georgians conducted for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, more than half surveyed said the health care system needs improvement and another 20 percent believed it needs a complete overhaul.
And although HMOs commonly trot out statistics of 90 percent satisfaction rates, a study conducted by the National Committee for Quality Assurance found 56.2 percent of the plans' members indicated they were completely or very satisfied with their managed care companies.
'I think if we were really managing care, there would be less resistance,' said Mark Johnson, 46, patient advocate for the Shepherd Center, an Atlanta rehabilitative facility. 'But all we're really doing is managing costs. And worst of all, those extra savings are not going back to make things better for patients. They're just being turned into profit.' Seeing the advantages Yet some patients are finding advantages to managed care. Although 34 percent of Georgians surveyed in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll said they were less satisfied with medicine compared with five years ago, 41 percent said they were happier with their health care.
'I can't say it's been a bad deal for us,' said Roger Hayes. 'We've had a couple of problems, but they certainly haven't outweighed the good.'
The Hayeses are in a less-restrictive form of managed care, called a preferred provider organization. In a PPO, patients can go outside a network to see a family doctor or specialist and pay slightly more for the privilege.
Anyone in a managed care plan typically can get free immunizations for their children. Diabetics now have access to syringes and other supplies they used to buy out of pocket. Asthmatics are often assigned a case worker who helps monitor their disease and adjust medication accordingly. Prescriptions, often a great variable in traditional indemnity insurance, are capped at $ 5 to $ 10, and if a patient chooses to pick a generic brand, he or she often saves even more. Doctor visits are usually $ 10 or $ 20 a pop. And that's even if you see a specialist.
Roger Hayes is now seeing a rehabilitative therapist three times a week for his knee problems. He's paying $ 30 a week for the care. 'How can I complain about that?' he said.
And experts point out there was no measurement of quality under the old fee-for-service system.
'Everyone walks around and says, 'Oh, I got the best care under my old insurance.' Really? How do you know? I don't know if I was getting the best care and I doubt whether anybody --- short of Bill and Hillary --- could be absolutely positive they were getting great care,' said Michael Donio of the People's Medical Society, an Allentown, Pa., health care consumer group. 'We need to not confuse access with quality.' Role for watchdog? Still, the HMO horror story has become a staple in some national media. Every anecdote of managed care mistreatment creates ripples of mistrust. And in some cases, the reaction has led politicians to pursue a hodgepodge of solutions. The medical industry points to the mandatory 48-hour maternity stay after childbirth as just one example of this kind of knee-jerk reaction, especially since many obstetricians believe one day for some mothers is safe and acceptable.
And current proposals in the state's General Assembly would set coverage guidelines for conditions such as diabetes and osteoporosis, and for hospital stays after a mastectomy.
'Up to this point, all we've gotten is a bunch of body-part legislation,' said Beverly Tyler of Georgia Health Decisions, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research group. 'There really has not been a lot of thought behind creating a foundation of patient protections as we move into the managed care arena.' The business community and HMOs decry these bills as mandates, which they say will add to the cost of care --- and lead to more workers becoming uninsured.
'Whether we like it or not, cost is the big kicker,' says Bert Fridlin of the National Federation of Independent Business.
And Kelley Atkinson of United HealthCare of Georgia, a leading HMO locally, sees the demonization of managed care being similar to the portrayal of drug and insurance companies as villains during the 1994 hearings on the Clinton health care proposal.
But many consumer advocates and politicians don't believe managed care should be left to its own devices --- especially as health plans start dealing with increasing numbers of aging baby boomers and the poor. 'Where people find there are problems (with managed care) is with the chronic diseases, the irritating problems that require a specialist,'' said Georgia State University economist Bill Custer. 'Back pain, for example. If consumers are going to be dissatisfied with their plan, it's going to be over something like this.''
And Jane Baumgarten, a national board member with the American Association of Retired Persons, said the jury's still out on how managed care will deal with the elderly, people with disabilities and the poor.
To prepare, many politicians are striving to set up protections for people who can't fend for themselves. Nationally, both President Clinton and U.S. Rep. Charlie Norwood (R-Ga.) talk about the need for patient rights.
'We've got more public policy on the health care of animals and birds than we've got for people,' Norwood said in a recent interview. 'There's something fundamentally wrong with that.' Changes are likely No matter what happens, managed care is not likely go away. But, health experts say, it's also likely managed care may evolve into something new in the years ahead. As patients find their voice in the debate between costs and rights, the government and the free market will find a better balance.
'A good capitalist will eventually find a way to make the customers happy,' said Reinhardt. 'And that is what is going to happen in health care. The guy who can serve you with kindness and respect and also turn a profit, is going to win. That's why McDonald's is so rich.'
Already, some health plans are experimenting with 'open access' HMOs, which allow patients to go to any physician in its network, instead of having to see a ''gatekeeper'' doctor first.
'Managed care now is not what we'll see 10 years from now,' said David Lawrence, chief executive of Kaiser Permanente.
In Georgia, managed care has become dominant in the metro areas of Atlanta, Augusta, Macon, Savannah and Columbus. And preferred provider organizations have sprouted throughout rural Georgia. New HMO growth will occur along I-75 north of Atlanta, predicts Brent Layton of consulting firm Layton & Associates.
But experts say the future shape of managed care --- and its flexibility --- could be hampered by an alarming spurt in health care costs.
In two recent surveys of employers, 1998 costs were expected to increase between 4 percent and 7 percent.
The growth, outlined in a survey conducted by William M. Mercer, a benefits consulting firm, is due to three key factors: HMOs taking serious hits in their 1997 profits, which will most likely result in premium rate boosts this year. Only one Georgia HMO made money last year, said Kevin Curtin of the Georgia Association of HMOs. New state and federal laws that outline minimum standards of care, such as two-day minimum stays for mothers in hospitals after childbirth. Hospitals and doctors organizing and consolidating, in order to gain more bargaining clout with managed care plans. And that means the flexibility that employers and managed care plans have tried to give patients could abruptly end. Already, for example, Aetna has announced it no longer will offer advanced fertility treatment as part of its standard coverage after April 1. Its 1996 acquisition, U.S. Healthcare, had paid for the procedures.
Whatever their options and needs, Georgians must grow attuned to the intricacies of their insurance.
'I think the one thing I've learned is that you've got to become knowledgeable about your own health care,' said Marbury, a consultant. 'That you've got to be a good consumer and fend for yourself --- because no one else will.' COMING MONDAY IN LIVING Part 2: Georgians who dispute decisions by managed care providers often find few allies.
