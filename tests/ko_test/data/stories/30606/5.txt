Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canada's second-largest bank by assets, said a software glitch is preventing branches in Ontario and British Columbia from updating client bank-account balances. The lender might repair the problem today, said Jeff Keay, a spokesperson at the Toronto-based bank. Clients can still make transactions in the branches. The problem doesn't affect any of Toronto-Dominion's Internet or telephone banking operations, Keay said.
