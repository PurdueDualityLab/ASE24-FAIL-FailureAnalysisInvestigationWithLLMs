Toronto-Dominion Bank suffered yet another computer glitch yesterday, this time preventing some of its customers in Ontario and British Columbia from receiving updated account balances.
The breakdown, which affected face-to-face bank teller transactions, is the second network problem the bank has suffered in less than a month and comes on the heels of a string of software and technical problems at Canada's major banks this summer.
Jeff Keay, a TD spokesman, said the "software application problem" was discovered at about 8 a.m. yesterday. The glitch did not impact telephone, online or automated bank systems, he said.
"The disconnect is between the teller platform and the mainframe, for lack of a better term," said Mr. Keay.
"All the information is safe, but its just kind of queued up waiting for us to re-establish the connection."
Mr. Keay said the bank expected to have the problem fixed by late yesterday. He could not say how many customers were affected by the interruption.
"It wasn't as serious as it could have been, given the fact that the ABM network wasn't affected, and that most people do their transactions at ABMs."
TD suffered another malfunction to its system in late July. The temporary glitch, which a bank spokeswoman said was caused by an unexpected increase in system capacity, rendered its automated tellers and online banking services inoperable for about three hours.
Other banks and financial institutions that have suffered from software or technical problems this summer include Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, ING Direct and Royal Bank of Canada.
In early June, RBC customers went for almost a week without reliable account balances after an error related to a routine software upgrade. The glitch delayed the processing of millions of retail, corporate and public client transactions. RBC has yet to disclose the cost of the foul-up, but has said it is not "material" to its business.
