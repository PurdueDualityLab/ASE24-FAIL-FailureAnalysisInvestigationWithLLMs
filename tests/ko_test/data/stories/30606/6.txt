Problem blocks some account updates
A software problem yesterday prevented Toronto-Dominion Bank branches in Ontario and British Columbia from updating customer bank account balances for most of the day.
Spokesman Jeff Keay described it as a ''flow problem'' and said while transactions were being processed as usual, they weren't reflected in client bank balances.
TD is Canada's second-largest bank by assets, and the glitch affected about 500 branches -- just less than half of all TD branches in Canada -- as well as telephone banking operations.
The problem was first noticed at 8 a.m. and resolved by 3:15 yesterday afternoon. It did not affect any of the bank's Internet banking operations or automatic banking machines.
TD (TSX) rose $1.38 to $46.
