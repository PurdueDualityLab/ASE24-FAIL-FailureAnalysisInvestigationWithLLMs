A busy first day for new E-ZPass operator

WOODBRIDGE, N.J. (AP) - Steven Dee, a 35-year-old account executive who lives in Robbinsville, is like many of the state's 1.3 million E-ZPass users. He's never had a problem with the electronic toll system.
"Obviously, I know people who have, and obviously, I've read about it in the paper," said Dee, who had just pulled off the New Jersey Turnpike into the Thomas A. Edison rest area.
But many people have been affected by E-ZPass' widely publicized glitches, which contributed to the state's firing of the system's bankrupt operator, WorldCom. A new company, ACS Local Government Solutions, opened its customer service center Tuesday.
E-ZPass users had not been able to makes inquiries since March 14, when WorldCom, which handled violation-related inquiries, and JP Morgan Chase, which subcontracted with the company to handle account-related inquiries, stopped taking calls.
So, as anticipated, pent-up demand for customer service flooded ACS' 300 customer service representatives Tuesday with many more calls than the 11,000 received on average each day, officials said.
Joe Orlando, a spokesman for the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, which oversees ACS' operation of the E-ZPass system, said the Newark center got about 25,000 calls on its first day. About 13,000 people called Wednesday, Orlando said.
One improvement in customer service touted by transportation officials and ACS is that E-ZPass users can now ask about their balance or a false violation by calling the same toll-free number, 1-888-288-6865.
Orlando said the high volume of calls Tuesday meant ACS sometimes failed to meet its 2-minute standard for maximum hold time.
"I'm not going to lie to you," Orlando said. "It might have been three, three or four, but at most times it was below the two minutes."
There also was an opening-day glitch with the phone lines. A problem installing the lines limited the system to receiving 96 calls at once Tuesday morning, rather than the intended 225, said Anna Farneski, a Department of Transportation spokeswoman. The problem resulted in a busy signal for many callers, but it was fixed by 11 a.m., Farneski said.
About 700 calls to the center Tuesday involved E-ZPass users who, upon driving through an electronic toll lane, saw the message, "Go. Tag not read," Orlando said. He said those callers were mailed new tags.
Several dozen tags belonging to motorists who drove into the Newark customer service center on McCarter Highway were tested on the spot and, when found defective, also were replaced.
Back at the Edison rest area, Stephen Dee, the commuting account executive, said ACS' improved service measures did not mean much to him yet, since he hasn't had a problem.
"I say that now," Dee said. "But now you'll jinx me and I'll have a problem."
Stephen Carrellas, New Jersey Coordinator for the American Motorists Association, said ACS will have to prove itself every day.
"Bottom line is, time will tell in terms of false violations being generated and wait time and hold time of calls," Carrellas said.
New Jersey is in line with other creditors in federal Bankruptcy Court seeking to recoup some of the money it paid WorldCom under a $403 million E-ZPass contract. The ACS contract is worth $450 million over 10 years.
