Drivers using E-ZPass on the state's toll roads won't see that vague "Go" message at the toll plazas anymore. It was replaced Tuesday by messages the state hopes will be more user-friendly and precise.
Before, drivers would get a confusing "Go" message if they weren't paid up - or if there was some other problem. Now, they will get more information. For example, drivers with possible transponder problems will see "Go. Tag not read," on entrance lanes to the New Jersey Turnpike. On the exit lanes, those drivers will see "Go. Toll unpaid." And that's the same thing drivers will see on the Garden State Parkway.
Drivers who are paid up will still see "Go EZ Pass" and "EZ Pass paid" messages.
Though drivers seemed to adapt to the new signs Tuesday, not everything was glitch-free - the first day the state's new contractor took control of the beleaguered E-ZPass system.
An updated telephone system, designed to give drivers faster information about their accounts, frustrated some people who could not get through on the hot line, (888) AUTO-TOLL. Some motorists encountered busy signals or other problems when they tried to call the number.
Frank and Marilyn Racioppi of Saddle Brook were among them. They drove on the Garden State Parkway on Monday, and encountered a "Go" message in the toll lane, which meant something was wrong with either the equipment or their transponder.
Frank Racioppi said he tried about seven or eight times to get through to the toll-free E-ZPass number on Tuesday to find out what was wrong.
"Most of the time it would ring and then it would cut me off," Racioppi said. He said it took him about 45 minutes to get through - a stark contrast to the 25 seconds it's now supposed to take.
"We may have a faulty transponder, but prior to this we've had no problems," Marilyn Racioppi said. "I realize it's the first day, but with all the talk, you'd think the day they are initiating the change it would work perfectly."
New Jersey Turnpike Authority spokesman Joseph Orlando acknowledged Tuesday that there were some phone line problems into the new E-ZPass customer service center between 7 and 11 a.m., but said they were quickly resolved when the state learned of the situation. The new center, in Newark, is one of several steps taken to reform the system by the state and its new E-ZPass contractor, ACS State and Local Solutions.
"AT&T installed some lines into the building and there were problems with switch installation," Orlando said. "It was fixed within half an hour. We know there was a problem and we apologize for that, but we really can't accept responsibility because we're at the mercy of the people who install the technology."
Orlando said that despite the early difficulties, the center handled 25,000 calls, far more than the previous system could handle. He also said that because of the new toll plaza messages, 47 people brought faulty tags to the center by 2 p.m. to get free replacements. And 600 of the 25,000 calls were from drivers getting the new messages.
-'Go' didn't say anything," Orlando said. "It didn't let people know there was a problem."
Drivers who encounter the messages should call the customer service center, officials said.
The state hired ACS in December in a $450 million deal to reform the system, which had been plagued by numerous equipment malfunctions and poor customer service. On Tuesday, officials said they kept their promise to fix the system.
"Is there going to be some confusion on Day One? Yes. But since March 14 when the old center closed, nobody has been able to get their account information and today we handled [more than] 20,000 calls," Orlando said. "We've got a good system in place."
