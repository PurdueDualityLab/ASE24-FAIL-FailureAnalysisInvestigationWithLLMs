E-ZPass cheats better watch it;New contractor means full enforcement is back

The Record (Bergen County, NJ)
ln
The state today will resume large-scale enforcement of E-ZPass toll cheats and the 15 mph speed limit at toll plazas on the New Jersey Turnpike and Garden State Parkway, officials said Monday.
State officials also promised that motorists can now expect faster customer service and much fewer false violation notices when ACS State and Local Solutions, the state's new contractor, takes the reins of New Jersey's E-ZPass system today.
'They'll start receiving data from toll lanes tomorrow and dealing with violation notices from that point forward,' Joseph Orlando, a spokesman for the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, said Monday.
ACS, working under a temporary agreement, fixed E-ZPass glitches in most lanes on the state's toll roads, making the enforcement changes possible, officials said. In July, the state suspended issuing violation notices to drivers until it could be sure the lanes were working properly.
The state resumed sending notices in September on a smaller scale, only for lanes that were proven to be accurate, using paper records.
A new E-ZPass customer service center opens today in Newark to handle new accounts, problems, and payments.
During a tour of the center Monday, officials said drivers will spend less time on the phone and will receive fewer false violation notices because customer service and violations operations are now combined in one place with one database.
'The only thing about E-ZPass you should notice is that it works now,' Orlando said. 'We can't stress enough that people once considered violators may not be considered violators again because the technology is that much more sound.'
102 lanes to go
Since it started the remediation work in August, ACS has fixed 320 toll lanes on the parkway and turnpike, with 102 lanes remaining. Those lanes -- 90 on the parkway and 12 on the turnpike -- will be gradually put into service, said the turnpike's executive director, Michael Lapolla.
The state signed a $450 million deal with ACS in December, with the promise that it would clean up the mess left by a string of bankrupt E-ZPass contractors, including WorldCom.
The state's troubled E-ZPass system had relied on toll cheats paying $25 fines to pay for the bulk of the system's $300 million cost. But the revenues did not materialize and there was no method to make sure cheats paid the fines.
Transportation Commissioner Jack Lettiere said he will review options over the next few weeks, examining how other states with similar systems enforce violations.
The previous target date for legislation addressing the issue was March 1.
Some options could include blocking a driver's license renewal or vehicle registration until fines are paid, or hiring a collection agency - a step promised but never delivered under the former administration.
'We'll review our policy on how we handle violators who don't pay,' Lettiere said. 'One step at a time. After doing all of this, we don't want violations affecting good customers. ... I'd rather do it well than have it be the weakest link in the chain.'
The state also is developing a policy in which repeat offenders would lose E-ZPass privileges. Details have not been worked out.

Improving E-ZPass
E-ZPass customers are expected to get information about their accounts in 25 seconds, compared with 90 seconds, and all transponders are tested and cleaned before they are mailed. The new service center, on McCarter Highway in Newark, has 288 phone lines and can handle 17,000 calls a day, nearly double the previous number. It will be open Saturdays. Customers can get information on a new Web site, www.ezpassnj.com, or can call (888) AUTO-TOLL.
