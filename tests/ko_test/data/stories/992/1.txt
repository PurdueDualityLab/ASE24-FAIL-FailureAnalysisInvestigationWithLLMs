NEW YORK, Reuter - Trading on New York's major commodities exchanges was delayed Tuesday because of technical problems, the exchanges and traders said.
The New York Mercantile Exchange said the opening of its energy futures and options would be delayed due to a price reporting problem.
"There seems to be some kind of technical problem," said one floor trader at the exchange.
An exchange spokeswoman said it would give the market 15 minutes notice before opening trading.
No further details were available.
The exchanges were closed by last February's terrorist bombing of the World Trade Center building complex.
Trading at Commodity Exchange Inc. was halted at about 9:45 a.m. EDT (13:45 GMT) due to a technical glitch in price dissemination, a COMEX spokesman said.
"We have stopped trading in all of our markets as of a few minutes ago due to a problem with the price reporting system that is universal to all of the CEC ( commodity exchange center)," the spokesman said. "We do not have an estimated time on a restart.
The Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange Inc. also trade due to technical problems, a CSCE spokeswoman said.
The spokeswoman had no other information on the cause of the problem.
When dealings at CSCE were halted, cocoa and coffee futures had been trading.
