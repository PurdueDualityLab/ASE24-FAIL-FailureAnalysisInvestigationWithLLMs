NEW YORK, June 15, Reuter - Trading at Commodity Exchange Inc (COMEX) was halted at about 0945 EDT/1345 GMT due to a technical glitch in price dissemination, a COMEX spokesman said.
"We have stopped trading in all of our markets as of a few minutes ago due to a problem with the price reporting system that is universal to all of the CEC ( commodity exchange center)," the spokesman said. "We do not have an estimated time on a restart.
Said one COMEX copper trader, "We're standing around, waiting for something to happen."
