Discovery of Yahoo vote glitch reveals scale of Yang revolt

The apparently solid level of support displayed at Yahoo's annual meeting last week for Jerry Yang, its embattled chief executive officer, evaporated yesterday after an admission that the votes of the company's largest shareholder had not been counted.
The glitch exposed a far deeper level of shareholder unhappiness than the company had previously reported with the way that Mr Yang and Roy Bostock, the internet company's chairman, had handled the negotiations over an acquisition by Microsoft this spring. Several big investors criticised them publicly at the time for holding out for too high a price.
Yahoo yesterday blamed an agent acting on behalf of the shareholder, the Capital Group, for the error and said it had carried out its own vote tally properly.
The bizarre chain of events that led to the revised vote count was touched off on Monday after it emerged that Capital Group, whose various funds own more than 16 per cent of Yahoo's shares, had asked its agent, Broadridge Financial Solutions, to investigate whether its votes had been tallied properly.
In response, Broadridge said yesterday that a "truncation error in the final tabulation" of the figures it sent to Yahoo had led it to under-report the number of shares for which support was withheld for several Yahoo directors, including Mr Yang and Mr Bostock.
The recount left Mr Yang with only 66 per cent support among shareholders who voted at the annual meeting, far lower than the 85 per cent that Yahoo reported at the end of last week. Mr Bostock received only 60 per cent support compared with the 80 per cent Yahoo said previously.
Holders of roughly 200m extra shares had withheld their support for the directors than originally reported, Yahoo said. That is equivalent to around 14 per cent of Yahoo's outstanding shares, and close to the Capital Research holdings.
A spokesman for the investment firm said the holding was split between a number of funds, each of which had made its own decision on how to vote.
The low level of support for Mr Yang closely echoed a strong shareholder backlash at last year's annual meeting against Terry Semel, then the CEO. Yahoo's directors as a group received only 66.6 per cent support after several shareholder advisory groups took issue with the level of Mr Semel's pay, and he resigned later the same month.
However, one person close to the company said the revised vote count would make no difference to Mr Yang's position, and that it did not affect the official outcome.
