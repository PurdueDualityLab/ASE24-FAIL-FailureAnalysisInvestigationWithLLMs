Yahoo Inc. (YHOO) said a greater number of its shareholders cast votes opposing the re-election of Jerry Yang and other directors than previously reported, after a company responsible for processing shareholder votes said it made a mistake in sending those of one large investor.
Acknowledging the tabulation error, Yahoo said that only 66% percent of votes were cast in support of Yahoo Chief Executive Jerry Yang, down from the 85% it had previously announced. Yahoo Chairman Roy Bostock received a 60% favorable vote, down from 80%. Yahoo director Ron Burkle saw his share of supportive votes fall from 81% of votes cast to 62%.
The disclosure did not affect the outcome of Friday's shareholder election, in which all directors were reelected. But it does weaken the endorsement Yang and other board members involved in negotiations with Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) received during Yahoo's shareholder vote last Friday.

At the time, some investors expressed surprised that the Yahoo's board - and Yang, in particular - had received such an overwhelming endorsement amid so much investor griping. While much of that appears to have subsided, the revised counts suggest that frustration with Yang and other members of the Board persists.
Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc. (BR), which processed votes on behalf of Capital Research Global Investors, was responsible for the glitch. Capital Research, which owns at least 6% of Yahoo, has been a steady critic of the Yahoo Board's decision to reject a number of offers from Microsoft.
Chuck Callan, senior vice president of regulatory affairs at Broadridge, said that a printout Broadridge sent the voting tabulator mistakenly cut off the first digit of the number of shares the investor wanted to withhold for certain directors. The incident was isolated and triggered by a unique combination of factors, including the fact that at least 100 million shares were being withheld. Broadridge - which processes votes for some 14,000 meetings a year - determined that no other meetings within the past 18 months were affected and has fixed the problem, Callan said.
Broadridge investigated the matter Monday at the request of Capital Research Global Investors, which had recommended withholding votes for Yang and suspected that the number of withheld votes ought to have been higher.
Governance experts said that glitches aren't uncommon in proxy voting - a complex process involving a number of companies who oversee casting, counting and certifying votes.
But such errors often fly under the radar unless someone presses for an investigation, says Claudia Allen, chair of the corporate governance practice group at Neal Gerber & Eisenberg LLP, a Chicago-based law firm. "Most of the time these things happen you don't hear about them," she said, describing this as a case of a shareholder "sending a message."
