Discovery of Yahoo voting error reveals scale of revolt over Yang

The apparently solid level of support displayed at Yahoo's annual meeting last week for Jerry Yang, its chief executive officer, evaporated yesterday after an admission that the votes of the company's largest shareholder had not been counted.
The glitch exposed deeper shareholder unhappiness than the group had reported with the way Mr Yang and Roy Bostock, the chairman, had handled negotiations over an acquisition by Microsoft this spring.
Several big investors criticised them publicly at the time for holding out for too high a price.
Yahoo yesterday blamed Capital Group, an agent acting on behalf of the shareholder, for the error and said it had carried out its own vote tally properly.
The chain of events that led to the revised vote count was touched off on Monday after it emerged that Capital Group, whose various funds own more than 16 per cent of Yahoo's shares, had asked its agent, Broadridge Financial Solutions, to investigate whether its votes had been tallied properly.
Broadridge said yesterday that a "truncation error in the final tabulation" of the figures it sent to Yahoo had led it to underreport the number of shares for which support was withheld for several Yahoo directors, including Mr Yang and Mr Bostock.
The recount left Mr Yang with only 66 per cent support among shareholders who voted at the annual meeting, far lower than the 85 per cent Yahoo reported at the end of last week. Mr Bostock received 60 per cent support compared with the 80 per cent Yahoo said previously.
Holders of roughly 200m extra shares had withheld their support for the directors than originally reported, Yahoo said. That is equivalent to about 14 per cent of Yahoo's outstanding shares, and close to the Capital Research holdings.
The investment firm said the holding was split between a number of funds, each of which had made its own decision on how to vote.
The low level of support for Mr Yang echoed a backlash at last year's annual meeting against Terry Semel, then chief executive. Yahoo's directors as a group received only 66.6 per cent support after several shareholder groups took issue with the level of Mr Semel's pay, and he resigned later the same month.
One person close to the group said that the revised vote count would make no difference to Mr Yang's position and that it did not affect the official outcome.
