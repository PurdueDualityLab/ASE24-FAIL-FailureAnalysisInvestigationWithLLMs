The Internet chess match between Garry Kasparov and the collective might of the rest of the world has descended into chaos, with the champion assured of victory but his cyberspace challengers claiming that they have been robbed of a result by Microsoft, the organizer of the match.
For four months the marathon game has been extremely close, but in the past few days Kasparov, the world champion, created a positional advantage that guarantees victory.
Participants in the match say they were not given the chance to make a move that could have secured a draw.
The match has progressed by a single move every day, with four young chess masters providing analysis and a choice of responses to each Kasparov move.
The advisers to the world team include Elisabeth Pahtz, 14, a German schoolgirl talent-spotted by Kasparov, who regards her as a rising star.
In what was touted as the biggest interactive game, players all over the world considered the advice then voted for what they thought was the best move.
The exercise in democracy appeared to be working well, with the world lasting longer than expected against the grandmaster.
However, on the 58th move, in a tricky endgame, a move suggested by Irina Krush, 15, one of the best women players in the world, was not offered to participants, apparently because of technical glitches.
On her Web site, Krush said that her move was ''far superior'' to the ''losing move'' that was selected, and the many followers of her analysis agreed.
''Fiasco farce chess game'' and ''You have destroyed a work of art'' were among the messages posted on the bulletin board of Microsoft's match site.
Krush's own site said that she had had trouble sending her move in by e- mail and when she finally succeeded a further technical problem at Microsoft rendered her recommendation unavailable for review.
''It is unfortunate that an event of this importance to the chess community suffered a technical malfunction,'' said her Web site, but conceded that this was the first time ''such a difficult and farsighted event had ever been attempted''.
After the debacle Krush ''retired'' and her supporters tried to voice their protest by making a suicidal move. But that move, even though legal, did not appear on the site.
Microsoft said it was not posted because it was a ''stuffed vote.'' They said it was the first majority vote that was not recommended by one of the analysts guiding the team.
Some players said that Microsoft's disregard for the protest move showed that it could not distinguish between stuffed and legitimate votes.
Microsoft representatives said that the accusations were unfair.
On Wednesday, Kasparov was close to victory and opinion was divided on whether the world team should resign.
