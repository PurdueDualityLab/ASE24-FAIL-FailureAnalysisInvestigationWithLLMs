THE Internet chess match between Garry Kasparov and the World has descended into chaos, with the champion assured of victory but his cyberspace challengers claiming they have been robbed of a result by Microsoft, the match's organiser.
For four months the marathon game has been close, but in the past few days Kasparov has created a positional advantage that guarantees victory. The Times of London has reported that participants in the match say they were denied the best advice -- a move that could have secured a draw -- at a critical stage.
The match has progressed by a single move a day, with four young chess-masters providing analysis and recommending a response to Kasparov's moves.
The advice was posted regularly on Microsoft's Web site -- www.zone.com/kasparov/
home.asp. In what was touted as the biggest interactive game yet, players all over the world considered the advice then voted for what they thought was the best move.
But on the 58th move, in a tricky endgame, a move suggested by adviser Irina Krush (58 ... Qf3-f5) was not offered to participants via the Microsoft Web site, apparently because of technical glitches.
Instead, the World's voters selected a move suggested by two of the other three advisers. Krush, 15, is the US women's champion and was the undisputed leader of the World's advisers.
She says her move was 'far superior' to the 'losing move' (58 ... Qf3-e4) that was selected, and many followers of her analysis agreed.
'Fiasco farce chess game' and 'You have destroyed a work of art' were among the messages posted on the bulletin board of Microsoft's match site.
Krush said she had trouble sending her move by e-mail. A technical problem at Microsoft stopped her recommendation appearing on the site.
After the debacle, Krush 'retired' and her supporters protested by voting for a suicidal move. But that move, even though legal and popular, was not played.
Microsoft justified this by claiming a 'stuffed vote' -- repeat voting by individuals, even though the company previously maintained it was impossible to stuff votes.
The company's representatives said the accusations were unfair, the game had been conducted within the rules, and Krush's move was not posted because it arrived too late.
Kasparov is reported to have found a win against Krush's move as well and yesterday was close to victory.
