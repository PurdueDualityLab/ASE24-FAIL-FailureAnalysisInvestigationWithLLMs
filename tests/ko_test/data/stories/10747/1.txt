We were robbed, say world chess team

THE Internet chess match between Garry Kasparov and the collective might of the rest of the world has descended into chaos, with the champion assured of victory but his cyberspace challengers claiming that they have been robbed of a result by Microsoft, the match organiser.
For four months the marathon game has been extremely close, but in the past few days Kasparov created a positional advantage that guarantees victory. Participants in the match say that they were not given the chance to make a move that could have secured a draw.
The match has progressed by a single move every day, with four young chess masters providing analysis and a choice of responses to each move by Kasparov. The advisers to the world team include Elisabeth Pahtz, 14, a German schoolgirl talent-spotted by Kasparov, who regards her as a rising star.
In what was touted as the biggest interactive game yet, players all over the world considered the advice then voted for what they thought was the best move.
The exercise in democracy appeared to be working well, with the world lasting longer than expected against the grandmaster.
However, on the fifty-eighth move, in a tricky endgame, a move suggested by Irina Krush, 15, one of the best women players in the world, was not offered to participants, apparently because of technical glitches.
On her website Ms Krush said that her move was 'far superior' to the 'losing move' that was selected, and the many followers of her analysis agreed. 'Fiasco farce chess game' and 'You have destroyed a work of art' were among the messages posted on the bulletin board of Microsoft's match site.
Ms Krush's own site said that she had had trouble sending her move in by e mail and that when she had finally succeeded a further technical problem at Microsoft rendered her recommendation unavailable for review.
'It is unfortunate that an event of this importance to the chess community suffered a technical malfunction,' said her website, but it conceded that this was the first time that 'such a difficult and farsighted event had ever been attempted'.
After the debacle Ms Krush retired and her supporters tried to voice their protest by making a suicidal move. But that move, even though legal, did not appear on the site. Microsoft said that it was not posted because it was a 'stuffed vote'. They said it was the first majority vote that was not recommended by one of the analysts guiding the team.
Some players said that Microsoft's disregard for the protest move showed that it could not distinguish between stuffed and legitimate votes.
Microsoft representatives said that the accusations were unfair, that the game had been conducted within the rules, that Ms Krush's move was not posted because it arrived too late and that they were 'totally agnostic' about the outcome.
Yesterday Kasparov was close to victory and opinion was divided on whether the world team should resign.
