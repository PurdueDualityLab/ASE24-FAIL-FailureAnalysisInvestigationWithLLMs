Garry Kasparov has been playing chess against the Rest of the World via the Internet for the last four months. Expert players would provide suggestions and analysis, and players from around the world would vote.
Irina Krush soon became the favourite of the fans. They voted for her suggestions 53 times in the first 57 moves. Unfortunately, a technical glitch prevented her from making a suggestion for move 58 and the Rest of the World had to play without her.
As a result, the move made was inferior to her suggestion. But either way, Kasparov was still in the driver's seat.
For move 59, the Rest of the World committed suicide by placing their queen on a square where it could be captured for nothing.
The move had not been suggested by any of the experts. It turns out that at least one player, a fellow by the name of Jose Unodos, had found a way to vote 250 times by creating multiple zone IDs.
Microsoft, sponsors of the event, canceled the move and offered the Rest of the World a choice of moves, which included resignation. As it turns out, only 28 per cent of respondents voted to resign. Most instead made another move, which allowed the game to continue.
The game goes on, but without the help of Irina Krush, who decided to withdraw after the incident on move 58 where her move was not made available to the public.
According to Microsoft, there were between 6,000 and 10,000 voters each day, and although multiple voting had been detected, they believed it had not influenced the moves chosen, except in the case of move 59.
Although there are many "World Chess Champions" these days, as chess goes the route of boxing, Garry Kasparov remains the best player in the hearts of chess players around the world.
This despite the fact that he did not take part in the World Chess Federation (FIDE) world championship, which was won recently by Alexander Khalifman, and that Kasparov's own attempts to organize private matches for himself have been canceled twice because of a lack of sponsorship.
Kasparov has not played often in the last year, but each time he has participated, he has simply outclassed the field, finishing first. In Linares, Spain, last March, he scored 10.5 points out of 14 to finish 2.5 points ahead of Vladimir Kramnik and Viswanathan Anand.
I was speaking with Kasparov's agent recently about the possibility of having Kasparov come to Montreal. He actually has room in his schedule during the week of Dec. 10. The cost is about $40,000 per day. For this, he gives a simultaneous exhibition and a short lecture. Maybe someone reading this would be interested in putting something together.
