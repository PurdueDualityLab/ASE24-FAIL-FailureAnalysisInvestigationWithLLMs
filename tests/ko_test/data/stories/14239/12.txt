Boo.com, a British online sports clothing retailer, has collapsed after the failure of a last-ditch effort to raise additional funding.
Shareholders announced late Wednesday night that they were calling in the receivers KPMG. The failure six months after the Internet company was launched with much publicity will mean the loss of about 300 jobs and deal a blow to Europe's Internet industry.
Boo.com, founded 18 months ago by two Swedes, is the first major European Internet business to close down. French entrepreneur Bernard Arnault and Italy's Benetton family were among the shareholders.
The company, which hoped to create a global online retailing business, was said to be worth about dlrs 400 million at the peak of the Internet market frenzy last year.
But a combination of high setup costs and an inability to attract enough customers led to its demise.
Co-owners Kajsa Leander and Ernst Malmsten issued a joint statement expressing their disappointment.
''The senior management of Boo.com has made strong efforts over the last few weeks to raise the additional funds which would have allowed the company to go forward with a clear plan,'' they said in the written statement.
Their plan envisioned a restructuring of retail operations and the identification of partners.
''It's all the more disappointing to the management and staff alike that it is not been possible to bring this to fruition against the background of steadily improved trading,'' the owners said.

The high-profile collapse of British online clothing retailer Boo.com Group Ltd. portends a shakeout among Internet firms that specialize in selling goods directly to consumers, industry analysts said Thursday.
Boo.com is the first big European Internet business to go belly up. The High Court appointed accountants from KPMG to liquidate its assets after the company failed in a last-ditch effort to raise fresh funds.
Boo.com's demise came at a time when investors already were losing some of their appetite for the once-sizzling dot-com sector.
However, analysts suggested that plenty of Internet companies should be strong enough to survive the impending upheaval and emerge in a better position to profit.
''Over 70 percent of all business-to-consumer Internet companies will go out of business within the next couple of years. But the ones that survive will make a great deal of money,'' said Michael Whitaker, chief executive of NewMedia Spark, a firm that invests venture capital in new technologies.
Boo.com failed just six months after its widely publicized launch.
Founded by two Swedes Ernst Malmsten and former fashion model Kajsa Leander the firm had hopes of becoming a global online retailer by building on the concept of peddling clothes using three-dimensional, electronic mannequins.
Malmsten and Leander tapped heavyweight backers such as French entrepreneur Bernard Arnault and Italy's Benetton family for dlrs 125 million in startup funds. Boo.com was said to be worth some dlrs 400 million at the peak of last year's Internet investment frenzy, and it aimed to issue its first shares to the public later this year.
But technological glitches delayed Boo.com's launch, and slack controls on spending together with the departures of a finance director and other key personnel contributed to a dangerous drain on the company's cash.
Unable to raise millions of dollars in new financing, Boo.com's directors announced late Wednesday that they were asking KPMG to liquidate the firm.
Its failure means more than the loss of 300 jobs.
''I think it's a warning shot across several people's bows,'' said Ian McEwen, an analyst at Lehman Brothers in London.
Dot-com firms that sell to retail customers have fallen out of favor with investors, and the wave of initial private offerings by Internet startups has dwindled as a result.
''It's quite tough at the moment to get backing for those types of companies,'' McEwen said.
The looming shakeout also could extend to dot-coms that sell to businesses, as big players such as General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. cut out online middlemen by forming their own Internet purchasing networks.
A report this week by PricewaterhouseCoopers claimed that the majority of Britain's publicly traded Internet firms could run out of cash within 15 months. It said a quarter of them are likely to run dry within the next six months.
David Kemp of the London brokerage Brewin Dolphin said this weakness has been exacerbated by a number of companies that floated shares too soon, before building up a more stable base of funding from venture capitalists.
''The Internet hasn't changed the fundamental laws of business,'' Whitaker said. ''For the retailer, it's just a new way to reach the customer. It's a new form of the old merchandise catalog.''
Online retailers selling intangible goods such as plane tickets and financial products stand a better chance of survival than those peddling clothes, which require proper fitting, he said.
Boo.com suffered from specific problems, and analysts warned against generalizing too much from its experience.
''I think this tarring of the whole segment with the same brush is a mistake,'' McEwan said.
He took an almost Darwinian view in arguing that an industry shakeout would be a good thing for investors and consumers alike.
''What this means is those deals that do get done will offer people quite a lot of value,'' he said. ''So as far as I'm concerned, it's pretty healthy.''
