Boo backers must decide whether to cut their losses.

When the history book of the millennium e-tail boom is written, a whole chapter is likely to be dedicated to one company. Online sportswear and fashion retailer Boo.com has come to epitomise the roller coaster ride of Internet start-ups.
The site is undeniably ambitious and youthful, but negative media coverage, logic-defying marketing spend, launch delays, technical glitches and high-level defections have all blighted Boo's short history.
Sympathisers have said problems were inevitable as Boo is the first of its kind. Detractors have espoused the theory that a good idea has been eclipsed by lack of retail knowledge and sluggish sales. Last month, Boo reported underlying sales of GBP 430,000 in its first quarter.
Last week, newspaper reports suggested that even Boo's backers, including French entrepreneur Bernard Arnault and clothing group Benetton, are seeking a sale of the e-tailer to minimise losses from the estimated GBP 80 million they pumped into it. This is categorically denied by Boo. A spokeswoman said second-round funding of 'close to' GBP 30 million is being sought from the original investors, and should be secured in the coming weeks.
One of Boo's problems is that the viability of selling clothes on the Net is largely untested. The senior vice-president of a well-known management consultancy, who asked not to be named, says: 'If you start with the basic premise that shopping for clothes is an experience, then Boo was counting on the fact that it could recreate the same kind of experience on the site. I don't know if that is possible.'
As clothes shopping is largely an impulse activity, customers may think a five-day delivery time is too long.
Confused message
Another challenge was that Boo had to build a brand from scratch. A GBP 10 million marketing campaign ensured ads appeared in all the 'right' magazines.
However, they failed to explain what Boo was and what it sold. Furthermore, the campaign began in June - Boo's original 'launch date' - but the site did not go live until November. With no reputation to fall back on and negative reports circulating, the effectiveness of the ads is questionable.
'Did the ads work and did they attract the right type of people? Possibly, but those who actually bought something once they got on the site were not the number that Boo hoped,' says the consultant.
A Boo spokeswoman says the ads were part of the brand-building exercise, but would not reveal how many visits had actually been made to the site.
Most criticism of Boo has centred around its technology. Advanced graphics packages mean that the site is slow to use and - for weeks following launch - it did not function on Apple Macintosh computers.
Gifi Fields, chief executive of fashion house Coppernob, believes the technology is 'unnecessarily elaborate' and stems from the over-zealous ambitions of - and the high budget available to - Boo's founders, Ernst Malmsten and Kasja Leander. 'It's like giving kids unlimited access to sweets, without anyone there to stop them consuming them. They were excessive and ate the lot,' he says.
The spokeswoman claims the site is constantly being updated. 'We have improved on the platform since launch. It's quite accessible now. But we are making changes to the front end that will make the site more functional,' she says. A revamped site will launch before the autumn.
Fields says Boo's profile is so high that if it were to be sold - and therefore deemed a failure - it will set back the development of e-commerce by years. 'It won't affect the public's confidence because they don't care, but it will affect the confidence of business and the investment community,' he says.
The management consultant says the future of Boo rests on whether its investors believe a new brand has genuinely been created. 'If they (investors) think Boo is a good brand name, then the investment could be harvested.
If they're not getting the feedback from the marketing, then I'd pull the plug.'
