The collapse of British online clothing retailer Boo.com Group Ltd. portends a shakeout among Internet companies that specialize in selling to consumers, industry analysts said Thursday.
Boo.com is the first big European Internet business to go belly up. The High Court on Thursday appointed accountants from KPMG to liquidate its assets after the company failed in a last-ditch effort to raise fresh funds.
Boo.com's demise comes at a time when investors already are losing some of their appetite for the once-sizzling dot-com sector.
However, analysts suggested that plenty of Internet companies should be strong enough to survive the impending upheaval and emerge in a better position to profit.
'Over 70 percent of all business-to-consumer Internet companies will go out of business within the next couple of years. But the ones that survive will make a great deal of money,' said Michael Whitaker, chief executive of NewMedia Spark, a venture capital firm.
Boo.com failed just six months after the widely publicized launch of its Web site.
Founded by two Swedes, Ernst Malmsten and former fashion model Kajsa Leander, the company hoped to become a global brand using its advanced Web site, where three-dimensional mannequins showed off the wares.
Malmsten and Leander tapped heavyweight backers such as French entrepreneur Bernard Arnault and Italy's Benetton family for $125 million in startup funds. Boo.com was said to be worth some $400 million at the peak of last year's Internet investment frenzy, and it aimed to issue its first shares to the public later this year.
