The resounding thuds of Boo.com and Digital Entertainment Network hitting the floor are the best evidence yet that the long-awaited .com shakeout has arrived with a vengeance.
The e-tailer and the online entertainment company were two of the most high-profile Internet ventures, and had attracted some deep- pocketed backers.
Splashy online sportswear retailer Boo.com will liquidate after just six months of operation, having burned through all but $500,000 of the original $135 million it raised.
Original backers - such as Bernard Arnault, the Benetton family, and the investment banks J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs - were unwilling to pony up more cash to support the floundering operation, which has suffered from technical glitches, weak sales and a lack of merchandise.
Founder Ernst Malmsten told reporters that he had been "too visionary" without controlling costs, but insisted that "in Boo.com there is a formula for a successful business."
An executive at KPMG Corporate Recovery, which is handling the sale, said potential buyers for some or all of Boo.com were already calling.
Scandal-plagued Digital Entertainment Network, also known as DEN, has also run out of money. It is shutting down its operations and considering filing for bankruptcy.
DEN, which produced and aired online shows targeted at Generation Y, was once considered one of the hottest Web start-ups. Former Warner Bros. head Terry Semel, Microsoft and Dell Computer were all backers.
But DEN foundered after The Post disclosed it was lavishing top execs with seven-figure pay packages and signing bonuses, and after a lawsuit was filed alleging that founder Marc Collins-Rector had sexually abused a 13-year-old boy.
Collins-Rector resigned, but the company never really recovered.
This February, it canceled plans for an IPO, and despite raising $24 million afterward, DEN ran out of cash this week, as The Post reported it would several weeks ago.
There is plenty of other evidence of dot-com turmoil - in the form of layoffs.
KBkids.com, the online arm of KB Toys, recently fired 45 of its 145 employees - about a third of its workforce.
CarOrder.com has also laid off a third of its workforce.
AltaVista announced last week that it would cut 40 of its 800 employees, about 5 percent. The layoffs come one month after the Internet portal postponed its IPO.
Quepasa.com, a portal targeting Latinos, says it will cut its staff by one third. Company officials did not say how many employees work there now.
And WeddingChannel.com laid off about a third of its 150 workers last month, following its merger with Della.com.
Other sites have sold out to larger players: Makeup e-tailer Gloss.com just sold itself to Estee Lauder, for example.
Some are selling equity stakes. Online grocer Peapod, on the verge of extinction, let offline grocery giant Royal Ahold buy a chunk of the company. Illustration
