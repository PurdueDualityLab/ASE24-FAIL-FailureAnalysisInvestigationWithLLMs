After investing more than &Acirc;90 million ($236 million) in boo.com, investors in the failed internet retailer could be walking away with as little as &Acirc;250,000 ($656,000), total.
Reports in British newspapers say the internet clothes store founded by a former fashion model has been sold to the internet services company Bright Station for about a third of 1 per cent of the cost of setting it up.
Founders Ernst Malmsten and Kajsa Leander would be let go, along with the 220 staff members already laid off, according to reports.
But other reports say the company's liquidator, KPMG, is still in negotiations with other parties to sell the extravagant internet failure.
KPMG had been hoping to announce a buyer on Saturday, but that deal was not closed in time and negotiations with six potential buyers continued through the weekend, according to a report in London's Daily Telegraph.
The Wall Street Journal reported, however, that a Dutch broadband company, Chello, was in exclusive talks with boo.com. Chello has a joint venture with pay-TV company Austar to bring broadband internet services to regional Australia.
Now dubbed 'boohoo.com', the e-tailer went belly up earlier this month only six months after its launch.
A dicey cash-flow position, due to online revenues failing to keep pace with pricey advertising campaigns, was exacerbated by series of technical glitches with the site, and the founder admitted they had overspent their large budget.
Although the site has been roundly criticised for being too flashy and therefore too slow for any would-be customer without a high bandwidth internet connection, the laid-off staff have started a website, postboo.com, in the hope of selling their skills.
But that site, too, uses relatively slow-loading graphics.
