The Massachusetts Turnpike Authority has sacrificed more than $1.2 million this summer by waiving tolls to relieve traffic backups caused by the introduction of the Fast Lane automated toll collection system.
In July, the first full month of the system's operation, toll collectors waved 653,642 vehicles through tolls at Exits 1 through 15, resulting in a loss of $785,130 in tolls, according to figures compiled by the turnpike authority. In July 1998, 58,453 motorists were allowed to go through without paying; costing the turnpike $75,889.
"While these are big numbers, they have to be viewed in terms of the overall turnpike volume," turnpike spokesman Robert R. Bliss said. "In the context of the annual total revenue, the losses from waiving tolls are about one-quarter of 1 percent."
Turnpike tolls were $9.3 million last month, compared with $9.8 million in July 1998. Turnpike revenues for the first half of 1999 were $2.1 million ahead of the same period in 1998, Bliss said. Traffic has been increasing 3 percent to 5 percent a year for the last several years. Annual turnpike revenue is about $180 million.
Critics of the turnpike say that the losses from not collecting tolls are major, and an indication that the Fast Lane program is failing.
"Fast Lane did not create more commuters," said Harold Hubschman, spokesman for the Framingham-based Commuter Tax Relief Coalition, formerly the Free the Pike Coalition.
"People are using the Pike because ridership of the Pike goes up each year anyway," he added.
The turnpike also has sacrificed money at the tolls this month. Some 370,000 drivers had tolls waived from Aug. 1 to Aug. 19, sacrificing $423,851 in revenue.
Turnpike officials say the lost income is a necessary start-up cost of the Fast Lane program.
They hope the electronic tolls eventually will process traffic more quickly and smoothly, but stubborn glitches have plagued the $70 million system, including toll plaza congestion and speeding.
Each interchange on the turnpike has lost regular traffic lanes, causing lengthier backups for vehicles not equipped with the small, box-like transponders that make the system work.
"We're not afraid to do this. We're not ashamed to do this," Bliss said of the toll waiving. "It's a traffic management tool. What we're trying to do is move traffic through the toll plazas."
While more drivers than ever have been given free passage through the tolls this summer, the trend appears to be on its way down. So far, tolls have been waived at a lower rate in August than last month.
Bliss maintains that the need to waive tolls will lessen as Fast Lane use increases and traffic is reduced in regular lanes.
The turnpike has sold about 120,000 Fast Lane transponders at $27.50 each. Another 17,000 free transponders have been given to Western Massachusetts drivers, and a special arrangement allows 70,000 subscribers to New York's similar EZ-Pass system to use the Massachusetts system.
Some 70,000 transponders were in drivers' hands when the system debuted statewide June 30.
The devices attach to vehicle windshields and allow drivers to pass through automated tolls without stopping. Tolls are deducted from accounts users set up with the turnpike.
Transponders are selling at the rate of about 1,000 a day, and Fast Lane use has risen markedly through the summer at nearly every interchange from Western Massachusetts to the Newton tolls.
The system has been in operation inside Route 128 since October. At rush hour in the Boston area, use is approaching 45 percent. Officials predict a higher percentage of Fast Lane users with the end-of-summer return of some commuters next month.
However, turnpike critics are skeptical that more motorists using the Fast Lane program will alleviate pressure on toll lanes staffed by human collectors.
"They say it's going to get better, but all we are seeing is it's costing them more and more money," Hubschman said. "It's not getting better, and people are getting more and more inconvenienced. Most people don't use Fast Lane and won't use Fast Lane."
Hubschman has long advocated removing tolls from the entire turnpike. He and other members of his group - which is collecting signatures for a ballot initiative to give tax credits for turnpike tolls - view toll waiving as an evil.
But Bliss notes that waiving tolls is not always something to complain about.
"There are a certain number of people out there who think it's not a bad thing when you don't have to pay a toll on the turnpike," he said. Illustration
