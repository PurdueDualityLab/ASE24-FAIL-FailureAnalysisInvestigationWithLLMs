SO NOW we know. Victorians will elect a new State Parliament on Saturday 18 September after the shortest allowable campaign, 25 days. The Premier, Mr Jeff Kennett, rightly observed yesterday that Victorians would be relieved that speculation about the election date was now over, and that the question of who will govern for the next four years would soon be resolved. We suspect, however, that some of the other comments the Premier made after his visit to the Governor, Sir James Gobbo, to seek the dissolution of Parliament should be taken with a large grain of salt. Mr Kennett said, for example, that he had chosen 18 September only because speculation about the date was getting out of hand, and that he would have preferred to go to the polls in March, after the Grand Prix. Within the broad limits set by law, the timing of an election is decided by the government of the day, and Mr Kennett is too shrewd a politician not to have chosen the date that suits him best.
The election will overlap the AFL finals, an upbeat time of the year in Victoria. In Melbourne, the CityLink tollway will have been operating for long enough to be appreciated by motorists, though probably not long enough for e-tag glitches or the payment of tolls to take the gloss off it. CityLink has been an iconic project for the Kennett Government, and the Premier might be expected to want to reap as much as he can from the fact that it has opened. But issues of timing and achievement are now secondary. The crucial issue for this campaign will be what the Government, which has officially announced the end of its austerity program, proposes to do if it wins a third term.
Labor, which trails the coalition by a wide margin in opinion polls and enters the campaign with an inexperienced leader, will hope that the Government cannot provide a clear and satisfactory answer to that question. Yesterday Mr Kennett spoke of the need to maintain the momentum that the Government has created, and to give access to 'the latest in social care, education, medical and hospital facilities and services, and community services'. But he made no specific promises.
To topple this Government is a tall order: Labor would need to win 15 seats in the Legislative Assembly, with an overall swing of more than 5 per cent. But whether or not Mr Steve Bracks replaces Mr Kennett as Premier on 18 September, the election could still usher in a sea change in Victorian politics. For seven years, debate has been dominated by the question of the state's financial security. If, however, the Opposition can lock the Government into debating the specific provision of community services - especially in education, health and transport - this campaign could switch the public agenda back to the things that sound financial management is supposed to sustain.
