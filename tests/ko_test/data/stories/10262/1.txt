WANT to know about Jeff Kennett's deep and abiding affection for Ruby?
Click on www.jeff.com.au and the showbiz Premier's personal secrets are all laid out. Well, sort of. Ruby is Kennett's dog, a hungarian viszla, and the Web site is a novel election tactic dreamed up by Liberal Party headquarters and Sausage Software.
The Liberal Party is so convinced of Kennett's personal popularity that billboards advertising the Web site are springing up around town, a pitch aimed straight at young Victorians.
The site itself is a glowing tribute to Kennett and a source of basic information about the Liberal Party.
Why does he love his dogs so much? 'They greet you as a long lost friend when you go home at night, they're faithful, responsive ... absolutely unquestioning,' explains Kennett.
There are personal snaps of the Premier, electorate information, policy overview, and tidbits from the Premier's diary.
There are long blurbs about Kennett's beloved Hawthorn football team and his memories of 'standing on the hill with the traditional Four'n'Twenty pie slathered in sauce'.
There's Jeff the fashion plate -- 'a dedicated leader of fashion' -- illustrated with risque photographs of Kennett with young female models.
And if you're interested, find out 'what motivates the Garden State's best known gardener when he delves into his backyard'.
There's an interactive grand prix car race and coming soon an interactive election-strategy game.
All good clean fun, with little in the way of serious politics. Plus there's a chance to e-mail the Premier, though Liberal State director Peter Poggioli refused to say how much time Kennett would spend over coming weeks answering mail.
There's also some unexpected candour: 'Everyone knows that Jeff likes to talk, but you may be surprised to learn that Jeff also listens.'
Dr Poggioli said the party had taken security measures to prevent spoil-sport Labor Party hackers vandalising the site, as happened to an official government site several years ago.
But sometimes glitches sneak in despite the best laid plans: recently the Premier defended his use of a taxpayer-funded exercise bike by saying he used it religiously every morning before 6 o'clock.
Not according to his Web site. Jeff loves his dogs in part because they 'impose a healthy regimen in my daily life -- a five or six kilometre walk around Surrey Hills in the crisp air at 5 o'clock each morning. It makes you feel good to be alive.'
