The Premier, Mr Jeff Kennett, yesterday said he expected City Link tolls would be introduced during the election campaign and denied the toll-free period had played a part in the election timing.
He also said he expected there would be glitches on City Link and complaints from motorists when tolls were introduced.
'Yes, there will be some glitches and some people will get on talkback radio and complain, but that is all just a moment in time,' Mr Kennett said. 'Ultimately it will be fixed and we'll have that piece of infrastructure for the next 500 years.
'Rather than we being in any way concerned about City Link, we actually celebrate it for what it represents: wonderful engineering, wonderful construction skills, wonderful infrastructure and, environmentally, very, very friendly for Victoria.'
Mr Andrew Manton, a spokesman for Transurban said no decision had been made about when tolls would be introduced, and he would not predict if they would begin during the campaign.
The Opposition Leader, Mr Steve Bracks, said he would be concerned if tolls were not introduced during the campaign.
