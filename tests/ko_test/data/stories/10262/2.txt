SAVING PRIVATE VICTORIA.

BEYOND the Victorian economic miracle, which has seen the Kennett Government transform the state from an almost bankrupt economic basket case in 1992 to a thriving powerhouse in 1999, lies some dark clouds.
While the fiscal legacy of Treasurer Alan Stockdale, who departs politics this election, is indisputable, the future of his grandest scheme - the privatisation of the state's electricity system - is far from certain.
Over the next few years the state's electricity generating companies face potential massive losses which could send them broke and, further down the track, there is the prospect of big hikes in electricity prices.
When Mr Stockdale took the keys to the state's coffers, Victorians owed a crippling $32 billion.
Today state debt stands at $6 billion and falling, resulting in an annual saving of $1.7 billion in interest for Victoria's taxpayers.
Governments around the world have taken part in the extraordinary wave of privatisation, but Mr Stockdale led the way in Australia, going further than any government dared.
In seven years, he and Jeff Kennett disposed of every possible state asset to cut debt, from ports to prisons, railway stock to schoolyards, TABs to the state insurance office and the jewel in the crown - the former State Electricity Commission.
The only major unsold state business is the water supply system which Mr Kennett has repeatedly declared to be off-limits to the private sector.
The spin-offs of the biggest asset sell-off in Australia's history has been the reduction in the interest being charged to Victorian taxpayers with the subsequent easing of Budget pressures, as well as the re-establishment of its AAA credit rating which means a lower rate of interest being charged.
The debt disposal enabled Mr Kennett to implement his vision for Victoria using profits from asset sales to build grand civic monuments from art galleries and museums to aquatic centres and city squares.
But the downside to the firesale is the state has been left with a much narrower revenue base and is increasingly reliant on gambling taxes. In this year's state Budget gambling taxes comprised 15 per cent of revenue, while income from public authority enterprises fell to 3.3 per cent of total government revenue - or $647 million.
By taking the plunge early, Mr Stockdale achieved some extraordinary prices for assets, bagging $4.89 billion for the Loy Yang power station and coal mine in April 1997 - the biggest price paid for an electricity generation asset in the world.
On the other hand, the state has almost lost forever the income stream from those assets worth tens of billions in future revenue.
While many assets were a drag on the Victorian Government, many were profitable enterprises even when the interest being charged on loans was taken into account.
NSW last year made a net $1.2 billion profit from its state enterprises - or $190 per person - after paying $2.5 billion in interest.
But the sale of monopoly public assets is a "one-off" - having dumped the businesses, it is almost impossible for any government to buy them back.
Furthermore, as Mr Stockdale has been pointing out all week, there is no mechanism to stop a profligate future Treasurer - Labor or Liberal - running up a massive debt in the middle of a crippling recession.
The only problem will be next time around there will be no public assets to draw on.
In the immediate future Victoria's privatised power industry faces an uncertain period as all states down the eastern seaboard link to a national electricity grid.
Victoria's private generators are already losing money in competition with the larger government-owned companies of NSW and Queensland which do not have to take into account the commercial realities of start-up capital costs of building or buying generators.
Under the original National Competition Policy grand plan, the giant state electricity monopolies were to be broken up and sold into smaller and, hopefully, more efficient private hands which would in turn result in competition and cheaper electricity prices.
Mr Stockdale courageously led the way, privatising the Victorian system and urging NSW, in particular, to follow suit.
National competition policy is like international free trade policy - it often works better in theory than practise requiring all the players to play by the same rules.
Unfortunately for Mr Stockdale, the playing field is not level and has no prospect of becoming level with Labor governments in NSW, Queensland and Tasmania shelving privatisation plans.
The Labor states still cross-subsidise their more inefficient power stations with their super efficient power stations, making it impossible for Victoria to compete.
The outspoken former chief executive of Loy Yang power station, Bob Patterson, declared earlier this year Victorian power stations were being forced to sell electricity for as little as $20 per megawatt hour.
But he said power stations needed to charge an average $35 a megawatt hour to break even.
This means Victorian wholesale electricity prices will need to almost double, with the subsequent flow-on effect for Victorian consumers.
And it is always possible that power companies which paid big prices for power stations in Victoria could go broke over the next few years.
Mr Stockdale has even suggested this is a possibility.
The other glitch the national competition policy economists apparently forgot is Victoria is stuck with "wet brown coal", which is less responsive to high electricity load times than the "dry black coal", with which NSW and Queensland are blessed.
In the United States and Europe there is a trend towards private industry re-aggregating privatised generation systems because the break-up of monopolies has gone too far.
