City Link loses $1m each week

Motorists using City Link during the toll-free period have been asked to install their e-tags so that the computer system can be tested properly.
City Link's owner, Transurban, which admits it is losing about $1million a week in potential toll revenue, said about 80per cent of drivers using the link at the moment were not carrying e-tags.
A spokesman, Mr Andrew Manton, guaranteed motorists they would not be billed in error during the testing phase if they installed e-tags.
He said the database being used for the testing was a copy of the real version and was not linked to the billing system.
Transurban has struggled to get motorists to carry their e-tags since the road opened on 15 August, and the Opposition's transport spokesman, Mr Peter Batchelor, warned drivers to be wary of installing e-tags, because they could be billed in error.
Controversy engulfed City Link's billing system last month after it was revealed that a customer was charged $1645 because Transurban wrongly deducted money from her account 329 times.
The western leg of City Link, which connects the Tullamarine and West Gate Freeways, has been opened toll-free while Transurban tests the central toll computer system under 'live' conditions and fixes glitches that it says are holding up the start of tolling.
The toll-free period was planned to be a minimum of a week, but is now expected to be closer to three weeks.
Mr Manton said more e-tags were needed to put the central toll computer system under greater pressure so that it could be properly tested.
Transurban has ruled out competitions and incentives to encourage people to put in e-tags. More than 300,000 e-tag accounts have been opened so far.
But Mr Batchelor said the reluctant e-tag use indicated that motorists lacked confidence in Transurban.
Mr Manton said carrying e-tags would:
Help identify faulty ones (expected to be fewer than 1 per cent).
Allow motorists to familiarise themselves with e-tag beeps.
Allow the computer system to be tested under peak traffic conditions.
The RACV also wants motorists to use their e-tags. A spokesman, Mr David Cumming, said he had confidence in Transurban's assurances that drivers would not be wrongly billed.
The second leg of City Link, the southern link, will connect the West Gate and Monash Freeways, and is due to open in late October.
Testing of the smoke management systems in the Domain and Burnley tunnels on the southern link started yesterday.
