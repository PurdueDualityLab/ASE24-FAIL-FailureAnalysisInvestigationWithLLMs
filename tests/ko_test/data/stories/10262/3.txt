TRANSURBAN said yesterday it could not be certain that tolls would be introduced on Citylink during the current election campaign.
Earlier in the day, Premier Jeff Kennett said he believed tolls were likely to come into force before the September 18 election.
A Transurban spokesman would only say that tolls 'could come in before (September's) poll'.
Tollway critics and the Labor Party have claimed tolls are unlikely to be imposed during the campaign.
Transurban says software problems with the sophisticated tolling system have delayed the introduction of tolls.
A spokesman said seven days' notice would be given before tolling was introduced.
Mr Kennett denied he had any private knowledge of when tolls would be introduced. 'I suspect that at some stage in the next four weeks we're likely to hear that tolls are going on, and they will probably come on during the election campaign,' Mr Kennett said on 3AW yesterday.
However, Mr Kennett could not deny that toll bills would not arrive until after the campaign, as he did not know exactly how the billing system would work.
He also acknowledged there would be 'glitches' in the billing process, which could surface soon after tolling started.
'I don't know. I would imagine that there would be some glitches. But I don't know how the billing system is going to work, even for the glitches. I mean, if a glitch occurs, you're not going to know about it. How are you going to know about it?' Mr Kennett said.
An RACV spokesman yesterday described as 'irresponsible' radio reports that new black spots were occurring as a result of Citylink.
While there had been some minor accidents, claims about black spots could only be made after six months' or a year's record of accidents, he said.
RACV members were 'overwhelmingly satisfied with Citylink and the club itself had been satisfied by road safety audits completed before its opening.
