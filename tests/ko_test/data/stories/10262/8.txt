Liberals jump the gun just a site too soon; ELECTION 2000

The Liberal Party has blamed a technical glitch for election e-mails being posted to the Premier, Mr Jeff Kennett, a month before the poll was called.
On the Liberals new Internet site, www.jeff.com.au, users are invited to 'discuss the issues with Jeff'. Users send e-mails with answers provided under Mr Kennett's name.
The site was launched with much fanfare last Wednesday, the day after Mr Kennett announced the election would be held on 18 September.
Mr Kennett has so far received many e-mails on a host of policy issues. A selection of the latest questions and answers appear on the site.
According to the site, all the e-mails available for perusal by users were posted across three days in late July, a month before the election was called and the site was set up.
An ALP spokesman said yesterday it appeared the e-mails were 'as real as the people in the Liberal Party ads'. The Liberals have used paid actors in their latest round of television advertisements.
But Liberal state director, Dr Peter Poggioli, yesterday denied the e-mails had been prepared in advance.
He said the e-mails were genuine and had been sent by new users to the site.
A technical problem might have been responsible for the e-mails carrying the incorrect date, he said.
The site's project manager, Ms Carolyn Guerin, of Sausage Software, said yesterday that the e-mails had been posted since the launch last week.
Ms Guerin said the company would take immediate action to rectify the situation.
