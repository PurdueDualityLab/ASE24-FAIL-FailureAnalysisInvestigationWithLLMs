Notice to the 339 shoppers whose Cheerios came without a coupon: The slips have been found.
Audrey Henning bought a box of Cheerios that was short on O's _ but stuffed with 340 coupons worth 50 cents off.
The bonanza, which General Mills blames on an assembly line glitch,was discovered recently when Henning's great-granddaughter tried to fix herself breakfast. When the girl opened a brand-new box of cereal and poured, hardly anything came out.
"There was some cereal inthe bottom and a little bit on top," recalls Henning, 81, of Calamus, Iowa. She complained to the company.
General Mills smoothedthings over by sending Henning a Betty Crocker cookbook, plus plastic doo-dads for her great-grandchildren.
Henning plans to bestow the coupons on her granddaughters and friends.
