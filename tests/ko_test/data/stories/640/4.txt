WASHINGTON, D.C. - The nation's industrial output dropped last month by its largest margin in nearly a year as virtually every industry from autos to chemicals cut production.
The weak economy and falling energy prices continued to keep inflation well in check with wholesale prices declining 0.3 percent in January, their biggest drop in 10 months, the government said yesterday.
The worse-than-expected 0.9 percent drop in industrial production was particularly disappointing because it came only a day after reports showing a big jump in auto sales in early February and rising retail sales last month.
Shareholders to focus on exec pay
Executive pay, not South Africa or the environment, is expected to dominate the agenda of emotional issues during the 1992 shareholder annual meeting season, which begins next month.
A movement against the gluttonous compensation deals that many top corporate officers award themselves has been spurred by federal regulators, who are making it easier for shareholders to understand, review and speak up about executive pay.
"Companies are always defensive about it because they don't have an explanation," said Ralph Whitworth, president of the United Shareholders Association, a group pressing for more accountability over management salaries.
New rules for petrochemical industry
WASHINGTON, D.C. - Employers in the petrochemical industry will be required to analyze job hazards and develop ways to guard against explosions and other catastrophes under government safety rules issued yesterday.
The regulations, written by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, are designed to prevent the type of fatal plant explosions that have hit the petrochemical industry in recent years.
More than 3 million workers at nearly 25,000 job sites in the United States will fall under the new OSHA standard, the Labor Department estimated.
The new regulations could prevent some 250 job-related deaths a year and another 1,500 injuries and illnesses, the agency estimated. Falling real estate prices hurt many
WASHINGTON, D.C. - Declining real estate values may force Americans in many cities to pay higher taxes or see services cut, a study financed by the real estate industry said yesterday.
The Economic Growth Alliance, a non-partisan group formed by the industry, released the study in an attempt to show that collapsing real estate prices hurt individuals, families and communities as a whole.
It said the decline in real estate prices results in decreasing property tax revenues, lost jobs and resulting cutbacks in human services.
Study casts doubt on methanol claim
WASHINGTON, D.C. - A study by the petroleum and automobile industries cast doubt yesterday on whether the widespread use of methanol-powered vehicles will provide the environmental benefits claimed by the fuel's supporters.
The findings reflected tests conducted as part of a research effort aimed at determining how best to meet the nation's future air quality goals. California officials, among others, have banked heavily on using methanol vehicles to help reduce urban smog.
Leaders of the study group, Auto-Oil Air Quality Improvement Research Program, said its findings produced no clear evidence that vehicles using fuel with 85 percent methanol, known as M85, produced significant advantages in cutting smog-producing pollutants.
Glitch has woman rolling in coupons
CALAMUS, Iowa - Notice to the 339 shoppers whose Cheerios boxes came without a cents-off coupon inside: They've been found.
The box of Cheerios that Audrey Henning bought was short on O's but stuffed with 340 coupons worth 50 cents off.
The bonanza, which General Mills blames on an assembly line glitch, was discovered recently when Ms. Henning's great-granddaughter was trying to fix herself a bowl from a brand-new box and couldn't get much of anything to pour out.
Revco reorganization vote gets OK
AKRON, Ohio - Drug store chain Revco D.S. Inc. yesterday got court approval for its bankruptcy reorganization disclosure statement, meaning creditors will now be able to vote on the plan.
A hearing was set for March 11 to review the results of the voting. Revco filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in July 1988 after a leveraged buyout.
Revco's plan is now the only one left since rival Jack Eckerd Corp. decided to drop its takeover offer. Revco agreed to pay Eckerd $7.5 million to cover its expenses. Eckerd's plan would have merged the two drugstore chains.
World Toyota operating profits plunge
TOKYO - Toyota Motor Corp.'s operating profits for the second half of 1991 plunged 62 percent from a year earlier, the company announced yesterday, in a sign of increasingly difficult times for Japan's auto industry.
Toyota, Japan's largest auto maker, said higher costs and the appreciation of the Japanese yen were primarily responsible for the drop in operating profits to 77.03 billion yen, or $606.5 million.
It was the first time in 11 years that the company's operating profits fell below 100 billion yen, or $787 million, for a six-month period, news reports said.
