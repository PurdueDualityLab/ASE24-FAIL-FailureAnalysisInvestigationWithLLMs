Audrey Henning hit a Cheerios bonanza, which explained why 339 other shoppers didn't get their cereal coupons.
Henning lives in Calamus,Iowa. She bought a box of Cheerios. It was a bit short on O's. But it had 340 coupons. Each coupon is worth 50 cents.
Henning, 81, eats a lot of Cheerios. But she figures it would take her 28 years to use them all. They have no expiration date.
She's going to bestow them on her granddaughters and friends.
General Mills makes Cheerios. It said a glitchin the automated filling line caused the problem. Henning's great-granddaughter discovered it. She couldn't get the cereal to pour out of a new box. The reason: There was just a tiny bit of cereal. The rest was coupons.
"I told them I gotgypped," Henning said. General Mills sent her a Betty Crocker cookbook and a bunch of plastic doo-dads for her great-grandchildren.
