Instead of cheerful box of O's, coupons, coupons, head to toes

Notice to the 339 shoppers whose Cheerios boxes came without a cents-off coupon inside: They've been found.
The box of Cheerios that Audrey Henning bought was short on O's but stuffed with 340 coupons, each worth 50 cents off.
The bonanza, which General Mills blames on an assembly line glitch, was discovered recently when Henning's great-granddaughter was trying to fix herself a bowl from a brand-new box and couldn't get much of anything to pour out.
'There was some cereal in the bottom and a little bit on top but I told them I got gypped,' said Henning, 81, of Calamus, a town in east-central Iowa. The company smoothed things over by sending Henning a Betty Crocker cookbook plus plastic doo-dads for her great-grandchildren.
General Mills officials said they believe a glitch in the automated filling line caused the problem.
'The problem is that the other 339 packages near that one didn't get a coupon then,' said spokeswoman Kathryn Newton, who said she had never heard of a similar incident.
If Henning, who admits to eating 'a lot of Cheerios,' bought one box of Cheerios a month, it would take her more than 28 years to use all the coupons. They have no expiration date.
Instead, Henning plans to bestow Cheerios coupons on her granddaughters and friends.
'When I have ladies here on Tuesday I'm going to let them all have some,' she said. 'I'll never use that many.'
