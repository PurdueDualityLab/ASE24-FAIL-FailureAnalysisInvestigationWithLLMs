No. 715 played out exactly the way Barry Bonds wanted he hit it at home, in front of the fans who love him.
The San Francisco slugger passed Babe Ruth on the career home run list with a mammoth shot yesterday, and now stands behind just one man.
Hank Aaron owns baseball's most revered record with 755 homers. And so the debate begins will Bonds stick around long enough to break it?
"If you keep playing long enough, anything is possible," Bonds said following the Giants' 6-3 loss to Colorado. "I'd like to win a World Series and be home run king. I'd like to do both. I would take a World Series first."
Bonds' latest milestone was a 445-foot, two-run shot to centre before a sellout crowd. The homer came on the last day before the Giants begin a road trip to Florida and New York.
"For the fans of San Francisco, it can't get any better than this - even though I made them wait longer than I have in the past," he said. "Age ain't catching up with me."
But at 41, Bonds has been slowed by health problems. He had three operations on his right knee last year, and also has bone chips in his left elbow. And many believe his rapid ascent up the home run chart was fuelled by steroids, though he has denied knowingly taking them.
Bonds homered off Byung-Hyun Kim in the fourth inning. The ball glanced off a fan's hands about 15 rows up and then dropped onto an elevated platform beyond the fence.
The souvenir sat there for a few minutes before rolling off the roof and into the hands of 38-year-old San Francisco resident Andrew Morbitzer, who was waiting for a beer and peanuts.
Bonds connected at 2 14 p.m. on a 90-m.p.h. fastball with the count full, then raised his arms and clapped his hands before beginning his historic trot.
"It's a great honour," said Bonds, who watched Aaron hit his 715th homer at age 10. "Hank Aaron is the home run king and I won't disrespect that ever."
Bonds embraced and kissed his 16-year-old son, bat boy Nikolai, as he crossed home plate, then was greeted by his teammates at the top of the dugout.
In a weird twist, Bay Area fans listening on radio station KNBR missed the homer because the micrphone of play-by-play announcer Dave Flemming cut out.
"Three-and-two. Finley runs. The payoff pitch, a swing and a drive to deep cen ..." - that's all listeners got.
Flemming's partner, Greg Papa, finished the call a short time later, apologizing for the glitch.
Flemming still managed to find humour in it all.
"If you only heard the rest of the call. It was an unbelievable call," he said. "Too bad we don't have the proof." Illustration
