KNBR strikes out on home run call

The most important home run call of Dave Flemming's young radio career turned into an all-time KNBR glitch, ruined by technical difficulties and historic bad timing.
The result: An apparent microphone malfunction Sunday wiped out almost all of Flemming's radio call of Barry Bonds' 715th home run, leaving listeners with only crowd reaction at the climax of the historic blast.
'I thought I made a good call,' Flemming said after the game. 'But nobody will ever know. ... I'm disappointed. I'm trying not to be ticked off.'
Flemming, who had play-by-play duties in the fourth inning, said all was well as Steve Finley walked and Bonds' at-bat started. But seconds after Bonds hit the pitch, Flemming's mike went dead.
Here's what KNBR listeners heard: 'Finley runs, the payoff pitch, a swing and a drive! Deep to cent ... '
For the next five to eight seconds, there is only wild crowd noise. Then Greg Papa, Flemming's partner for the day, frantically jumped in to recap the moment.
Which was merely Bonds passing Babe Ruth.
What was the rest of Flemming's lost call?
'I think,' Flemming said, 'it was something like. ... 'It's gone! That's it! A Ruthian shot to pass the Babe.''
Flemming, who didn't call No. 714 (Duane Kuiper was on the play-by-play for that inning), said he felt the worst for the listeners left without a clear description of such an epic moment.
'It's the Curse of the Bambino,' Flemming said. 'His final gasp.'
