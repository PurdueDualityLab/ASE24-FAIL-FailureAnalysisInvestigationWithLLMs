We've all been in that situation in Halo 2 deathmatch, running around on a killing spree, feeling like jade shimmering gods, when all of a sudden sniper bullets will start raining down from the heavens. Who is that asshole countergravitationally skating across the sky box, killing everyone with impugnity? Jesus? Some no good hacker? And more importantly, how the heck do I get up there to pull the same low down trick?
Well, good news. Via Cathode Tan, we discovered this excellent resource for exploting Halo 2's many, MANY architectural glitches. It is apparently possible to get to the top of any level and snipe away and these guys have videos to prove it.
Who the heck spends the time to figure these things out anyway? FLORIAN ECKHARDT
