KNBR on no-call: equipment failure; Mic processor the likely culprit

Equipment failure and not human error or sabotage knocked out the microphone of Giants broadcaster Dave Flemming as he called Barry Bonds' 715th career home run Sunday, according to KNBR program director Lee Hammer.
After examining the equipment following Sunday's glitch, Hammer determined that a mic processor (which sends the audio signal to the engineering equipment) failed, causing Flemming's mic to go dead, just as Bonds' fourth-inning home run was leaving the ballpark.
'Ten seconds sooner and I would have been able to correct it or get Dave a different mic,'' said Hammer, who was subbing for producer/engineer Lee Jones on the broadcast. 'It was an equipment failure at the worst possible time.'
It is the exquisitely bad timing of the glitch that has spawned conspiracy theories, everything from speculation that Flemming's microphone became unplugged during the excitement to the possibility that KNBR was the victim of sabotage.
The station remained on the air throughout the glitch, field microphones picked up crowd noise and Greg Papa's microphone functioned when he was summoned to go on the air after Flemming's went dead.
Flemming made the entire call on Bonds' home run and did not realize his mic was dead until Hammer started scrambling to get Papa on the air.
Hammer dismissed the idea that the glitch was caused by anything other than the faulty equipment.
Larry Baer, the Giants' chief operating officer, admitted the incident 'was incredibly eerie, to say the least.' Baer still said the Giants are 'satisfied' with KNBR's explanation of what happened.
'We're obviously not happy about the fact that Giants fans missed the full impact of the moment, but in life, certain things are out of your control,'' Baer said. 'We're not hiring Oliver Stone or Jim Garrison or any investigators. We have enough on our plate to go there. We're not dwelling on it. We're moving on.'
The incident is clearly still a sore subject at the station, which misses a signature call because of a very public miscue.
'We're upset for Giants fans and the Giants' organization and we're upset for Dave Flemming,'' Hammer said. 'We definitely did not want to be part of the story.'
Baer said it's a moment that likely will live for a long time.
'Fifty years from now, if anybody puts together a film of odd things in sports, this has got to be at the top of the list,'' Baer said.
