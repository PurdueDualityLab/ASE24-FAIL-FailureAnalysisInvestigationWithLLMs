TeamXbox just posted some scans from the upcoming Halo graphic novel.
The Halo Graphic Novel is an anthology of original stories set in the Halo universe representing an unprecedented display of visual storytelling. Building on the success of the critically acclaimed Halo: Combat Evolved and Halo 2 video games, the graphic novel will feature the series' iconic characters, weapons and scenarios and the epic struggle against the alien threats known as the Covenant and the Flood.
I usually drool over Moebius' stuff, but it's kinda lackluster here. Dig that crazy Simon Bisley, though!
