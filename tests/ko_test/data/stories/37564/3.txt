THE BEST CALL YOU NEVER HEARD: [CITY Edition]

Thirty years from now the perp will come out of the shadows and confess he was the one who deadened Dave Flemming's microphone on Sunday.
"I'm Deep Plug. I pulled it. Had to. Bud Selig paid me well. Sure, it was petty but Bud said it was the only way he could punish Barry and get back at him. It wasn't hard either. Heck, everyone was looking at the ball. And I want to thank Mark Felt for all his support and guidance."
Conspiracy theorists will be holding annual meetings over this one, there's enough fodder here. As Bonds' 715th homer left his bat, Flemming's mike went dead as the ball was leaving the infield. Greg Papa, the No. 2 guy in KNBR's radio booth, didn't lose his mike. No other electrical glitches were reported. No one hit a neighboring transformer with his car. No one spilled a soft drink, tripped or otherwise hatched anything near or dear to Flemming.
It was bizarre, surreal and doggone it, just bad luck, KNBR said. But two veteran radio guys I talked to Tuesday, who have been in the business for 30 years, said they never heard of such a thing happening. Struggling KNBR, desperately trying to catch a break, caught a bad one. It could have been the work of The Electrical Fairy.
Or it could have been a disgruntled former KNBR employee, of which there are many these days. Could have been someone who dislikes Bonds which, of course, is hard to believe. Could be a caller blown off by a KNBR talk show host. Could be a teenager with the electrical IQ of a MIT doctoral candidate screwing around at home. Could be a Dodgers fan under deep cover. Or it could be someone who sneezed and his nose particulates traveled like a laser- guided bomb to an outlet.
Shame Flemming missed his chance at being an immortal. Again, to be fair, Flemming had just as much a chance to become immortal by calling the homer as an electrical short occurred while he was calling it.
Truth to tell, only five times on either radio or television has a sportscaster gotten a big moment so right, so perfect, his words and the event he tagged are recognized coast-to-coast. This is not to disrespect unique talents like Bill King, Johnny Most, Chick Hearn, Lon Simmons, Chuck Thompson, Vin Scully. The list is nearly endless of those with who were great with the gab. The talent of these men travel nationally but their moments of brilliance reside regionally.
The Fab Five:
* "Down Goes Frazier! Down Goes Frazier! Down Goes Frazier!" Howard Cosell said in on January 22, 1973. George Foreman flattens Joe Frazier in Kingston, Jamaica. We may not care about boxing. May even dislike it. No matter. Three perfect words.
* "Do You Believe In Miracles?" Al Michaels records for posterity on Feb. 22, 1980 with America beating the Russians in hockey at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid. The wonder of Michaels' voice reflected the amazement of all, including the Russians.
* "The Giants Win The Pennant!" Russ Hodges said that five times on Oct. 3, 1951 after Bobby Thomson's walk-off homer beat the Dodgers. Repetition usually dulls except for the rare moment a phrase needs to be repeated so the incredulousness can actually penetrate the improbable.
* "They're gone. They're all gone." Jim McKay of ABC revealed the fate of the 11 Israelis kidnapped and killed by Arab terrorists on Sept. 5, 1972 at the Munich Summer Olympics. Never have so few words said so much.
* "The Stanford band is on the field! ... Oh my God! The most amazing, sensational, traumatic, heart-rending, exciting, thrilling finish in the history of college football ... THE BEARS HAVE WON!"
These are just a few of the words Joe Starkey used on Nov. 20, 1982 to describe The Play, the five-lateral sequence that propelled Cal through the Stanford Band and a victory in The Big Game. Never have so many breathless, hyperventilated words been the appropriate response to the most breathless, hyperventilated climax to this or any other game.
Too bad Dave Flemming didn't get a chance to step up to the plate and take his crack at history. The moment has passed. But the story has not. No way. In that Flemming might find himself without a competitor.
See, all we know is that we haven't heard the last of what we didn't hear.
Even Cosell, Michaels, Hodges, McKay and Joe Starkey can't say that.
