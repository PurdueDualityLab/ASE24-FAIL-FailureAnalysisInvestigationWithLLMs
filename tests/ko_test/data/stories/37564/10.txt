Suspects aplenty in KNBR conk-out

THE MOST fascinating subplot that unfolded in the wake of Barry Bonds' 715th home run Sunday was "The Mystery of the Malfunctioning Microphone."
What's fascinating about it is that in the immediate aftermath, no one really broached the possibility of premeditated mischief. Holy Toledo, as Bill King is no doubt shrieking somewhere, for anyone who ever watched an episode of "Columbo" it's almost too easy: This smells of something royally rotten in Radioland.
If ever a bizarre incident was ripe for a conspiracy theory, Sunday's KNBR conk-out at precisely the wrong moment is it. It may be a stretch trying to pin this one on Al Qaeda, of course, but laughing it off as the "the Curse of the Bambino, his final gasp" may be looking at what happened a tad too lightly.
That was broadcaster Dave Flemming's que sera sera lament as he reflected on the glitch that interrupted what would have been a historic call of Bonds' home run both for himself and the Giants' flagship station, just milliseconds after it left Barry's bat and began its upward flight over second base toward the centerfield bleachers.
Come on now, Inspector Clouseau, short of Flemming getting so flummoxed that he kicked the cord out of the wall socket while beginning his live account -- something both Flemming and an engineer would have noticed immediately -- what are the odds of a disconnection at just the moment Bonds connected?
And what are the added odds that it would be just the lead announcer's mike that went dead while a second mike in the booth manned by Greg Papa remained live? By the time Papa scrambled to his station and explained what had just happened, however, the moment was lost forever while Flemming's mike was stilldelivering nothing but humm, baby.
Look, something this coincidental didn't happen to Russ Hodges when he made his "the Giants win the pennant, the Giants win the pennant" call back in 1951. Then again, nobody knew Bobby Thomson's home run was coming 55 years ago. Same thing with Joe Starkey's account of "The Play." You surely would have suspected some Stanford physics major if that call had gone dead while the band was running onto the field. But who would have anticipated such craziness was going to occur?
On the other hand, Bonds' blast was a homer a smirking, scheming saboteur would know was an inevitability. While he or she would have had to exhibit incredible patience to interrupt the signal -- after all, it took Barry the entire homestand to knock No.715 out of the yard -- how difficult would it be to man a magic plug jack every time the Giants' slugger stepped to the plate?
You don't have to be Greg Morris from "Mission: Impossible" to understand that there are key connections running all through AT&T Park where KNBR's baseball blather must flow to get to the outside world. That's a clue, too -- somebody easily could have understood the line layout at the home park, unlike the No.714 shot launched in Oakland, where the wiring is something akin to Dick Cheney's heart.
All of which brings us to the next phase of our 2+2 = n715 investigation: Motive. Gee, who would be so sinister and surreptitious to do such a nasty thing?
Bailiff, trot out the long lineup of logical imps, please ...
Some bitter former KNBR employee. The station recently underwent an ownership change and some folks were unceremoniously given pink walking scrolls. And who can count the number of people let go from The Sports Leader in recent years? Hey, you "Game of Shadows" guys, where are you when we really need you?
Some electronics-savvy listener. Yo, Sherlock, can we be so sure it wasn't some Larry from Livermore type that Radnich cut off one day when the caller wanted to talk about the Sharks' second line?
Somebody who lost out on the job Flemming got. Who knows, there may be some grizzled radio voice out there still miffed that the Doogie Howser of sports broadcasting was in a position to make one of the most historic home run calls in baseball history.
A Bonds-hater who didn't want the moment captured for posterity. Nah, not very many of those to question, eh? He would have nailed Duane Kuiper on Fox SportsNet, too, if he could have been in two places at once.
The A's. In the days of Andy Dolich, they used to play all sorts of pranks on the Giants. Maybe there was still an old marker out. Not going to relinquish your territorial rights to San Jose? Well, here, suck on this.
Yes, there may well be more offenders to add to our conspiracy list. But get out of town with this inexplicable accident stuff. Hah. If you believe that, I've got an $8 AT&T Park beer to sell you.
Nope, it's far easier to swallow that a vandal, still doubled over in hysterics, is responsible for this first-degree airwave assault. And sorry, out of all the plausible possibilities, a fat man dressed in pinstripes whose been dead 58 years isn't one of them.
