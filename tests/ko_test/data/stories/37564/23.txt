Oblivion Patch Leaves Gamers Gray, Bleary-Eyed, Morose

We were all happy about the promises of the Oblivion patch. Well, not about the removal of some of the very glitches that make the game enjoyable -- exploiting Bethesda games seems to be half the fun -- but by the promises of better outdoor frame rates and decreased loading times.
Unfortunately, it turns out these claims were lies. The outdoor frame rates are better, which is nice, but the the load times are worse than they've ever been... at least on the 360 version. The sleight of hand, though, is they may seem shorter because Bethesda pulled the 'Now Loading' screens to disguise the fact.
Apparently, this issue can be partially solved by clearing your 360 cache. But the other bad news is that if you've been stuck by a glitch, the patch does nothing to really remedy it: you'll have to start your jillion hour game over. Boo, Bethesda! Boo! Florian Eckhardt
