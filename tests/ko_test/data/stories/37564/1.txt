We're back-- and it's all thanks to 'Bill,' LST's Supreme Web-Tech Monkey, who pulled off the highway as he left town on a family vacation to fix the security hole we discovered earlier today!!!
Even though Bill does put up with a lot of crap here, this is, in fact, mud
For those of you wondering what in the world happened... we were surprised earlier today to discover a glitch in our administrative software that-- if someone were a devious enough bastard to think of it (i.e., 'Me_Myself_n_I')-- would have allowed anyone to look at our registered reader's IP information and email addresses.
We don't have any evidence or reason to believe that that has happened in the past... but when we became aware of the issue, I made the decison to shut the site down completely until the glitch could be fixed.
It is.
We're back.
Thanks for your patience.
And don't forget to go check out and comment on the post that started it all-- Ahawkalypse Now.
