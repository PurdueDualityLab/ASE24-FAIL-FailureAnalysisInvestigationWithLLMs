Refund flap spurs bill proposal
A Georgia state senator wants to make it illegal for state agencies to take money from residents' bank accounts without their permission.
Republican Mitch Seabaugh, of Sharpsburg, proposed the legislation in the wake of a computer glitch that yanked thousands of dollars in state tax refunds from taxpayers' bank accounts last week.
He said the purpose of the legislation introduced Monday is 'to create a safeguard for taxpayers' and is aimed at making Georgians 'feel that their private banking account is safe and protected from undue government interference.'
More than 30,000 taxpayers had their state tax refunds rescinded last week after the Department of Revenue reversed $12 million in payments because of a $630,000 overpayment. The error caused some taxpayers to overdraw their bank accounts.
ABBEVILLE, ALA.
Son suspected in killings
Police are searching Alabama and into Georgia for a man suspected of killing his parents in Florida.
The Dothan Eagle reported that a warrant has been issued for the arrest of Wade Andrew Williams. Authorities call him the primary suspect in the killing of his parents, Bruce and Sharon Williams, last week in Cottondale, Fla.
Authorities have not released how the couple was killed.
Police said a motorist on Thursday gave a ride to a hitchhiker matching Williams' description who was headed to Abbeville, in Henry County on the Georgia border.
GAINESVILLE, GA.
Body exhumed in murder probe
Authorities said a man's body was exhumed from a North Georgia grave as part of an investigation into how he was killed.
Investigators said the man, 76-year-old Dillard Jewell Crane, died in September 2009 from gunshot wounds.
Authorities said they charged a neighbor, Lewis Dempsey, with murder. Dempsey's lawyer, Jeff Wolff, said his client is free on a $100,000 bond while awaiting trial.
Investigators have said the two men had been involved in a long-standing dispute over a property line in their neighborhood northwest of Dahlonega.
Georgia Bureau of Investigation spokesman John Bankhead said crime lab workers discovered more information about Crane's death that could be documented only by exhuming the body.
