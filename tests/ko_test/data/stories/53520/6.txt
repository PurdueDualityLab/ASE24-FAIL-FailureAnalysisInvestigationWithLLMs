ATLANTA (AP) - The head of the Georgia Department of Revenue said the agency tried to head off a computer glitchthat removed tax refunds from the bank accounts of more than 30,000 taxpayers over the weekend before the payments were processed.
Commissioner DougMacGinnitie, who was just appointed to his job about a week ago, said the department issued about $12 million in tax refunds on Thursday, but quickly realized that it had paid out about $630,000 too much.
The department attemptedto reverse the payment on Thursday and thought it had stopped the deposits from being made. On Monday, the department realized the payments had been processed over the weekend and later reversed, leaving many Georgians who had already started spending their refunds facing bank fees for overdrawn accounts.
MacGinnitie says therevenue department is reprocessing the tax refunds as quickly as possible and is hopeful the payments will be reissued this week, though he could not say with certainty when all of the repayments would be made. Meanwhile, the department is working with the banks to waive overdraft fees.
"Once we became aware, wedid everything we can," McGinnitie said as he offered an apology to taxpayers during a press conference.
Robert Freeman ofValdosta told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that he noticed his 2010 refund in his account on Sunday, but that the funds were missing Tuesday.
"It happened to me and mybrother-in-law," Freeman said. "Unfortunately, he spent his $500 and now he is running around trying to cover bad checks."
Taxpayers can visit thedepartment's website to print out a letter they can take to their banks to clear up the matter, which McGinnitie said he expects to happen. People without access to the Internet can call the revenue department for a copy of the letter.
The department is still investigating to determine exactly how the error happened.
