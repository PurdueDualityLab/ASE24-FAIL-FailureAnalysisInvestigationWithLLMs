The Minnesota Department of Revenue said a computer glitch delayed tax refunds for thousands of Minnesotans who filed electronically.
At least 9,000 taxpayers expected to see their refunds deposited directly into their bank accounts. But that didn't happen. Instead, paper checks were sent through the mail.
Revenue Department spokesperson Kit Borgman said the delay happened because of a computer system upgrade. Borgman said multiple platforms and multiple applications of tax types were combined into one unified system and that there were some errors.
Revenue officials said the checks should be in taxpayers' mailboxes within several days.
