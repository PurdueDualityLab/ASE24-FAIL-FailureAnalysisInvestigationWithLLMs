HEADLINES
A state lawmaker has filed a bill that would crack down on illegal immigration in Georgia and that mirrors some provisions in a controversial law that took effect in Arizona last year. The 'Illegal Immigration Reform and Enforcement Act of 2011' was filed by Rep. Matt Ramsey, a Peachtree City Republican who co-chaired a legislative study commission on illegal immigration in the fall. The Georgia legislation would require law enforcement officers to, when enforcing other laws, try to determine an individual's immigration status if an officer 'develops reasonable suspicion' that the person is an illegal immigrant. The bill would also impose penalties on people who encourage an illegal immigrant to come to Georgia or who transport or hide illegal immigrants once they're in the state.
ODDS & ENDS
The push to allow Sunday alcohol sales in Georgia's grocery and convenience stores is being revived with new legislation filed in both chambers of the General Assembly. And new Republican Gov. Nathan Deal reiterated that if the measure ends up on his desk he'll sign it, so long as it allows local communities to ask voters to decide.
The Senate voted unanimously to undo ex-Gov. Sonny Perdue's veto of a budget overhaul bill. But the House is opting for a different approach with GOP leaders saying they prefer pushing a new bill rather than resurrecting an old one. Speaker David Ralston said the House will send the Senate's bill into committee and introduce its own budget reform legislation.
The head of the Georgia Department of Revenue said the agency tried to head off a computer glitch that removed tax refunds from the bank accounts of more than 30,000 taxpayers over the weekend before the payments were processed. Commissioner Doug MacGinnitie said the department issued about $12 million in tax refunds on Thursday, but quickly realized that it had paid out about $630,000 too much.
Gov. Nathan Deal has signed an executive order directing the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority to develop and launch the Georgia Water Supply Development Program, which will help local governments develop new sources of water supply. He said he is also negotiating with the new governors of Florida and Alabama to resolve the gridlock.
QUOTE
'The House is more interested in working today than fighting yesterday's battles with a governor who is no longer here and has gone home,' House Speaker David Ralston, explaining why he will push a new bill on zero-based budgeting rather than taking up a Senate override of a veto Gov. Sonny Perdue issued on the same issue last year.
DAYS IN SESSION
34 days remain in the 40-day session.
LOOK AHEAD
The head of the Georgia Student Finance Commission will testify before the House Higher Education Committee on Tuesday and is expected to discuss the status of the state's cash-strapped HOPE scholarship program.
