State error hits 30,000: Giving, taking back tax refund appears legal. Some suffer insufficient funds after $12 million pulled back from banks.

The state Revenue Department issued $12 million in tax refunds beginning last week to more than 30,000 Georgians and then took the money back, leaving many people overdrawn and wondering where their money went.
Revenue Commissioner Douglas J. MacGinnitie, who was appointed Jan. 18, apologized to taxpayers Wednesday and said a series of errors led to the problems.
The mistakes left Jenny and James Richards of Macon in an embarrassing situation. Their account contained $700 Tuesday morning, Jenny Richards said, and she invited her husband to lunch at Applebee's. By lunchtime, however, the state had taken back their tax refund.
"When you have $700 in your account, you don't think to check it before you go to lunch," Jenny Richards said.
Her debit card was rejected for insufficient funds, leaving the couple with no way to pay; at length, Jenny Richards' father covered the tab with his credit card over the phone.
MacGinnitie said a computer glitch caused the state to overpay about $640,000 in some of the refunds issued last Thursday, so the department issued a stop payment order three hours later to banks handling the transactions.
"We thought we could stop the whole transaction and clean it up," MacGinnitie said.
He said department workers did not know refunds had been deposited into people's accounts before the order was issued, and he believes the department had the authority to rescind the payments just like a stop-payment order on a check. A spokesman for Wells Fargo & Co. on Wednesday confirmed that conclusion, saying any customer has a right to try to correct a mistake in timely fashion.
And Bobby Schwartz, a banking attorney with Smith Gambrell & Russell, said if the department stopped payment on the refunds that quickly, it did so legally.
That's not much consolation for Georgians who saw the money show up in their accounts last Thursday and then saw it vanish days later. Like many others, Jenny Richards said no one notified her of the rescinded payment.
Bill Nemeth, president of the Georgia Association of Enrolled Agents, a trade group for tax preparation experts, said his clients saw the problem as early as Saturday and began contacting him. The problems continued Monday and Tuesday, and the department still had not notified people.
"This is causing a lot of hardship since taxpayers are writing checks against their accounts and they are bouncing for insufficient funds," he said.
MacGinnitie said he did not realize there was a problem until Monday, when people began calling and asking why the department had taken their refunds back. The department began contacting banks, he said.
The state did not issue a statement about the situation until late Tuesday afternoon, after getting calls from reporters and taxpayers. Taxpayers who spoke with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said they had to spend hours on the phone with the department's Taxpayer Advocate Office to find out what was going on.
Robert Freeman of Valdosta said he was told little other than there was an error, and that there would be a process for appealing bank charges.
And Jay Lawrence, Southeast communications manager for Wells Fargo & Co., said the bank had to call the department Tuesday to find out what was going on after getting calls from customers.
"We reached out to the state [Tuesday], and we offered to work with them and see what we could do to help them sort it out," Lawrence said.
Wells Fargo plans to cancel overdraft fees to any customers, Lawrence said, and MacGinnitie said the department is working with all banks to make sure no one gets charged penalty fees because of the disappearing money.
The department website at https://etax.dor.ga .gov/ has a printable form that can be turned in to appeal bank charges.
MacGinnitie said, "We wanted to make sure we got out correct information and make sure we understood the scope of problem and how we would attack it. That is what we've been working on nonstop to correct the problem."
He said the department began reprocessing refunds Wednesday.
"Clearly, we need to work to make the Department of Revenue more customer-focused I assume that is why the governor asked me to take this job," MacGinnitie said.
