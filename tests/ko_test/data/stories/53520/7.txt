The head of the Georgia Department of Revenue says the agency tried to head off a computer glitch that removed tax refunds from the bank accounts of more than 30,000 taxpayers over the weekend before the payments were processed.
Commissioner Doug MacGinnitie says the department issued about $12 million in tax refunds on Thursday, but quickly realized that they had paid out about $630,000 too much.
At that point, the department attempted to reverse the payment and thought it had stopped the deposits from being made. On Monday, the department realized the payments had been processed and reversed, leaving many Georgians facing bank fees for overdrawn accounts.
MacGinnitie says the revenue department is reprocessing the tax refunds as quickly as possible and is working with the banks of affected taxpayers to waive overdraft fees.
