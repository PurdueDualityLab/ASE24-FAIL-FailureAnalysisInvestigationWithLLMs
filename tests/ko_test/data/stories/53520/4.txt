ATLANTA (AP) - A Georgiastate senator wants to make it illegal for state agencies to take money from citizen's bank accounts without their permission.
Republican state Sen. Mitch Seabaugh of Sharpsburg proposed the legislation in the wake of a computer glitch that yanked thousands of dollars in state tax refunds from taxpayer's bank accounts last week.
He said the purpose ofthe legislation introduced Monday is "to create a safeguard for taxpayers" and is aimed at making Georgians "feel that their private banking account is safe and protected from undue government interference."
More than 30,000taxpayers had their state tax refunds rescinded last week after the Department of Revenue reversed $12 million in payments because of a $630,000 overpayment. The error caused some taxpayers to overdraw their bank accounts.
