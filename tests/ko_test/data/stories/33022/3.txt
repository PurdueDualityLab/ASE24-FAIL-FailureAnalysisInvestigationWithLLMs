WINNIPEG (CP) - It was somewhat ironic that this Prairie city was the location for the Tragically Hip to be inducted into the Juno Music Hall of Fame.
After all, the veteran rockers were fired from their first gig here back in the 1980s.
'We were booked to play for six nights,' recalled singer Gord Downie, while chatting with reporters backstage. 'After the first set we were fired. (The Owner) said he didn't know he'd hired a punk band.'
The outfit, from Kingston, Ont., recently celebrated its 20th anniversary together.
Glass Tiger helped shape my sound: k-os
WINNIPEG (CP) - Joyful Rebellion, named the country's best rap recording at this year's Junos, was partially inspired by '80s group Glass Tiger, rapper k-os admitted following the awards.
'Joyful Rebellion is an earnest, honest Canadian boy saying that he listened to everything from Tribe Called Quest to Glass Tiger,' he said. 'Putting all that in a pot and stewing it around saying 'OK, what was cool about Glass Tiger?' Not much, but there was something cool about it melodically so we took it all and regurgitated and Crabbuckit came out of it.'
Crabbuckit was crowned best single at Sunday's Juno Awards. Altogether, k-os, who's based in Toronto, received three Junos.
Junos suffer technical glitch, producers not sure what happened
WINNIPEG (CP) - At least viewers know Leslie Feist wasn't lip synching after the singer fell victim to a technical glitch during her Juno performance of Mushaboom.
In the middle of the song, the sound cut out.
'You get snake bit sometimes when you do these shows with so much technology,' the show's producer John Brunton said afterwards.
He hypothesized that a signal to Feist's microphone and guitar was somehow cut off.
Feist, originally from Calgary, recovered smoothly with a big grin to the audience, and resumed singing and strumming her guitar.
She came back from the embarrassing moment by winning best new artist. Her CD, Let It Die, won the best alternative album, during the non-televised awards.
Backstage, Feist couldn't explain what happened either.
'Your guess is as good as mine,' she said. 'I heard crackling and (the mic) stop working. I saw techs running around.'
