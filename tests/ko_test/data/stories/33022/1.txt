- Awards shows tend to be critical punching bags, but even the most strident cynic must be forced to concede the 2005 Juno Awards wound up being a respectable affair.
The last-minute absence of ailing marquee star and expat Winnipegger Neil Young had threatened to suck some of the wind out of the Juno celebration's sails, but last night's closing ceremony ultimately triumphed over some logistical and technical horrors with a commendable display of good taste.
If, that is, one can block from memory the ugly sight of Prime Minister Paul Martin cradling an electric guitar to cue up the Tragically Hip's induction into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame.
When the final tally of trophies were handed out during Saturday night's glitzy Juno gala and yesterday's slick CTV broadcast from Winnipeg's MTS Centre, pint-sized Napanee pop starlet Avril Lavigne walked predictably away with a field-leading three awards artist of the year, pop album of the year and the fan-voted Juno Fan Choice award.
As mainstream Canadian stars go, Lavigne - unable to attend because of touring obligations in Singapore - is about as likeable as it gets. But the weekend's other big winners showed the Junos making a bold departure from their usual emphasis on corporate Can- rock and prefab pop and, amazingly enough, acknowledging some of the left-of-centre talents who've been earning this country a reputation in recent years as a hotbed of cool music.
Toronto rapper, singer and songwriter k-os collected two statues - single of the year for his infectious hit "Crabbuckit" and rap recording of the year for his sophomore album, Joyful Rebellion. He also shared video of the year honours with Micha Meisner for the clip for "B-Boy Stance." That song, performed on the broadcast by k- os, his crack band and a posse of dancers, proved one of the evening's most spirited moments.
"A big part of my introduction to doing music was growing up and watching TV and seeing the images on TV and how they stereotype people," he said later, calling his win and his presence on the show "a victory for showing alternate images, showing black people on TV and showing hip hop on TV."
Backstage, k-os - who laughingly termed his unclassifiably eclectic music the product of "an earnest young Canadian boy growing up listening to everything from A Tribe Called Quest to Glass Tiger" - was also eager to share his success with the fellow Canadians reaping critical huzzahs and mounting record sales abroad, despite a lack of support from the traditional industry infrastructure.
"I think Canada has the best bands in the world right now," he said, name-checking such peers as the Arcade Fire, the Dears, Metric, Broken Social Scene and Leslie Feist. "When I'm 60 or 70, I want to realize that Canada changed the world of music."
Broken Social Scene cohort Feist, meanwhile, added another award to the alternative album of the year trophy she took home on Saturday night by scoring something of an upset over mainstream hitmakers like Fefe Dobson, Keshia Chante and Matt Dusk in the best new artist category.
The critically hailed avant-pop crooner also demonstrated herself a model of classy cool onstage when the arena's P.A. system cut out completely midway through a solo performance of "Mushaboom." Unfazed, Feist raised her hands, calmly waited for the sound to kick back in and continued what could well prove a career-making moment, without missing a beat.
"I just showed myself that I can fly by the seat of my pants when I'm singing, but I can't when I'm talking," she later quipped, looking genuinely astonished that she'd won another award.
Backstage, Feist admitted seeing k.d. lang and not winning the award was one of her priorities for the evening.
"I was kind of hoping I wasn't going to win so I could watch her perform," she said, professing that she was still "moved to tears" catching lang's performance on a monitor.
For her part, lang delivered an emotional renditions of Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah" and Neil Young's "Helpless" during the broadcast to a thunderous ovation.
"If there is a beacon or a bastion of an artist who has maintained his integrity and his uncompromising vision and purity ... it is Neil Young. So Neil, I sing this for you. Heal fast my friend," lang said before launching into "Helpless."
John Brunton, executive producer of the Juno telecast, said he had spoken to someone at the consulate who reported that Young was visibly moved by the tribute.
"He actually teared up and thought it was one of the most beautifil things," said Brunton.
Underrated suburban-Toronto rockers Billy Talent were last night's only other multiple winners, taking album of the year honours over heavyweights Lavigne, Celine Dion, Diana Krall and A Simple Plan for their eponymous debut disc and beating out Great Big Sea, A Simple Plan, Sum 41 and the Tragically Hip for group of the year.
Adding to the Toronto totals were Ron Sexsmith, deserving winner last night of his first, long-overdue Juno for songwriter of the year (for "Whatever It Takes," "Not About to Lose" and "Hard Bargain"), two-time winners Tafelmusik Baroque Orchestra, Sum 41, Keshia Chante and Queer Eye for the Straight Guy theme-song composers Widelife. Sarah Harmer, meanwhile, added to the Hip's Kingston cool by winning the inaugural "adult alternative" album of the year statue.
"It's a nice, solid piece," she joked later on. "It's very womanly, too."
By awards-show standards, the winners' list and the live performances last night were remarkable. Besides the memorable turns from Feist, k-os and lang, the Tragically Hip benefited from frontman Gord Downie in full madman stride (best line "Move the U.N. headquarters to Halifax, all right. We'll take care of it from there") during epic performances of "Fully Completely" and "Grace, Too,"
Billy Talent screeched themselves raw and Sum 41 showed a willingness to break with its usual pop-punk tomfoolery with an epic power ballad featuring frontman Deryck Whibley on a grand piano.
Randy Bachman and Burton Cummings performed in a Winnipeg salute alongside enormous local rapper Fresh I.E., who speculated that he'd just made history. "I don't think Burton and Randy ever had a rapper on one of their songs before," he said.
It was a good recovery by a broadcast that, as late as Friday - when news broke that Young was in New York recovering from surgery for a brain aneurysm - looked doomed to disappoint.
Young's absence was the one everyone was talking about, but the final show was also left reeling by 11th-hour cancellations by presenter Dan Aykroyd and seven-month-pregnant hometown gal Chantal Kreviazuk, not to mention the possibility that CTV might bump the telecast in favour of continued coverage of Pope John Paul II's death.
Behind-the-scenes chaos aside, Winnipeg proved probably the most receptive city to the accompanying JunoFest series of club shows since St. John's, Nfld., packing venues for three consecutive nights of sweaty performances by local heroes and imported nominees.
The dense crowds drew ace performances from artists as varied as south-Manitoban trucker/blues guitarist Righteous Ike, ex-pat Winnipeg glam-boy Robin Black and Feist, who wowed the West End Cultural Centre to silence with a ethereal solo performance a couple of hours after picking up her Juno trophy Saturday.
