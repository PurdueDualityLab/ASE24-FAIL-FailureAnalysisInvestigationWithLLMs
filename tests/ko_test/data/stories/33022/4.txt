'That was amazing'

Bartley Kives For the second year in a row, the big winners on the final night of Juno Weekend are acts that care more about making music than selling it.
Anti-establishment rapper k-os and Buzzcocks-inspired rock band Billy Talent were the top two trophy winners at last night's Juno Awards telecast, each winning two glass statuettes during the Canadian music award ceremony at MTS Centre.
By rewarding the pair of critically respected Toronto artists -- and giving nothing to more commercially successful triple nominees Celine Dion, Shania Twain and Simple Plan -- voting members of the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences sent the same message to the music industry this year as they did in 2004 in Edmonton, when Montreal's scruffy Sam Roberts prevailed over corporate-rock behemoths Nickelback.
K-os, who actively expresses disdain for award shows, won single of the year for his infectious Crabbuckit, and rap recording of the year for Joyful Rebellion, the near-unanimous critics' choice for the best Canadian album of 2004.
A Saturday-night Juno win for video of the year gives the Toronto resident a total of three awards for the weekend, which puts him in a tie for the most Juno loot with absent pop singer Avril Lavigne, admittedly a commercial powerhouse herself.
Billy Talent, meanwhile, was named group of the year and won album of the year for its self-titled debut record, which knocked off Lavigne's heavily favoured Under My Skin.
"Where's the guy from last year who said if we won new group of the year it would be the kiss of death award?" singer Ben Kowalewicz asked reporters backstage, referring to... well, me, after the band won the album-of-the-year award.
After taking the group-of-the-year trophy, Kowalewicz described the evening as a dream come true.
"Right now, to be Canadian and be a Canadian band is so important to us," he said, giving props to fellow Toronto artists Death From Above 1979, k-os and others. "We have so many amazing bands in this country."
Lavigne, currently on tour in Indonesia, was granted the fan-voted Fan Choice Award last night. At Saturday's non-televised awards gala, she also was named artist of the year and won best pop album for Under My Skin, which included six songs co-written by Winnipeg's Chantal Kreviazuk.
A more surprising multiple winner this weekend was Calgary-born, Toronto-based singer-songwriter Leslie Feist, who won best new artist last night and saw her Parisian-tinged Let It Die capture the alternative-album trophy on Saturday.
"The most thrilling part of this night for me is I'm on the same stage as k.d. lang," said Feist, the sole Juno artist whose live performance was marred by a technical glitch.
The only other double winner this weekend was Tafelmusik Baroque Orchestra, which won a pair of classical trophies on Saturday.
In other major awards presented last night, Toronto folksinger Ron Sexsmith was named songwriter of the year, while Kingston, Ont., singer-songwriter Sarah Harmer won a new award, adult-alternative album of the year, with her All Of Our Names.
"I want to thank the songs, first," Harmer said in a short speech that credited Winnipegger Marty Kinack, her musical and romantic partner. "I want to thank all the musicians in this country and the wonderful country of Canada. I want to thank the Great Spirit."
In the absence of Dan Aykroyd, Harmer also had the honour of introducing the newest members of the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, fellow Kingston residents The Tragically Hip, who were inducted at the previous evening's non-televised awards.
On Saturday, instead of delivering an acceptance speech, frontman Gord Downie read a fiery, intense poem that amounted to both a vigorous defence of Hip fans -- often derided as hosers by the Canadian music press -- and a roundabout way of thanking as many of their friends and supporters as possible.
Last night was a chance for The Hip to let their music do the talking. They performed Fully Completely and Grace, Too, with Downie inserting some lyrics from Aside, by Winnipeg rock band The Weakerthans, in a nod to the Juno host city.
Winnipeg music got even more air time at the end of the show as Burton Cummings and Randy Bachman led an all-Winnipeg ensemble through a kick-ass medley of Bachman-Turner Overdrive's Takin' Care Of Business and The Guess Who's Share The Land. The Winnipeggers included roots quartet Nathan, rapper Fresh I.E., rock band The Waking Eyes and folk trio The Wailin' Jennys, who won a roots and traditional album Juno for debut album 40 Days on Saturday night.
To acknowledge the absence of Neil Young, still recovering from brain surgery in New York, Alberta-born country singer k.d. lang sang the Winnipeg-raised rock legend's Helpless, backed by members of the Juno-nominated Manitoba Chamber Orchestra.
"I now have the great, great honour, if not bittersweet (task) of filling in for Neil Young tonight," she said. "If there is a beacon or a bastion of an artist who has maintained his integrity and uncompromising purity, it is Neil young.
"So Neil, I sing this for you. Heal fast, my friend."
Earlier, lang also sang Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah, another song from her latest album, Hymns Of The 49th Parallel.
Other performances at the Brent Butt-hosted show included Sum 41's love ballad Pieces (with a full string section), the improbably heavy Single by fiddle-toting Canadian Idol winner Kalan Porter, a frenetic River Below by Billy Talent, a very cool live medley of B-Boy Stance and Crucial by k-os, a disappointingly glitch-ridden version of Mushaboom by Leslie Feist and right off the top of the show, Montreal rock band Simple Plan dishing out Shut Up.
