It was somewhat ironic that this Prairie city was the location for the Tragically Hip to be inducted into the Juno Music Hall of Fame.
After all, the veteran rockers were fired from their first gig here back in the 1980s.
"We were booked to play for six nights," recalled singer Gord Downie, while chatting with reporters backstage. "After the first set we were fired. (The owner) said he didn't know he'd hired a punk band."
The outfit, from Kingston, Ont., recently celebrated its 20th anniversary together.
FEIST-Y RECOVERY FROM TECHNICAL GLITCH
At least viewers know Leslie Feist wasn't lip synching after the singer fell victim to a technical glitch during her performance of Mushaboom. In the middle of the song, the sound cut out.
John Brunton, the show's producer, figures a signal to Feist's microphone and guitar was somehow cut off.
Feist, originally from Calgary, recovered smoothly with a big grin to the audience, and resumed singing and strumming her guitar.
She came back from the embarrassing moment by winning best new artist. Her CD, Let It Die, won the best alternative album, during the non-televised awards.
