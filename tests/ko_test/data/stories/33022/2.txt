It was a bash to remember

The Pope died. Neil Young had a brain aneurysm. Downtown Winnipeg was packed with people for three solid April nights.
Any one of these occurrences would make for a momentous couple of days. Together, they added more drama to Winnipeg's long-awaited Juno Weekend than anyone could have predicted.
Five minutes before the official start of Juno festivities on Friday, news leaked out about Young's brain surgery and his inability to play as scheduled at the Juno telecast last night. The health of the city's most famous musical progeny suddenly overshadowed the event he'd pledged to play for decades, despite the fact it appears he'll be OK.
The next day, the death of John Paul II made the Junos seem completely irrelevant to anyone who wasn't directly involved in the three-day party. A dead pontiff who healed centuries of religious wounds is a little more important than competition between Sum 41 and Simple Plan.
But if you happened to be anywhere near downtown on Friday or Saturday night, you would have found a Fringe Festival-like buzz on Winnipeg's streets, as locals and about 1,200 Juno visitors wandered and cabbed their way back and forth from surprisingly well-attended JunoFest concerts and a handful of decadent invitation-only record-industry schmoozes.
It all led up to the main event, yesterday's sold-out Juno telecast, complete with manic red-carpet ceremony, a polite protest from unhappy IATSE stage techs and more high-decibel hooting and screaming than anyone's heard inside an arena here since the Winnipeg Jets held their last playoff game.
Hosted by Saskatchewan comic Brent Butt, the telecast showcased Winnipeg's incredible enthusiasm -- overwhelming at times, but more endearing than anything -- for the entire nation to see.
The production survived the cancellation of Young, Chantal Kreviazuk and Dan Aykroyd, the threat of pre-emption if the Pope died a day later and even a mystery electronic glitch that forced performer Leslie Feist to stop her performance and restart mid-song.
"That was amazing, wasn't it?" asked producer John Brunton minutes after the show concluded. "It was a white-knuckle ride. It was pretty scary. Every day, we had more bad news."
At the end of the show, fans exiting MTS Centre found themselves in the midst of a miniature post-show celebration organized by the Winnipeg Juno host committee, whose 2 1/2-year job is finally over.
They brought a party to Winnipeg for three days and captured the attention of an expected 1.5 million Canadians for 150 minutes.
In the long term, of course, the Junos won't change much around here.
There are no trickle-down benefits from a weekend of glitz and glamour.
But that shouldn't diminish what took place this weekend: At the end of a long winter, Winnipeg desperately needed a distraction, and this was a distraction on a scale unseen since the Pan Am Games came to town in 1999.
There were a number of memorable moments throughout a weekend that already seems like one big blur.
Last night at MTS Centre, the always amazing k.d. lang delivered two spine-tingling Canadian covers -- Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah and Helpless by the still-recovering Young, who apparently watched the show via satellite from the Canadian consulate in New York.
And the show-closing Winnipeg music tribute, a two-song medley of Takin' Care Of Business and Share The Land cranked out by the unlikely cast of classic rock legends Burton Cummings and Randy Bachman, rapper Fresh I.E., rock band the Waking Eyes, roots quartet Nathan and Juno-winning folk trio The Wailin' Jennys, proved to be way cooler and more emotional than anyone expected.
On Saturday, there was Gord Downie's fiery, defiant defence of Tragically Hip fans, embedded in a poem designed to infuriate the very people who find the singer-lyricist obtuse and indirect. Enough jaws dropped at the Winnipeg Convention Centre to force a saliva cleanup at tables one through 32.
There was also the classy way the Jennys accepted their Juno for best roots and traditional album, with departed member Cara Luft joining ex-bandmates Ruth Moody and Nicky Mehta on the convention centre podium.
And way back on Friday, there was Winnipeg singer-guitarist Greg MacPherson's performance in a gritty Royal Albert Arms that seems like an unlikely place to hold an event officially sanctioned by an organization with a name like the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.
"If you see anyone wearing a (Juno weekend) laminate, punch 'em in the stomach," he implored sarcastically at the end of his set.
Right on, Greg. And right on Wailin' Jennys, Gord Downie, the Winnipeg tribute performers, k.d. lang, the Winnipeg Juno host committee, John Brunton, Young's exemplary team of brain surgeons and everybody in Winnipeg who screamed and organized and protested and volunteered and helped and complained and abused their livers in the cause of making the Junos happen.
This was a party that will not soon be forgotten... if the party can be remembered in the first place.
