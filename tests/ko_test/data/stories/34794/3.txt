THOUSANDS of commuters were plunged into rush hour misery yesterday after a computer glitch on Scotland's busiest rail route.
Furious passengers waiting for the Glasgow-Edinburgh service were told to find other ways of getting to work as they arrived on crowded platforms.
They were among an incredible 15,000 travellers hit after computer systems indicated a signal failure near the Capital's Haymarket Station.
However, maintenance crews from Network Rail later checked out the warning only to discover there was no problem with the signals.
By that time, Glasgow-Edinburgh trains had been forced to terminate at Linlithgow, West Lothian, 15 miles from central Edinburgh.
And thousands of passengers from Fife, Perthshire and beyond were also caught up in the chaos.
Steve Montgomery, of First ScotRail, said: 'We could not get our trains out of our depots and they couldn't depart or get into Edinburgh.
'This had a major affect on all our customers coming in from Fife and from the Glasgow and Dunblane area.'
Problems were first detected at 5am and the first Glasgow train didn't appear in the Capital until after 9am.
Colin Hope, 50, of Edinburgh, arrived in Glasgow at 11am, one-and-a-half hours late for a training course.
He said: 'I've missed most of the morning. It's frustrating. Now I've got the rest of the day to be exhausted.'
Many stranded commuters slammed ScotRail after claiming there simply 'dumped' in Linlithgow.
Ed McCaffrey, 34, from Glasgow, was forced to pay more than 20 for a taxi to Edinburgh. The IT manager added: 'The least ScotRail could do is lay on buses to take us the rest of the way.'
