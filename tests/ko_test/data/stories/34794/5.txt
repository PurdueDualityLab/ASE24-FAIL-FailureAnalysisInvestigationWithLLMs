RAIL commuters faced rush-hour chaos yesterday after a computer glitch hit services.
All trains in and out of Edinburgh Waverley were axed after a signalling fault at Haymarket.
Services from GlasgowQueen Street were cut to two an hour but ended at Linlithgow, where angry passengers were told to make their own way to the capital.
The disruption put more drivers on the road, leading to tailbacks on the Forth Road Bridge and on main routes into Edinburgh.
Services returned to normal after 9am when Network Rail engineers solved the problem
