Signal for chaos

THOUSANDS of commuters endured a rushhour nightmare yesterday after a signal failure brought trains to a halt.
The fault near Edinburgh's Haymarket station jammed signals on red, paralysing services to and from the west and north of the capital for several hours.
Up to 15,000 passengers were caught up in the chaos, which was traced to a computer glitch in the six-year-old system.
The disruption forced packed trains on First ScotRail's flagship Glasgow to Edinburgh line to terminate at Linlithgow, leaving commuters stranded 15 miles outside the capital. GNER and Virgin CrossCountry services were also hit.
Travellers from stations in West Lothian, Fife and on the Dunblane line suffered severe delays and cancellations as engineers from track maintenance company Network Rail struggled to solve the problem.
To make matters worse, commutersin East Lothian were delayed when a freight train broke down at Prestonpans.
Thousands of motorists were late for work as the lack of trains forced extra traffic on to the roads. The M8 and Edinburgh City Bypass were gridlocked and a tailback stretched over the Forth Road Bridge. The congestion-was compounded by FirstBus, one of Edinburgh's main bus companies, running a Saturday service due to a pay dispute.
Spare buses were brought in to operate a shuttle service from Inverkeithing in Fife into Edinburgh, but First ScotRail was forced to fend off angry claims that too few were provided from Linlithgow.
IT manager Ed McCaffrey, 34, paid more than Pounds 20 for a taxi to Edinburgh so he could get to a meeting.
Mr McCaffrey, from Glasgow, said: 'They dumped us in Linlithgow and then left us to make our own way into Edinburgh. I accept that things can go wrong with the rail network, but the least First ScotRail could do is lay on buses to take us the rest of the way. It is just not good enough.' The company's operations director, Steve Montgomery, apologised for the inconvenience and said the signalling problem, which was solved by 9.30am, surfaced at about 5am.
He said the company was unable to run services out of Edinburgh Waverley until just before 8am, when teams of engineers operating points manually enabled a few trains to pass.
Mr Montgomery added: 'Because of the signalling failure, we could only get so far in towards Edinburgh and then you have to be able to find a location where you can turn the trains and send them back again.
Linlithgow is the only point where we can do that at the present time.' He said additional staff were at stations to advise customers but admitted buses were in short supply.
But some commuters were in no mood for apologies. John Lindsay, 40, an engineer from Burntisland, Fife, said: 'I am furious about this. I have just been trying to get a refund because I'm already an hour-andahalf late for work.' Colin Hope, 50, of Edinburgh, arrived in Glasgow 90 minutes late for a course. He said: 'I've missed most of the morning. It's frustrating.' A spokesman for Network Rail said later: 'We will be investigating the full circumstances of this as a matter of urgency and we would like to apologise to all the passengers who have been inconvenienced.'
