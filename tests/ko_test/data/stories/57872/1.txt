CONIFER, Colo. (AP) -Authorities say some of the residents who should have received phone calls telling them to evacuate ahead of a Colorado wildfire didn't get those calls.
Jefferson County sheriff's spokeswoman Jacki Kelley said Thursday the problem was probably caused by a software glitch.
Two people died and another is missing in the wildfire, which erupted Monday in the mountains southwest of Denver.
Authorities believe the fire was caused by a controlled burn that sprang back to life in high winds.
Officials have said 900 households got automated calls ordering them to evacuate, but some residents say they were never called.
It's not clear whether the couple who died received a call.
