Differences in community names as well as a discrepancy between coordinates on Google maps and another mapping system are being blamed for the failure to alert some residents to a deadly Colorado wildfire.
A document released Thursday by the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office indicates that mapping software used by FirstCall Network Inc. didn't recognize where to map homes with different towns listed.
Those homes were placed in an 'unknown' category and didn't receive warnings. The family of one woman believed killed in the fire say that's why she didn't an automated call.
Some who registered their cellphones online didn't get a warning because of a discrepancy between where the provided Google map placed their home and the system used to map landlines.
First Call says it's working to correct problems.
