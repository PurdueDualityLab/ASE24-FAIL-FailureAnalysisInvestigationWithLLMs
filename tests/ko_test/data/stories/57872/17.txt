CONIFER, Colo. (AP) - Thecompany that supplies the automated alert system that warned people southwest of Denver to flee a deadly wildfire says the system worked exactly as it should.
FirstCall Network Inc. handles Jefferson County's system that's designed to automatically calls residents.
Some people say thatafter the fire broke out Monday, they didn't get a call telling them to evacuate before they left their homes.
Sheriff's spokeswoman Jacki Kelley said Thursday that a software glitch may have caused an estimated 12 percent of residents not to receive calls.
But FirstCall PresidentMatthew Teague says the system worked. He says the 12 percent represents residents who either had disconnected numbers or didn't answer.
He says an 88 percent success rate for reaching people on a weekday is a great percentage.
