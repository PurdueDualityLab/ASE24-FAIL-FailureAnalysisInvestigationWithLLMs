'He's happy to be home'

Patrick Bentley smiled and cooed at Hank, an anxious painted horse, as he led him off the trailer.
'Easy, you're all right,' Bentley said to Hank as the horse nudged his snout into Bentley's neck. 'He's happy to be home.'
Hank was one of nine horses who returned to the Aspen Creek Veterinary Hospital on Thursday after officials opened several roads and allowed many evacuees of the Lower North Fork fire to go home. But like all residents allowed home, Bentley and Hank were told to remain on standby and be prepared for a second evacuation.
'That's a significant number of people that get to go home,' said Jacki Kelley, spokeswoman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office. 'They need to be ready to go again.'
Because an initial investigation revealed that a glitch in the emergency notification system prevented 12 percent of targeted phones from receiving a call, Kelley said a patrol car will drive through the area with its lights and sirens blaring if a second evacuation is necessary.
'You don't have 30 minutes (if you hear the sirens),' she said. 'You need to leave now.'
Residents who returned to their homes were urged to pack their belongings and keep them in their vehicles or close to the door.
Search teams continued to expand efforts to find a missing woman, who was identified Thursday as 51-year-old Ann Appel. The Urban Search and Rescue team and its dogs covered about 220 acres Thursday with no sign of Appel.
'We are urgently searching for Ann and appreciate your prayers for her safety,' Appel's family said in a statement. 'We are deeply grateful for all of those helping in the search.'
Officials also continue to investigate the deaths of Samuel Lucas, 77, and his wife, Linda, 76, who died at their home, which was destroyed.
The Lucas family issued a statement late Thursday, saying, 'We are continuing to process the passing of our beloved parents and grandparents. While nothing can replace the loss, we as a family are focusing on celebrating their lives.
'They are continually loved and will be forever missed.'
There will be a memorial service for the Lucases at 1 p.m. today at Southern Gables Church at 4001 S. Wadsworth Blvd. in Jefferson County.
About noon Thursday, as fire crews continued working to contain the fire and extinguish spot fires, officials opened the back roads for the evacuees who were allowed to return to the area near Conifer and Aspen Park. But 180 homes remained evacuated and 6,500 homes are still on standby, Kelley said. There is no estimate for when the remaining residents will be allowed to return.
The residents of those homes that were damaged or destroyed were escorted to their homes and given about 30 minutes to go through their belongings, said Dan Hatlestad, spokesman for the Jefferson County Incident Management Team.
'In most cases there was little to collect,' Hatlestad said.
The 4,140-acre fire exploded to life Monday after embers from a prescribed burn preformed last week by the Colorado State Forest Service reignited in strong winds.
On Monday, Bentley helped load the animals onto trailers as a plume of smoke built and crept over the ridge. The animals were taken to a friend's ranch.
'It looked like a bomb went off,' Bentley said.
On Thursday, a flood of returning vehicles and trailers filled the narrow roads as Bentley made several trips to bring back the horses.
'It was trailer after trailer,' Bentley said. 'These roads looked like I-25 during rush hour.'
