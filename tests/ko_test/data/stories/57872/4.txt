Sheriff, call firm feud

Jefferson County and a company that warns people of imminent danger are grappling over whether a glitch in the company's software failed to notify numerous people about the Lower North Fork fire.
The president of the warning service, Louisiana-based First Call Network, also said of 1,089 calls that went to land lines, 957 were successful, including a call made to the home of Samuel Lucas, 77, and his wife, Linda, 76, who were killed as the fire swept over their property.
First Call president Matt Teague said the relatively few instances where emergency calls were not played to residents came about because of problems such as phones being disconnected and people hanging up before the message played.
He said that Jefferson County sheriff's spokeswoman Jacki Kelley mistakenly reported Thursday that 12 percent of residents near the fire did not receive the calls. He said the calls went out, but for a variety of reasons not related to his company's software, messages were not fully played.
Of those, residents hung up before full notifications were made 36 times, 32 calls were not answered, 90 calls were made to phone numbers that have been disconnected and 12 phones were busy.
County officials disputed Teague.
'We certainly don't see eye to eye on this,' said Mark Techmeyer, spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office. 'We know for a fact that homes did not receive a call that should have. It's a substantial number of people.'
Techmeyer said Teague's explanation of those particular calls appears to be accurate, but the county has identified numerous instances where people on the list did not receive calls. The Sheriff's Office has several people tracking down what went wrong.
'We've got to figure out what happened so we can fix the problem,' he said.
He said that after the evacuations, the Sheriff's Office received numerous calls from residents who should have gotten the calls but didn't. When sheriff's workers checked their stories, they determined that no calls were ever sent to those homes, confirming what they said.
'We believe it's a software glitch,' he said.
Department employees are comparing a list of who received the calls with a list of people who actually got calls. It's unclear exactly how many people did not get calls at this point.
'There's not a bigger thing going on than getting to the bottom of this,' Techmeyer said. 'If it's not the software and it is our fault, we'll say so. When we screw up, no one will scream louder than (Sheriff) Ted Mink.'
Teague said other notification mishaps Monday had nothing to do with First Call software and were the result of human error.
Sheriff Ted Mink said emergency notifications were initially sent out to people throughout Jefferson County who had signed up for e-mail and cellphone emergency notifications instead of just to people in the affected area. Residents not in danger of the fire were flooding dispatch centers.
First Call was formed in 1998 and has between 150 and 200 clients across the country, from small communities to the state of Delaware.
Teague said 88 percent notification is a great percentage.
'It's way above average,' Teague said.
The Jefferson County Emergency Communications Authority pays an annual fee of $60,000 to First Call to maintain its notification system, said Jeff Irvin, executive director of the agency.
