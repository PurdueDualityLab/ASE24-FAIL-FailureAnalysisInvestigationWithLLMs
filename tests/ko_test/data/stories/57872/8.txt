CONIFER, Colo. - Someresidents in the path of a Colorado wildfire weren't warned to flee because of a problem in an automated call system that relayed a mandatory evacuation order, authorities said Thursday.
About 12 percent of thepeople who should have received the calls on Monday did not, Jefferson County sheriff's spokeswoman Jacki Kelley said. The problem was probably caused by a software glitch in system, she added.
Kelley said the countyhad changed to a new automated call system in the past year. Officials were reviewing the system to see what went wrong.
More than 500firefighters were at the blaze Thursday, hoping to expand their containment line before hot and windy weather returns this weekend. The fire has blackened about 6 square miles in the mostly rural area southwest of Denver's populous suburbs. It was apparently sparked by a state-prescribed burn that was stirred up by strong winds on Monday.
Since then, 27 homes havebeen damaged or destroyed, an elderly couple was found dead at one of the homes and a woman whose house was destroyed remains missing.
Crews had built about 15percent of lines to secure the fire's 8.5-mile perimeter by Wednesday night. Kelley said that number would be much higher by the end of the day Thursday.
Two planes that drop fireretardant were diverted to a fire in South Dakota, but four Black Hawk helicopters from the Colorado Air National Guard were still dropping water on the blaze.
The bodies of 77-year-oldSam Lamar Lucas and 76-year-old Linda M. Lucas - known by some of her friends as Moaneti Lucas - were found at their home, which was destroyed by flames. Kelley said officials have determined that the couple received an evacuation call, but it was not clear when.
Kelley said it's not yet clear whether the missing woman received an evacuation notice.
Officials originally said 900 residences received automated evacuation notices.
Kelley said residents should evacuate whenever they feel in danger.
"You do not have to wait for the sheriff's office to tell you to evacuate," she said.
