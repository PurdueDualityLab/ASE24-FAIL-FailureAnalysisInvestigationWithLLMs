National Savings and Investments warned today that 8,000 of its customers had not received interest payments so far this month due to a technical glitch.
The Government-backed group said the fault meant that payments which should have been made to certain Income Bond holders on January 5 had not yet gone through.
It said it was "deploying all necessary measures" to resolve the issue, adding that it was writing to all affected customers telling them it would pay the outstanding interest as soon as possible.
The group said it was also working to ensure people received their February payment on time, while it would be paying compensation to people who suffered a delay this month, as well as covering any bank charges they incurred as a result of the problem.
Income bonds are typically taken out by people who want to use their savings to generate a regular income, and the products are particularly popular with pensioners.
The bonds are currently offering interest of up to 2% a year, with the returns paid to people in monthly instalments.
NS&I said the problem only affected people who bought the bonds between November 24 and November 28 every year up to 2009. It said only around 3% of all its Income Bond customers had been hit by the glitch.
The group stressed that no other income bond holders or customers with other products had been affected by the problem.
Steve Owen, channel director of NS&I, said: "We know that the delay in income payments will be an inconvenience to our customers and we apologise profusely for this.
"We are working to rectify the problem, and hope to be able to make January's income payments as soon as possible. We will provide a further update once we have the date of payment confirmed."
