SAVINGS Around 8,000 National Savings and Investments (NS&I) customers have not received interest payments this month because of a technical glitch, the Government-backed savings bank announced yesterday. The fault meant that interest payments which should have been made to certain Income Bond holders on 5 January had not yet gone through. A spokesman for NS&I said it was 'deploying all necessary measures' to resolve the issue, adding that it was writing to all affected customers telling them it would now pay the outstanding interest as soon as possible.
