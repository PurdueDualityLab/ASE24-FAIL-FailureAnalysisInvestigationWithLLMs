Around 8,000 National Savings and Investments customers who did not receive their January interest payments will have to wait a full month before they get the money, it was announced today.
The Government-backed group said the majority of Income Bond holders who were not paid interest on January 5 due to a technical problem would receive the money on February 5.
NS&I said it would be paying additional interest on the amount these customers were owed of 0.67%, the equivalent to a rate of 8% a year, while it would also refund any bank charges customers had incurred as a result of the delay.
The group reassured customers their February interest payment would be paid on time.
Income bonds are typically taken out by people who want to use their savings to generate a regular income, and the products are particularly popular with pensioners.
The bonds are currently offering interest of up to 2% a year, with the returns paid to people in monthly instalments.
But the group stressed the average income payment people affected by the problem were due was just £20, while for 62% of people it was less than £10, and only 7% of customers were owed £100 or more.
It added that it was making manual payments to people who were most reliant on the money for income, to ensure they were paid more quickly.
NS&I said the problem only affected people who bought the bonds between November 24 and November 28 every year up to 2009. It said only around 3% of all its Income Bond customers had been hit by the glitch.
No other income bond holders or customers with other products have been affected by the problem.
An NS&I spokesman said: "We have written to all customers affected by this issue to apologise, to reassure them that their investments are safe, and to let them know when their outstanding income payment will be paid.
"NS&I will also be paying all of these customers additional interest on the amount they are owed, based on an annual rate of 8% gross, calculated daily.
"Additionally, customers who incur bank charges as a direct consequence of this delay will be refunded."
