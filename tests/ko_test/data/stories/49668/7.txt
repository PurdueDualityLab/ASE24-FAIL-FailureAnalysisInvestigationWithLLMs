NATIONAL Savings and Investments warned that 8,000 of its customers had not received interest payments so far this month due to a technical glitch.
The Government-backed group said the fault meant payments, which should have been made to certain Income Bond holders on January 5, had not yet gone through.
It said it was "deploying all necessary measures" to resolve the issue.
