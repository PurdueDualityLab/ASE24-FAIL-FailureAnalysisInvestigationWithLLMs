NATIONAL Savings and Investments warned that 8,000 of its customers had not received interest payments so far this month due to a technical glitch. The Government-backed group said the fault meant that payments which should have been made to certain Income Bond holders on January 5 had not yet gone through. It said it was "deploying all necessary measures" to resolve the issue.
