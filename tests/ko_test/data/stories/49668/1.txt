National Savings and Investments (NS&I) is writing to around 8,000 customers to explain why they have yet to receive interest payments from their income bonds, after a technical fault caused a delay in the payments.
The Treasury-backed savings product provider said bond customers should have received their income payments on 5 January, but the glitch - which is still not fixed - has prevented the cash being paid out.
Customers affected are those who bought their bonds during a five-day period running between 24 to 28 November every year up to 2009.
NS&I's channel director, Steve Owen, has apologised for the hold-up. He said: 'We know that the delay in income payments will be an inconvenience to our customers and we apologise profusely for this.
'We are working to rectify the problem, and hope to be able to make January's income payments as soon as possible.'
The delay - which in total has impacted around 3% of income bond customers - does not affect any other NS&I products.
