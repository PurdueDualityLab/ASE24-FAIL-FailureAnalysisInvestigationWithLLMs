National Savings and Investments warned yesterday that 8,000 of its customers had not received interest payments so far this month due to a technical glitch.
The government-backed group said the fault meant that payments which should have been made to certain income bond holders on January 5 had not yet gone through.
It said it was "deploying all necessary measures" to resolve the issue, adding that it was writing to all affected customers.
The group said it was also working to ensure people received their February payment on time, while it would be paying compensation to people who suffered a delay this month, as well as covering any bank charges they incurred as a result of the problem.
Income bonds are typically taken out by people who want to use their savings to generate a regular income, and the products are particularly popular with pensioners.
The bonds offer interest of up to 2 per cent per year, with the returns paid monthly.
NS&I said the problem only affected people who bought the bonds between November 24 and November 28 every year up to 2009.
