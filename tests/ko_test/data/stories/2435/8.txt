TRYING to sort out pay problems has so far cost relief teacher Andrea Adams Gibson a day off work and about 10 hours on the telephone.
Yesterday, a week after a computer fault delayed pay for about 67,000 school staff, Ms Adams Gibson said the Education Ministry's new payroll company, Datacom, could not tell her if she would be paid next Wednesday.
"I've had to turn down a day's work today to try to sort it out, and I've had to extend my overdraft."
As she had not been paid properly for six weeks, and was paying 20.5 per cent interest on her overdraft, she expected compensation for her time and expenses, she said. Last week she was "advanced" $650 of the $1250, plus travel expenses, she was owed.
She said that on Monday last week she asked Datacom for a pay slip and details of the rate at which her pay had been calculated. The information was not sent and she was referred to the Education Ministry.
On Tuesday, she faxed the details to the ministry. On Wednesday, she went to Datacom, to be told her card and faxes she had sent had been lost. She found out the scale she had been paid on was incorrect.
When she asked for the money she was owed to be paid into her account as soon as possible staff were unsympathetic, she said.
Datacom marketing director Graham Hendry said he was surprised to learn of her difficulties. It was unsatisfactory that she had to take time off work but he could not say how Datacom would respond to an expenses claim. "We would have to look at each situation on its merits."
Educational Institute assistant national secretary Joanna Beresford said the union was still getting complaints about pay problems.
