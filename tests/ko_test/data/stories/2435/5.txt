Computer glitch leaves teachers without pay

A COMPUTER glitch left 67,000 teachers and school staff without their pay yesterday.
Datacom Employer Services, the company contracted to process teachers' pay, bungled the $ 73 million transfer, which was the first to use new computer software since the company began processing the education payroll in July.
Datacom said yesterday the problem occurred in the final transfer of data to the banking system.
Marketing director Graham Hendry said Datacom was the oldest and biggest New Zealand-owned computer services company.
Datacom had a five-year contract to process the education payroll -- the largest payroll job in New Zealand.
The effects of the mix-up were felt by teachers and other staff throughout the country.
A teacher had her car confiscated by a service station when funds to pay for petrol were denied by eftpos, the New Zealand Educational Institute said.
Education Ministry spokesman Michael Deaker said a Datacom computer tape was unable to accept the amount of data placed on it.
'We intensely regret it -- this was the first full run -- it's very very frustrating,' Mr Deaker said.
The decision to change to a payroll contractor was necessary because the ministry's in-house payroll service was antiquated, Mr Deaker said.
'Datacom has replaced what was a very old-fashioned payroll system relying on cardboard computer punch cards.'
The ministry had apologised to teachers in writing and had asked banks to operate teachers' accounts as if they had been paid.
Datacom has agreed to pay any penalties suffered as a result of the failure and has assured teachers their pay would go through last night.
The Post Primary Teachers Association, which this week hopes to negotiate a new teachers' pay deal with the Government, wasted no time condemning the ministry yesterday.
President Martin Cooney said it was unfortunate the incident occurred in the week that Education Minister Wyatt Creech had spoken out about improvements to the quality of education.
