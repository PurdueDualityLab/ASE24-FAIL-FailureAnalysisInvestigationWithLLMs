Teachers paid, but some out of pocket

The $ 73 million teacher payroll finally went through today, 24 hours late, but glitches in the new system have left some out of pocket.
Education secretary Howard Fancy said Datacom would consider reimbursing teachers who suffered financial penalties because of the foulups.
Ministry of Education spokesman Michael Deaker said staff still owed pay should contact the Ministry to arrange an advance.
Since July 1, Datacom has been doing the payroll under contract.
Mr Deaker said the Ministry was closely monitoring Datacom's performance and if problems continued 'the contract will have to be reviewed'.
Contracting out cut payroll costs by 12 percent, Mr Deaker said.
The five-year contract was worth about $ 480,000 a month.
Since the ministry contracted out the payroll to Datacom six weeks ago, many teachers and school support staff have not been paid, or wrongly paid. Some have had to borrow to cover living expenses.
Education Institute executive officer Karen Whibley said Datacom and the Ministry had a responsibility to reimburse staff who suffered financial loss because of payroll problems.
'We are seeking a meeting with them both today,' she said.
The Post spoke to one Hutt Valley teacher who was in dire straits after being underpaid $ 2200.
Today $ 1700 of that appeared in her bank account, indicating she is still being paid at the wrong rate.
Meantime, the teacher said she had been forced to double her credit card limit to $ 4000 to pay living expenses.
'I've had to use all of it. Who's going to pay the 20 percent interest?'
Datacom director George Tuffin said the problems were 'tragic'.
'We know how much trouble it caused.'
The pay foulups have affected mostly relieving and part-time teachers, those appointed to new positions and support staff.
But yesterday 'human error' was blamed for all the country's 67,000 school staff not getting their pay on time. Teachers discovered their money machine and Eftpos transactions were declined.
This week's payroll was also meant to reimburse 80 percent of back pay owed to school staff affected by the foulups.
In some cases teachers have been overpaid. St Patrick's College part-time teacher Ian Logan said he was overpaid for several weeks. Datacom asked him to arrange repayments.
'I banked my next pay cheque on (Monday) July 29. On the Friday evening, I got a cancellation notice. Datacom had cancelled it without telling me.'
The school advanced him the money and took up the issue. Datacom has since apologised. The issue is still being sorted out.
Post Primary Teachers Association president Martin Cooney said the foulups with the contracting out were a huge loss of face.
'On the first day of the new system, it just collapsed. When our pay increase goes through, how is it going to cope with the complexity of that?' he said.
