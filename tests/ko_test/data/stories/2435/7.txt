THE computer company that failed to pay 67,000 teachers and school staff on Wednesday was still unsure yesterday if all workers had their money.
A computer glitch at Datacom Employer Services delayed pay for most teachers by 24 hours but some part-time teachers and other staff were still without their money yesterday, Carol Parker of the New Zealand Educational Institute said.
'The problem now is that so many got incorrect pay -- we're still getting calls from people affected by this.'
Datacom Group director George Tuffin said all teachers should have been paid but some of the problems 'had a long tail'.
A special unit had been set up to deal with relief teachers' pay, which, some teachers said, was up to six weeks late.
Meanwhile, Education Minister Wyatt Creech has ordered the secretary of education to investigate the pay failure.
'I am deeply concerned by problems with the payments. A speedy inquiry is needed to find out what went wrong and to establish what needs to be done to ensure the collapse is never repeated,' he said.
