Pay delay annoys educators

TEACHERS and school staff were not paid yesterday and their union is furious.
New Zealand Educational Institute acting national secretary Joanne Beresford said that since the Ministry of Education contracted the payroll service to Datacom Education Payroll on July 1, pay problems had plagued educators.
'It's an outrageous shambles,' she said.
NZEI Taranaki branch president Alan Taylor said the mistake was tragic for some staff.
'If Datacom cannot deliver the service, it should not be doing its job,' Mr Taylor said. 'In our 21/2 years with New Zealand Payroll we never had a situation like this.'
Secretary for Education Howard Fancy said 67,000 teachers and school staff missed out on their pay because of a 'glitch' by Datacom.
Datacom had assured the ministry teachers would have their pay today, but they were seeking independent confirmation, Mr Fancy said.
Boards were asked to help out teachers short on funds, banks had been asked to operate accounts as if the pay was there and Datacom would consider refunding costs.
