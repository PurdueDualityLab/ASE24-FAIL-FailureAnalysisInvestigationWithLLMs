A private shambles

After a decade of soothing noises from private-is-best theorists, it will come as a surprise to disciples that a sophisticated company with all the latest whizzbang machines fell flat on its face with its new contract to deliver the State education payroll.
Problems with a new pay system run by contractor Datacom came to a head this week when the salaries of 67,000 staff - teachers, aides, cleaners, relievers and administration workers - were delayed. Some were overpaid, and some not paid at all. It's been a shambles.
Since July 1, Datacom has been contracted by the Ministry of Education to do its massive payroll for five years at $ 480,000 a month, excluding add-ons for such items as fluctuations in staff numbers and relievers. By its own account the Ministry of Education is saving around 12 percent on payroll costs by going to a contract system, but any more of this sputter-and-bust nonsense and the Ministry will be wondering if the exercise has been worthwhile. The Education Ministry's methods worked with barely a hiccup across decades from pen and pencil entries to computerisation, only to be replaced by private smart-tech systems which failed on liftoff. The Ministry says if Datacom's problems continue, the contract will have to be reviewed. In the circumstances, it seems the sensible thing to do.
Reasons for the glitch vary. The company's unit manager for the payroll job says there has been a lack of staff to deal with the thousands of timesheets which need to be processed, a position at odds with that of the marketing director, who says it was not a staff problem, but a problem with computer tape. The reasons, of course, don't matter to the educators and ancillary staff on New Zealand's largest payroll. They want service, and that means money in their accounts when their employer promises it. This week some have been obliged to borrow, others to seek credit; some have been bailed out when schools themselves gave an advance on wages.
It's been a headache for all concerned - the earners, the Ministry, and Datacom. And Education Minister Wyatt Creech, who has New Zealand's longest-running industrial dispute of recent years to deal with, could do without the diversionary heat caused by a contractor's failure. He wants an investigation. He should be certain when he sees results that they and other transaction services the company supplies are also remedied.
Datacom is understandably mortified. Having expressed confidence in its ability to provide a service before it was awarded the payroll contract, it will be working quickly to avoid repetition of failure. To its credit, the company has said it will consider reimbursement for education workers stung by additional bank charges and loan interest resulting from its shambles.
Privatisation in itself is no bad thing. By now, however, State agencies should be smart enough to determine if contractors have reliable mechanisms and can deliver the goods. There seems little point in advancing lucrative contracts to the private sector when they cannot match the standards the State itself provided.
