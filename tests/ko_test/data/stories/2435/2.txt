Pay glitch not over for relievers

COMPUTER problems that delayed pay for about 67,000 school staff continued to affect some relief teachers yesterday.
Despite assurances from Datacom Employer Services that all teachers and support staff would be paid by yesterday some were not paid and others were underpaid.
Heather Armishaw, a relief teacher at Hutt Valley High, said her pay was five weeks late. Only $ 136 of the $ 800 she expected was deposited and $ 250 was deducted for an advance she had not asked for or received. Other relievers had experienced similar problems.
A colleague should have been paid $ 280 but received only $ 35 and 'had to go cap in hand to the bank today', she said.
Primary school reliever Andrea Gibson said she had not been paid for 121/2 days and was owed $ 1250 plus travel expenses. 'It's been a nightmare. I'm $ 400 behind with my rent . . . and I'm angry.'
Ms Gibson said she was told she had sent in her payslips late. She did not accept they were late but even if they were late Datacom was late, too, and should correct it.
Yesterday she was told she would be paid $ 650. 'I don't know how they worked that out, and they couldn't even tell me what rate I was being paid.'
Education Minister Wyatt Creech said he was deeply concerned and had asked for an investigation into what went wrong.
The company, contracted by the Education Ministry to process the payroll, New Zealand's largest, from July 1, said $ 73 million owing to staff went into bank accounts about 10pm on Wednesday.
Marketing director Graham Hendry said the company would consider reimbursing financial penalties suffered by people who had to go into overdraft or increase their bank card limits.
Pay should have been available from early on Wednesday but because the computer problem that stopped the transfer had been corrected the same day, no interest penalty would be incurred, he said.
Ministry spokesman Michael Deaker said a payroll issues survey had been sent to every school and most errors would have been corrected.
Those still underpaid should contact their service centre or Louis McLaughlin at the ministry.
Urgent advances were being made and the ministry still believed it had been right to contract payroll services because its old system was overloaded, inflexible and more manual.
