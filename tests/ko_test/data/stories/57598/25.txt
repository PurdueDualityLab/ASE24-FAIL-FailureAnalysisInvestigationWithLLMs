Talk about missing by a mile. Consensus estimates for November's index of industrial production (IIP) put output growth at 2.2 per cent. It came in at 5.9 per cent, which shocked everybody. The most bearish estimate - that of Leif Eskesen, HSBC's chief economist for South Asia - was a negative 2.4 per cent; the most optimistic was that of Care Ratings' chief economist Madan Sabnavis at 5.6 per cent.
Some government officials welcomed it, but ; as a reversal of direction, others - including chief economic advisor Kaushik Basu - were a little circumspect. Compared to the October IIP output decline of 4.7 per cent (revised upwards from a contraction of 5.1 per cent), this jump of nearly 10 per cent warrants a little caution.
Some numbers appear at odds with corollary data. For instance, HSBC's PMI (purchasing managers index) for November suggested a slight fall. The outperformance seems way off; manufacturing grew by a strong 6.6 per cent, electricity by 14.1 per cent. Mining contracted 4.4 per cent on a yearly basis, but grew month on month, by 4.2 per cent.
Consumption showed robust growth, both consumer durables (11.2 per cent), and non-durables (14.8 per cent). Capital goods and basic goods also showed improvements. Seventeen out of the 22 industry goods in the index showed positive growth. How do we explain this extraordinary performance?
'Some of the consumer durables growth could be from inventory restocking after the Diwali holiday sales,' says Indranil Pan, chief economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank in Mumbai.
'To achieve a 5 per cent growth in the IIP, manufacturing will have to grow at 8 per cent at least for the duration of the current quarter; and we all know that is very unlikely in the current situation,' says Sabnavis.
The high November numbers could stem from a reporting glitch; Diwali - when spending is highest, and thus output that must match the demand - was at the end of October, rather than at the beginning of November as is the case in most years. So many factories that are closed during Diwali report an upsurge in November - the so-called technical bounce.
But if you took the average for October and November, it would just be 0.6 per cent, year-on-year. That is so much less than the 3.6 per cent IIP growth that prevailed in the July to September 2011 quarter. Even the 3-month moving average suggests that underlying trend in IIP growth remains weak. So before you begin celebrating, take a deep breath.
Taken together with the news on the decline in inflation, the indications of a trend reversal in output growth has many thinking whether the Reserve Bank of India will move out of pause mode and into active gear.
