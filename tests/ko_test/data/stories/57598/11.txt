TOKYO, Feb. 2 -- TheTokyo Stock Exchange said Thursday it halted the trading of 241 issues or about 10 percent of all issues listed on the bourse in morning trading due to a server glitch in its market data distribution system, adding it is investigating the cause.
The bourse resumedtrading of the issues at 12:30 p.m. after fixing the system. It will hold a news conference later in the day on the system failure.
Trading in the 241issues, including exchange-traded funds and real estate investment trusts, was suspended from the opening of the market at 9 a.m. Of the affected issues, 153, such as Sony Corp., Tokyo Electric Power Co. and Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co., are listed on the First Section of the TSE. There are a total of 2,459 issues listed on the bourse.
Financial Services Minister Shozaburo Jimi called on the Tokyo bourse to take steps to ensure the problem didn't happen again.
''It is regrettable. We want the TSE to find out the cause and prevent a recurrence.''
Although some brokerssaid the impact of the suspension on the overall market has been limited, some investors expressed anxiety since the system failure affected trading for major firms.
An investor said the credibility of the bourse will be questioned if orders are not implemented properly.
The 225-issue NikkeiStock Average and the broader Topix index were calculated in the morning using the closing prices on Wednesday of the affected issues.
It is the first time thatthe bourse's high-speed trading system, called Arrowhead, has suffered system trouble since its launch in January 2010.
Chief Cabinet SecretaryOsamu Fujimura said, ''The government will work with the Financial Services Agency and the TSE and closely monitor the situation.''
The bourse last suffered alarge-scale suspension of trading in January 2006, when it faced massive sell orders exceeding computer capacity after Livedoor Co. was raided by prosecutors over an accounting fraud.
Also in 2005, defects inthe trading system led then TSE chief Takuo Tsurushima to resign as Mizuho Securities Co. could not cancel erroneous sell orders of J-Com Co.
Meanwhile, the SapporoSecurities Exchange said it temporarily halted trading for all 74 issues in the morning, as the Sapporo bourse uses the same system as the Tokyo bourse.
