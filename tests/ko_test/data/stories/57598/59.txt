Tokyo, Feb. 16 (Jiji Press)--Tokyo Stock Exchange Inc.said Thursday it will cut executive pay for one month to take responsibility for the system failure and ensuing trading suspension that occurred earlier this month.
The operator of Japan'slargest stock exchange concluded that the incident should be blamed not only on the troubled server itself but also on exchange staff who failed to check the troubled server at an early stage because they overestimated the reliability of the system.
TSE said it has made itmandatory for staff to report potential threats to trading immediately rather than when such risks become apparent.
Other measures to preventa repeat of the system failure include increasing staff numbers during the early morning hours, TSE said.
TSE will impose a 30 pctpay cut on company President Atsushi Saito, and 20 pct pay cuts on Representative Senior Managing Directors Hiroyuki Iwakuma and Yoshinori Suzuki and Executive Officer Yasuhiro Yoshida.
The glitch thathit a server in the exchange's data distribution system in the early hours of Feb. 2 left morning trading in about 10 pct of stocks and instruments listed suspended.
