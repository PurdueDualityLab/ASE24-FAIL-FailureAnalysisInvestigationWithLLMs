The government said Friday it has ordered the Tokyo Stock Exchange to report monthly on its efforts to prevent computer system problems, following a failure earlier this month that briefly suspended trading of some issues at the bourse.
'We need to strictly look into' work by the TSE, Financial Services Minister Shozaburo Jimi told reporters. If the exchange's response is insufficient, the government would step up its administrative procedures by issuing a business improvement order, he said.
The order for monthly reports, issued on Thursday, came after Tokyo Stock Exchange Group Inc. announced the same day a 30 percent salary cut for one month for President Atsushi Saito over the Feb. 2 system failure, which temporarily halted trading of 241 issues, or around 10 percent of all issues listed on the bourse.
