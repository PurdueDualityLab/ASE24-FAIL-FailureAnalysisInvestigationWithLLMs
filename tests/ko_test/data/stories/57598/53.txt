Tokyo, Feb. 3 (JijiPress)--Japanese Financial Services Minister Shozaburo Jimi said Friday he has ordered the Tokyo Stock Exchange to submit a report on a computer system glitch that affected trading in more than 200 stocks and other securities Thursday morning.
The Financial Services Agency will consider punishing the biggest Japanese stock exchange after examining the report.
FSA Commissioner Ryutaro Hatanaka summoned TSE President Atsushi Saito on Thursday and urged him to identify the cause of the glitch and devise measures to prevent similar problems, Jimi told a press conference.
Jimi said it is regrettable that trading in many securities was halted due to the glitch, adding that the government will take necessary steps rigorously in accordance with law.
Throughout Thursdaymorning, the TSE suspended trading in a total of 241 issues, including 222 stocks and 12 exchange-traded funds, because of a problem in a market data distribution system. Trading in the issues was restarted in the day's afternoon session.
On Friday, trading beganwithout any problem from the outset for all stocks and other securities listed on the exchange. The data distribution system now operates normally as the glitch-hit equipment was replaced, TSE officials said.
But the TSE has still been unable to determine the cause of the glitch, a spokesman at the exchange said.
