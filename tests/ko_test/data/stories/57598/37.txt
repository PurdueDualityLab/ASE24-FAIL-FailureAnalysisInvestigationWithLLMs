The Tokyo Stock Exchange says it has suspended trading in 241 securities, including Sony Corp. and Hitachi Ltd., due to a glitch in its electronic trading system.
The problem was not affecting other issues on the exchange, which handles nearly 2,500 stocks and other financial instruments, exchange officials said.
The Nikkei 225 index was up 68.73 points, or 0.8 percent, at 8,878.47 in midmorning trading.
Stock exchange officials said they discovered the problem before trading opened at 9 a.m. and technical staff are working to correct it.
