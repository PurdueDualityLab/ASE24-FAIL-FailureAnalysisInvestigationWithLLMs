TOKYO, Feb. 2 -- The Tokyo Stock Exchange said Thursday it halted the trading of 241 issues in morning trading due to a server glitch in its market data distribution system, adding it is investigating the cause.
The bourse resumed trading of the issues at 12:30 p.m. after fixing the system.
Trading in the 241issues, including exchange-traded funds and real estate investment trusts, was suspended from the opening of the market at 9 a.m. Of the affected issues, 153, such as Tokyo Electric Power Co. and Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co., are listed on the First Section of the TSE. There are a total of 2,459 issues listed on the bourse.
Financial ServicesMinister Shozaburo Jimi called on the Tokyo bourse to take steps to prevent a recurrence of a similar incident.
''It is regrettable. We want the TSE to find out the cause and prevent a recurrence.''
The 225-issue NikkeiStock Average and the broader Topix index were calculated in the morning using the closing prices on Wednesday of the affected issues.
It is the first time thatthe bourse's high-speed trading system, called arrowhead, has suffered system trouble since its launch in January 2010.
The bourse last suffered alarge-scale suspension of trading in January 2006, when a concentration of large-volume orders forced its system to stop.
Meanwhile, the SapporoSecurities Exchange said it temporarily halted trading for all 74 issues in the morning, as the Sapporo bourse uses the same system as the Tokyo bourse.
