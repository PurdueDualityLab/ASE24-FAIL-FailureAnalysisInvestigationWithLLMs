TOKYO: There is growing pressure on the Tokyo Stock Exchange to take measures to prevent a recurrence of the trading glitch on Thursday.
The president of the TSEwas summoned to the Financial Services Agency on Thursday to explain the system failure, which halted the trading of 241 stocks.
The trading glitch could have implications for its proposed merger with the Osaka Securities Exchange.
Thursday's computer system problem at the Tokyo Stock Exchange was a shock to the market.
Securities firms foundthat they could not trade in shares of companies that were in the centre of the news. The trading halt affected 241 issues, including shares of key names like Sony, Hitachi and Tokyo Electric Power.
It was the first major trading disruption on the world's third-largest exchange since it upgraded its system in early 2010.
The system, calledArrowhead, is regarded as one of the world's fastest - with trading capable of being conducted in less than a second.
Thursday's incident isnot good news for the proposed merger between the TSE and the Osaka Securities Exchange, which is expected to take place in January next year.
The two parties would need to integrate their different trading platforms.
The Japan Fair Trade Commission has asked for a second report on the tie-up.
Before upgrading to theArrowhead, there was a string of widespread disruptions to trading on the TSE - in 2005, 2006 and 2008 - all caused by computer problems.
After this major computer glitch, some analysts said the incident could impact TSE's credibility. The reason for the glitch is still not yet known and the Japanese government wants the stock exchange to investigate.
