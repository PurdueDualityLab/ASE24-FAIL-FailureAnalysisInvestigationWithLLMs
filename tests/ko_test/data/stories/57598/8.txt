Tokyo, Feb. 2 (JijiPress)--Stocks gained further ground on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Thursday, as investors took heart from rises in overseas markets after solid economic indicators, as well as from the yen's easing against the euro.
Trading in a total of 241stocks, convertible bonds, exchange-traded funds was suspended throughout the morning session, due to a glitch in the TSE's computer system for market information distribution service.
But the problem's impact on the entire market was limited, brokers said.
At the close, the225-issue Nikkei average was up 67.03 points, or 0.76 pct, at 8,876.82, extending its winning streak to a third session. On Wednesday, the key market gauge rose 7.28 points.

The Nikkei average briefly rose more than 80 points before paring the gains slightly.
Financial and auto issues attracted buying, helping the Nikkei's advance.
"Automakers' quarterlyearnings reports were not so good, but investors are turning their eyes to their earnings outlooks for the next year (through March 2013), while glancing sideways at the yen's exchange rates," said Hideyuki Suzuki, equity general manager at SBI Securities Co. The yen stayed near its three-month high against the dollar in Thursday's trading.
"In addition, a pickup in Japanese vehicle sales in North America has become clear in recent data," Suzuki added.
Explaining anotherpositive factor for the Tokyo market, Hiroichi Nishi, equity general manager at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., said, "Foreigners seem to remain net buyers (of Japanese stocks)."
Nishi also noted animprovement of technical indicators, with the Nikkei's 25-day moving average surpassing its 75-day moving average.
Winning issues outnumbered losers 933 to 591 in the TSE's first section, while 146 issues were unchanged.
Volume rose to 2,251 million shares from Wednesday's 2,150 million shares.
Brokerage house Nomurasurged 7.14 pct, while Daiwa was up 4.46 pct. Megabanks Sumitomo Mitsui, Mitsubishi UFJ and Mizuho all gained more than 2 pct.
Automakers Toyota and Honda posted hefty gains, as did telecommunications carrier Softbank and shipping company Mitsui O.S.K. Lines.
Among the Nikkeiaverage's component issues affected by the trading suspension, insurer Dai-ichi Life and construction machinery maker Komatsu gained ground, while Sony fell 2.64 pct.
Electronics maker Sharpnose-dived 15.92 pct to score a daily-limit loss, after projecting a record group net loss for the year to March in its revised earnings forecast released Wednesday. Industry peer Panasonic plunged 4.05 pct.
