Tokyo Stock Exchange president Atsushi Saito has had his pay docked, following a trading glitch earlier this month that knocked out an entire morning's trading session.
Mr Saito's pay will becut by 30 per cent for one month, the TSE said on Thursday, while three other executives will have a 20 per cent reduction.
The suspension oftransactions between 9am and 11.30am on February 2 - right in the middle of Japan's third-quarter results seasons - was the worst outage on the TSE in seven years. It led to lost business worth about Y50bn ($640m), or 5 per cent of a day's worth of deals, according to TSE estimates.
The TSE said the glitchwas caused by an overnight breakdown of a server in the data distribution system of Arrowhead, the exchange's trading platform introduced in 2010. Staff should have checked back-up systems more thoroughly, said spokesman Yoshimatsu Kazuhiko.
The outage led tocondemnation from executives at some of the 241 companies whose stocks were affected, and from traders frustrated by the inability to trade. The Japan Securities Dealers Association shut trading on alternative platforms SBI Japannext and Chi-X Japan, explaining that it wanted to avoid "confusion" in the market. "The timing was bad," said one adviser at a Tokyo-based hedge fund. "People were trying to get off strategies and put on strategies, but couldn't."
The TSE's public censureof its chief executive comes at a sensitive time for the bourse, as it is preparing to merge with its domestic rival, the Osaka Securities Exchange. A group of disaffected shareholders in the OSE has challenged management to improve the terms of the deal. They believe that the merger ratio, valuing Tokyo at about 1.7 times Osaka, is too generous to the TSE.
The rebellion threatens atie-up that would create the world's third-biggest exchange group by market capitalisation of listed companies, after NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX.
It is not the first timethat Mr Saito has had his monthly pay cut after problems with trading infrastructure. In February 2008 the president suffered a 10 per cent cut following the failure of a recently-installed derivatives platform that shut down trading for an afternoon's session.
The TSE is stillembroiled in a High Court dispute with Mizuho Securities over a trading error in December 2005, when a mistyped sell order caused a loss of Y40bn for Mizuho. That incident, combined with a total trading shutdown a month earlier, led to the resignation of then-president Takuo Tsurushima.
