TOKYO (Dow Jones)--TheTokyo Stock Exchange said Thursday that the bourse's president will take a 30% salary cut in March for one month after a system glitch that caused trading of 241 issues to be halted during the morning session in early February.
The exchange has said thetwo-and-a-half hour halt on Feb. 2 was caused by a problem at one of the eight servers the TSE uses for stock data distribution.
The bourse also said it will improve its framework to cope with system glitches by the end of this month.
