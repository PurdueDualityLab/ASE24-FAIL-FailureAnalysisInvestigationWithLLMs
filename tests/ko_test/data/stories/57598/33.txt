TOKYO (NQN)--Tokyo stocks opened higher on Thursday, with the Nikkei Stock Average starting the day at 8,865, up 55 points.
The Tokyo Stock Exchangesuspended trading of 241 stocks before the bell, following the failure of a key information distribution system. Due to this glitch, the Wednesday closing prices for the 241 issues, including key Nikkei 225 stocks such as Komatsu Ltd. (6301), are being used to calculate the Nikkei average.
Overnight gains inforeign markets supported early sentiment in Tokyo, as did the release of positive U.S. and European economic data. Investors sought automakers such as Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) and Honda Motor Co. (7267) after they released strong U.S. sales figures for January. Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) also rose sharply.
Sharp Corp.(6753) opened ask-only, meanwhile, a day after the consumer electronics manufacturer said it will likely book a significant net loss for the fiscal year through March 2012.
