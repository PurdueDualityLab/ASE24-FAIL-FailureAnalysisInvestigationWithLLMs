System trouble at theTokyo Stock Exchange halted trading of 241 stocks during the morning session of Feb. 2, exposing a glaring lapse in risk management at the world's third-largest bourse on a trading-level basis.
In fact, system malfunctions are not rare at the TSE. The exchange's information distribution system experiences a glitch"about once every six months," Hiroaki Uji, who heads the section in charge of the TSE's stock trading system, told a news conference.
These minor disruptionshave not caused havoc, at least not before last week, because a backup system would take over within seconds. The TSE has yet to determine why the backup system did not come to the rescue this time.
To be fair, stock exchanges in other countries also suffer from system glitches.
NYSE Euronext Inc., whichoperates the New York Stock Exchange and other bourses, experienced system trouble on five occasions last year. But most of the malfunctions were quickly fixed.
At the London Stock Exchange, trading was halted for roughly four hours last year.
But given the TSE's trackrecord, it is absolutely crucial for the exchange to stay on top of the problem and improve its risk management. Trading has ground to a complete halt at the bourse in the past due to system trouble.
Last week's incident came at a particularly bad time for two reasons.
Impact
For starters, the TSE isin the midst of an increasingly intense worldwide competition among stock exchanges to court investors and businesses.
If the TSE's tradingsystem comes to be seen as problematic, the reputation would put the exchange at a serious disadvantage against Chinese bourses.
The total marketcapitalization of China's three major stock exchanges already exceeds that of the TSE by 70%. Chinese bourses have also started attracting foreign companies. U.S. luxury bag maker Coach Inc. listed its stock on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange last year.
Among Japanese companies, Lawson Inc. is preparing to list on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
The system failure wasalso unfortunate because the market is finally on a recovery track. After declining 17% last year, all the way down to where it was in 1983, the Nikkei Stock Average has gained roughly 5% so far in 2012.
But last week's system problem could dampen sentiment among global investors.
The TSE must quicklydetermine the cause of the trouble and implement measures to prevent a recurrence. If the bourse fails to do so, the bug's impact could last far longer than the half day for which trading was suspended.
