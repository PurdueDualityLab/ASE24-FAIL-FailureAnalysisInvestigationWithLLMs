TOKYO (Nikkei)--Systemtrouble halted trading of 241 stocks Thursday morning at the Tokyo Stock Exchange, exposing a glaring lapse in risk management at the world's third largest bourse.
In fact, a system malfunction is not a rare occurrence at the TSE. Its information distribution system experiences a glitch"about once every six months," Hiroaki Uji, who heads the section in charge of the TSE's stock trading system, told a Thursday news conference.
These minor disruptionsdid not cause havoc in the past because a backup system took over within seconds. The TSE has yet to determine why the switchover to a backup did not happen this time.
To be fair, stock exchanges in other countries are not immune to system glitches either.
NYSE Euronext Inc.,which operates the New York Stock Exchange and other bourses, experienced system trouble on five separate occasions last year. But most of them were resolved quickly.
At the London Stock Exchange, trading was halted for roughly four hours last year.
But given the TSE's trackrecord, it is absolutely crucial for the exchange to stay on top of the problem and improve its risk management. Trading has ground to a complete halt at the bourse in the past due to system trouble.
The incident on Thursday came at a particularly bad time for two reasons.
For starters, the troublecould hurt the TSE's standing in the world at a time when competition is heating up among stock exchanges trying to court investors and businesses.
If the TSE's tradingsystem is come to be seen as problematic, it would put the exchange at a serious disadvantage against Chinese bourses.
The total marketcapitalization of the three major Chinese stock exchanges already exceeds that of the TSE by 70%. Chinese bourses have also started attracting foreign companies. U.S. bag maker Coach Inc. listed its stock on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange last year. Among Japanese companies, Lawson Inc. (2651) is preparing to list on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
The system failure was unfortunate also because the market is finally on a recovery track.
After declining 17% lastyear to where it was in 1983, the Nikkei Stock Average has gained roughly 5% so far in 2012. But the system problem on Thursday could dampen sentiment among global investors.
The TSE must quicklydetermine the cause of the trouble and implement measures to prevent a recurrence. If the bourse fails to do so, its impact could last far longer than the half day that trading was suspended.
