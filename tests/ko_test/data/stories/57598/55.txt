TOKYO (Nikkei)--The furor over the suspension of proprietary trading systems during the system glitchat Japan's main established bourse earlier this month is expected to lead to rule changes that would keep them online as an alternative for investors seeking trades.
On the morning of Feb. 2,the Tokyo Stock Exchange halted trading of 241 issues after a price information distribution system broke down. Shortly afterward, the Japan Securities Dealers Association asked member brokerages to suspend off-board trading, including proprietary trading systems, for these securities.
But normal trading wasbeing conducted on bourses other than the TSE and the Sapporo Securities Exchange that day. For example, shares in Sony Corp. (6758), which are listed in both Tokyo and Osaka, could be traded on the Osaka Securities Exchange.
Investors at home andabroad, including hedge funds, blasted the JSDA for halting proprietary trading just because the Tokyo exchange had suspended trading.
The association plans todraw up new guidelines stating that in principle, off-board trading should remain online when a bourse suffers a system glitch. It hopes to reach a consensus with industry players by the end of March and put the new rules into effect that month or April.
In the U.S. and Europe,off-board trading serves as an alternative market when problems force bourses to stop trading, according to Sadakazu Osaki, head researcher at the Nomura Research Institute (4307).
While the value ofproprietary trading in Japan quadrupled on the year to about 13 trillion yen in 2011, such platforms are used mainly by institutional investors. Some argue that investors lacking access to such systems could be at a disadvantage if new rules keep proprietary trading online when trading on conventional bourses comes to a halt.
