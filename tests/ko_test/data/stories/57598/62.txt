The Tokyo Stock Exchange says it has restarted trading in 241 securities that had been suspended during the morning session due to a glitch in its electronic trading system.
Stocks of Sony Corp. and Hitachi Ltd. were among those temporarily suspended Thursday.
The problem did not affect other issues on the exchange, which handles nearly 2,500 stocks and other financial instruments, exchange officials said.
The Nikkei 225 index was up 81.32 points, or 0.9 percent, at 8,891.11 in early afternoon trading.
