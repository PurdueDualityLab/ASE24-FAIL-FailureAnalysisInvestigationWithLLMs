Sony warned it would suffer a Y220bn ($2.9bn) net loss for the full year, a much larger deficit than it had previously forecast, as it embarks on an expensive restructuring of its unprofitable television business.
The Japanese group's new guidance for the financial year ending in March compares to an earlier loss estimate of Y90bn, and is more pessimistic than experts had expected. Industry analysts tracked by Bloomberg had been projecting a loss of Y147bn.
Thursday's downgrade reflects the cost of dissolving a TV panel-making joint venture between Sony and Samsung of South Korea, a move that Sony says will force it to book a non-cash impairment charge of Y66bn. Sony is also writing off TV production facilities in Japan and scaling back its sales targets.
The electronics and entertainment group announced on Wednesday that Kazuo Hirai, its 51-year-old deputy president, will take over as president and chief executive in April, confirming a widely anticipated change of leadership. Mr Hirai will take on most of the responsibilities currently held by Sir Howard Stringer, the Wales-born American who has been Sony's chief executive since 2005 and will stay on as chairman.
Like other Japanese manufacturers, Sony has been hurt by a steep rise in the yen's exchange rate, which has made its exports more expensive and reduced the value of profits it earns overseas when those profits are expressed in its home currency.
A weak global economy meanwhile has weighed on consumer demand, while two natural disasters have created additional problems by disrupting Asian supply chains: Japan's earthquake and tsunami last March and widespread flooding in Thailand in the second half of the year.
Sony's share price fell by 54 per cent last year and Moody's cut its credit rating in January. The stock fell 2.6 per cent on Thursday after trading resumed following a technical glitch that prevented trading in a number of stocks on the TSE, closing ahead of the results at Y1,328.
Sony had been forecasting a full-year net profit as recently as November, but instead is facing its fourth straight year in the red. For the third quarter to December, it booked a net loss of Y159bn.
