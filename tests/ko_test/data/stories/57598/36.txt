A server glitch Thursday forced the Tokyo Stock Exchange to halt temporarily its morning session trading of 241 issues, the exchange said.
The glitch, which was being investigated, occurred in the market data distribution system.
Trading of the 241 issues resumed at 12:30 p.m. after the problem was fixed, Kyodo News reported. Those affected by the trading halt included exchange-traded funds and real estate investment trusts.
A total of 2,459 issues are listed on the TSE.
'It is regrettable. We want the TSE to find out the cause and prevent a recurrence,' Financial Services Minister Shozaburo Jimi was quoted as saying.
It was the first time the exchange's high-speed trading system, called arrowhead, had experienced such a problem since it was launched in January 2010, the report said.
