Tokyo Tackles Trading Glitch

TOKYO--The Tokyo Stock Exchange's suspension of trading of 241 securities Thursday morning lasted 212 hours and was attributed to a computer problem.
The suspension, which included blue-chip stocks such as Sony Corp. and Hitachi Ltd., was the first major trading disruption at the world's third-largest exchange since it upgraded its dealing system in early 2010. An earlier series of embarrassing technical errors had forced the exchange to replace its outdated trading platform.
The halt, announced just before the market opened, affected 222 companies, a group that also included retailer Aeon Co. and Konica Minolta Holdings Inc. The trouble hit other instruments, too, including exchange-traded funds, real-estate investment trusts and convertible bonds. Overall, about 10% of the exchange's 2,459 listed securities were affected.
A problem at one of the eight servers the TSE uses to distribute stock data was to blame, the exchange said.
"If I describe the cause of the trouble in simple terms, a switching of servers didn't take place properly following a hardware problem at the information-distribution system at our bourse," said Hiroaki Uji, who is in charge of information-technology development at the exchange. Employees were still investigating why the switching didn't take place, and it remains unclear why the first server failed, he said.
Trading in all the suspended shares resumed for the afternoon session. The Nikkei Stock Average closed up 0.8% at 8876.82 amid the third-heaviest trading volume of the year.
Some market analysts said the trouble may raise fresh concerns about the TSE's planned merger with rival Osaka Securities Exchange Co. in January 2013. One hurdle there is the integration of the different trading platforms.
Traders were given little time to warn clients, both before the market opened and the restart of trading. Moreover, the problem hit during the earnings season, a particularly active period for trading.
"Within a short time, my team scrambled to give multiple update announcements about the market data outage to many clients," said Michael Mollemans, head of advanced execution services for Japan at Credit Suisse Securities.
"It was definitely a frantic day," he said.
TSE President Atsushi Saito apologized for the glitch, saying steps have been taken to ensure smooth trading in the future.
"We will take all possible measures so trading will be carried out as normal from [Friday] onward," Mr. Saito said in a statement. "We offer our deepest apologies for the troubles caused to investors and many other market players."
Japan's Financial Services Agency, which oversees the stock exchange, said it would monitor the exchange's actions. "The exchange is a critical infrastructure for the marke,t and the FSA will continue to closely monitor the TSE's response," said Shozaburo Jimi, financial-services minister.
It was the first major system trouble for cash trading since the TSE installed its Arrowhead high-speed trading platform in 2010, which has had generally favorable reviews from the investment community. Before the upgrade, the TSE was dogged by a string of disruptions in 2005, 2006 and 2008 caused by computer problems.
The problems at the TSE aren't unique. Trading halts have periodically hit most of the world's major exchanges. In June 2011, a problem at the NYSE Euronext markets including Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels forced trading halts over a two-day period, while a September 2008 outage at the London Stock Exchange halted trading for more than seven hours.
