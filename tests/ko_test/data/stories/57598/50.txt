Wall Street also appeared headed for a higher opening, with Dow Jones industrial futures rising 0.1 percent to 12,671 while S&P 500 futures gained 0.1 percent to 1,321.30.
The gains followed a rally in Asia earlier in the day. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 rose 0.8 percent to 8,876.82 while Hong Kong's Hang Seng shot up 2 percent to 20,739.45 and Seoul's Kospi added 1.3 percent to 1,984.30.

And the Commerce Department said construction spending rose 1.5 percent in December, the fifth straight monthly gain.
Investors have also been cheered by growing optimism that contagion from a likely Greek debt default can be contained.
