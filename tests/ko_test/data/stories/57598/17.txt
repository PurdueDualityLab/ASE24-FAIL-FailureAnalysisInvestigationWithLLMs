Feb. 02--TOKYO -- Japanese shares rose Thursday morning led by carmakers after overnight gains on Wall Street and European markets, but the Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended trading of 241 stocks due to computer system errors.
The benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained 69.98 points, or 0.79 per cent, to 8,879.67 at the end of the morning session at 11:30 am (0230 GMT).
The broader Topix index was up 7.51 points, or 0.99 per cent, at 765.47.
The Tokyo bourse said it would resume trading of the suspended issues at 12:30 pm (0330 GMT).
Investors picked up undervalued shares in carmakers such as Toyota Motor Corp, Honda Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co. Toyota soared 2.77 per cent, Honda surged 2.84 per cent and Nissan rose 1.92 per cent.
Sharp Corp dived 15.45 per cent after the company said Wednesday it expected a record net loss of 290 billion yen (3.8 billion dollars) for the current financial year through March due to the yen's rise and slumping sales amid global economic problems.
A strong yen makes Japanese goods more expensive overseas and erodes repatriated earnings.
On currency markets at 11:30 am, the dollar traded at 76.12-14 yen, down from Wednesday's 5 pm quote of 76.18-20 yen.
The euro was quoted at 100.38-42 yen, up from 99.40-44 yen late Wednesday, and at 1.3186-3188 dollars, up from 1.3048-3050 dollars.
