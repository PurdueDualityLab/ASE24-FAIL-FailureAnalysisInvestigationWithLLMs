The Tokyo Stock Exchange was forced to suspend trading in the shares of 241 companies including blue-chips Sony and Hitachi for the whole of the morning session Thursday due to a computer glitch.
In the latestembarrassing system error to hit Asia's largest bourse by market capitalisation, the TSE suspended dealing in the affected shares -- Konica Minolta and Mitsubishi Electric also among them -- from its 0000 GMT opening.
Trading resumed when the afternoon session started at its normal time of 0330 GMT.
"The bourse is examiningthe cause of the system trouble, and we still don't know what led to the failure," an exchange spokeswoman said.
The computer glitch caused the failure of a server used to distribute stock data to investors, she said.
The Sapporo SecuritiesExchange, a regional bourse in northern Hokkaido, was also forced to stop trading as it is on the same system and all its 74 stocks were affected, a bourse official said.
It is the first major system trouble since the TSE installed a new high-speed trading platform, "Arrowhead", in January 2010.
In November 2005 theTokyo bourse was forced to suspend trading in all its shares for the first time ever because of a software problem.
The exchange was hit by anumber of computer system issues in the following years, raising concerns about the quality of its infrastructure.
