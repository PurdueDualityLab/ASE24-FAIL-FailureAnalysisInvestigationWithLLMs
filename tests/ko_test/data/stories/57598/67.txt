Tokyo, Feb. 16 (Jiji Press)--The situation surrounding the Tokyo Stock Exchange's computer system glitchearlier this month was aggravated due to the failure by its staff to confirm whether a backup system would work, the exchange said Thursday.
"There was a fundamentalproblem with the way the TSE manages its computer systems," Hiroaki Uji, chief of the exchange's stock trading system management, said at a news conference.
The problem includes the failure by the exchange's staff to look into systems by themselves, Uji said.
According to a report the TSE submitted to the Financial Services Agency, workers at Fujitsu Ltd. mistakenly concluded that a backup system would be able to work after a glitch hit a server in the exchange's trading data delivery system at 1:27 a.m. on Feb. 2 (4:27 p.m. on Feb. 1 GMT).
TSE workers, after receiving a report from Fujitsu, reached a conclusion at 2:44 a.m. that trading would not be affected by the glitch, a decision they made without confirming by themselves if things would go smoothly, the exchange's report said.
Even after the TSE found the data delivery system was not able to work at 7:38 a.m., it was as late as 8 a.m. that the glitch was reported to Yoshinori Suzuki, senior managing director in charge of computer systems, the exchange said.
As a result, the TSE failed to make an adequate response to the glitch, leaving morning trading in 241 stocks and instruments listed suspended.
The TSE unveiled measuresto prevent a repeat of such an incident, including requiring an immediate reporting to management when system glitches occur and beefing up inspections of backup systems.
Atsushi Saito, presidentof Tokyo Stock Exchange Inc., the operator of the exchange, will face a one-month pay cut of 30 pct to take responsibility, while Suzuki and two other executives will see their pay cut by 20 pct for one month.
Uji said the exchange has no plans to seek damages from Fujitsu.
