Stock exchanges ; Ben McLannahan explains why Tokyo and Osaka are joining forces
The union of Japan's largest exchange groups has been a long time coming. Years after big exchanges in other jurisdictions started combining, or at least trying to, Tokyo Stock Exchange and the Osaka Securities Exchange should merge into a single entity by 2013.
As TSE chief executive Atsushi Saito told the Nikkei newspaper in January: "The Japanese market needs to be of a certain size and offer unique services in order not to be left behind by global developments."
In theory at least, the merged company - tentatively named "Japan Exchange Group" - should be a more attractive place to do business than the TSE or OSE in isolation.
Tokyo will acquire a majority of the Osaka bourse, form a holding company, maintain the OSE's public listing and create four business units: cash equity market, futures trading, regulatory and clearing. That will give it both scale and solidity.
In equities, JEG should overtake the London Stock Exchange to become the world's third-largest market after NYSE Euro-next and Nasdaq, based on the total value of listings. In derivatives, Osaka has built an apparently cycle-proof business trading futures and options on the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average.
"You'd have to figure that this deal has more obvious benefits than a cross-border deal," says Lee Porter, Hong Kong-based head of Asia-Pacific at Liquidnet, operator of an off-exchange platform for institutions.
"If you're a broker with two sets of connectivity and two sets of relationships with two separate exchanges, removing one set will make your life cheaper and easier. And for the exchanges themselves, there have to be economies of scale, which should get passed on to users."
Analysts note that bigger synergies than the advertised Y7bn ($87m) a year look possible, given the history of other in-country deals between stock and derivatives groups, such as the merger of Australia's ASX and the Sydney Futures Exchange six years ago. And the deal could spur further domestic consolidation. The newly-merged JEG could go on to purchase the Tokyo Commodity Exchange and the Tokyo Grain Exchange, says Stephen Barker, an analyst at Credit Suisse.
Overseas, too, JEG could do deals. The transaction is, effectively, a backdoor listing for the TSE, giving the 134-year-old exchange a currency with which to enter the global exchange-acquisition game.
The big question, however, is whether JEG can win back influence on the global stage, after years of thumb-twiddling. The TSE was demutualised 11 years ago, converting from a not-for-profit association of stockbrokers into a for-profit public limited company: Osaka demutualised and listed in April 2004.
While other exchanges around the world have used that process as a catalyst to seek growth overseas, neither the TSE nor the OSE has done much outside Japan.
Take Tokyo AIM, a joint venture between the TSE (51 per cent) and the London Stock Exchange (49 per cent), targeted at fast growing companies. Three years on from its much-trumpeted launch, it has one listed company and one more pending.
Japan has lost ground in other ways, too. Only two non-Japanese companies have listed on the TSE since the beginning of 2010, for example. Now, just 11 of the 2,276 companies listed in Tokyo are foreign, from a peak of 127 in 1991.
By contrast, the number of foreign companies listed in Hong Kong has more than doubled to 24 in the past 10 years. "Offerings in Hong Kong can be expedited much better: the exchange turns things round much more quickly," says one head of equity capital markets in Tokyo.
Internally, too, the picture is not entirely encouraging. Along with many incumbent exchange groups around the world, the TSE and OSE are facing the threat of alternative trading platforms eating into their market share.
In 2011, the combined equity-trading shares of SBI Japannext and Chi-X, the two leading alternative domestic platforms, doubled to about 3 per cent. On some days, they account for about a fifth of trading in the most liquid and recognisable stocks.
Rivals point out that the playing field is not exactly level. For example, margin traders are banned from alternative venues altogether.
But regulatory protections for the main exchanges could be on their way out.
Following a technical glitch last month which halted trading in hundreds of TSE stocks, the Japan Securities Dealers Association is drawing up guidelines stating that in principle, off-board trading should remain online when a bourse suffers a system glitch.
The TSE and the OSE "see the writing on the wall", says Neil Katkov, a Tokyo-based financial consultant at Celent. "In the long run, they see the trend towards liquidity moving to other venues."
That should increase the pressure to seek growth overseas. In October 2010, remarking on merger discussions between Australia's ASX and Singapore's SGX (of which the TSE holds 5 per cent) Mr Saito warned of the consequences of Japan becoming "isolated on the international stage".
The reality is that, during the most recent rounds of talks between the world's leading exchange groups, the Japanese were largely bystanders.
Creating a bigger, leaner, more outward-looking JEG looks a step in the right direction.
