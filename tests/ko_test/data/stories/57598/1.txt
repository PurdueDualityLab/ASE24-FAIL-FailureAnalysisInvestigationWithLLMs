LOS ANGELES (MarketWatch) -- Japanese shares rose sharply out of the Thursday open, with banks and auto makers among the leading gainers, though trading in some blue-chip shares was suspended due to what reports said was a technical glitch. The Nikkei Stock Average (JP:NI225) moved 0.9% higher to 8,884.30, while the Topix also added 0.9% in early moves.
Toyota Motor Corp. (JP:7203) (TM) rose 2.7% after reporting a 7.5% gain in January U.S. sales, while Honda Motor Co. (jp:7267) (HMC) advanced 3% on a 9.3% U.S. sales increase. Financials were especially strong, with Nomura Holdings Inc. (JP:8604) (NRSCF) (NMR) climbing 6.8% after reporting late Wednesday that its quarterly profit grew by one-third. Among other banks, Daiwa Securities Group Inc. (JP:8601) (DSECF) rose 3.7%, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (jp:8306) (MTU) added 2%, and Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (JP:8411) (MFG) moved 2.6% higher. Meanwhile, the reported technical problems left many key shares untraded, including those of Sony Corp. (JP:6758) (SNE) , Hitachi Ltd. (JP:6501) (HIT) , and Aeon Co. (JP:8267) (AONNF) . There was no immediate word on when the problem would be resolved.
