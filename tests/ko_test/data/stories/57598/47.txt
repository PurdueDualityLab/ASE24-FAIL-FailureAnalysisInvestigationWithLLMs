TOKYO (Dow Jones)--Theabrupt suspension of trading at the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Thursday morning happened because a planned switch from a failed server to two backups didn't take place properly, a TSE official said later in the day.
"If I describe the causeof the trouble in simple terms, a switching of servers didn't take place properly following a hardware problem at the information distribution system at our bourse," said Hiroaki Uji, an official in charge of information technology development at the TSE.
He said workers are stillinvestigating why the switching didn't take place and that it remains unclear why the first server failed.
The value of tradingwould have been five percent higher if the system failure hadn't occurred, said Hironaga Miyama, another official in charge of market operations.
The temporary suspension of trading of 241 issues, including blue-chip stocks such as Sony Corp. (6758.TO) and Hitachi Ltd.(6501.TO), was the first major disruption in trading since the world's third-largest exchange upgraded its system in early 2010 after a series of embarrassing technical glitches forced the bourse to make massive investments to replace its antiquated trading platform.
