U.S. markets mixed
NEW YORK, Feb. 2 (UPI) -- U.S. markets were mixed Thursday after the Labor Department said first-time claims for unemployment benefits fell modestly last week.
The department said initial claims dropped by 12,000 to 367,000. The four-week rolling average of first-time claims fell by 2,000 to 375,750.
In early afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 2.15 points, 0.02 percent, to 12,714.31. The Standard & Poor's 500 index added 2.27 points, 0.17 percent, to 1,326.36. The Nasdaq composite index gained 12.89 points, 0.45 percent, to 2,861.16.
The 10-year treasury note fell 5/32 to yield 1.846 percent.
The euro fell to $1.3236 from Wednesday's $1.3161. Against the yen, the dollar fell to 76.17 yen from Wednesday's 76.20 yen.
In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 index gained 0.76 percent, 67.03, to 8,876.82.
forces temporary halt in trading
TOKYO, Feb. 1 (UPI) -- A server glitch Thursday forced the Tokyo Stock Exchange to halt temporarily its morning session trading of 241 issues, the exchange said.
The glitch, which was being investigated, occurred in the market data distribution system.
Trading of the 241 issues resumed at 12:30 p.m. after the problem was fixed, Kyodo News reported. Those affected by the trading halt included exchange-traded funds and real estate investment trusts.
A total of 2,459 issues are listed on the TSE.
'It is regrettable. We want the TSE to find out the cause and prevent a recurrence,' Financial Services Minister Shozaburo Jimi was quoted as saying.
It was the first time the exchange's high-speed trading system, called arrowhead, had experienced such a problem since it was launched in January 2010, the report said.
Job cuts spiked in January
CHICAGO, Feb. 2 (UPI) -- U.S. employers in January announced a reduction of 53,486 jobs, a 28 percent jump over layoffs announced in December, a private research group said.
The total for the month was also 39 percent higher than January 2011 and shows a labor market that is headed in two directions. While larger firms continue to streamline operations or send jobs overseas, smaller companies are hiring.
They are not necessarily hiring at a rate that will lower the unemployment rate, but private firms with fewer than 500 workers added 167,000 jobs in January, while those with more than 500 employees added 3,000.
In one of the latest downturns, AMR, parent of American Airlines, announced it would cut 13,000 jobs, a 20 percent across the board reduction. The announcement, made Wednesday, will count with February's layoff statistics, not January's.
Employment outplacement firm Challenger Gray & Christmas said Thursday that a spike in layoffs at the start of the year is 'not unusual.'
'Historically, January is the heaviest job-cut month, averaging 101,084 announced layoffs between 1993 and 2011,' the firm said.
Still, the spike this year is higher than the spike last year.
The firm said retailers and financial firms suffered the highest layoff toll for the month with 12,426 job cuts and 7,611 job cuts, respectively.
Thwarting a common misconception, the firm said retail layoffs do not include seasonal workers let go after the holidays. Typically, retail layoffs in January involve the loss of permanent jobs due to store closings and cost-cutting strategies.
Texas was hit hardest in the month with 11,606 jobs lost. Illinois was hit with a loss of 7,601 jobs. Third on the list, employers in North Carolina announced 5,980 layoffs in January.
Construction gains slow down in Britain
LONDON, Feb. 2 (UPI) -- The Purchasing Managers Index for the construction sector in Britain declined in January, the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply said Thursday.
The PMI, which indicates business growth with numbers above 50, dropped from 53.2 to 51.4, said the report, which is co-produced by Markit Economics.
At 51.4, construction expanded, but expansion slowed to the weakest level in four months.
Employment in the sector was stagnant, Markit said.
The new-orders index dragged down the composite index and two of three broad construction categories, housing and civil engineering, had declining output in January.
Commercial construction, however, expanded for the 23rd consecutive month, the report said.
