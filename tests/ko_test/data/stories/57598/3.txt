TOKYO (NQN)--Thesuspension of trade for 241 issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange due to a system failure Thursday morning was met with concern and disgruntlement by investors.
Because the suspended issues included blue chips, such as Sony Corp. (6758), Hitachi Ltd. (6501), Komatsu Ltd. (6301) and Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501), brokerages received a number of complaints from retail investors.
Investors were frustratedbecause trading opportunities were lost for Tepco and other issues that are normally traded heavily among individual investors.
Sony'sstock "had been expected to rise" on the news the previous day about a change in the electronics giant's presidency, said a Japanese fund manager.
"Whatever thecircumstances are, it is an exchange's obligation to provide trading opportunities," said an official at a domestic brokerage. "The system failure could undermine the bourse's credibility at a time when it faces a decline in power due to the widespread use of proprietary trading systems."
Some investors expressed concern about the impact of the glitch on the TSE's planned merger with the Osaka Securities Exchange.
