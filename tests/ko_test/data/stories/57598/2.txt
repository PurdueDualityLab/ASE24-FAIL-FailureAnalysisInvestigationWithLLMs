HONG KONG (MarketWatch) -- The Tokyo Stock Exchange said Thursday it had resolved a trading problem that resulted in the suspension of 241 securities and that normal trade would resume at 12.30 p.m., according to reports citing the exchange operator. The exchange said earlier that shares, including those of Sony Corp. (JP:6758) (SNE) and Hitachi Ltd. (JP:6501) (HIT) had been halted from 9.00 a.m. local time, owing to 'troubles on the market data/market information distribution.'
