Night-flight fears quashed as King Shaka takes off

Airport officials moved swiftly yesterday to quash rumours that the new King Shaka International Airport would not be able to handle night-time flights because of problems with air traffic controllers.
Hundreds of people made use of the new facility when it opened its doors to passengers and visitors for the first time yesterday. The first commercial flights departed and arrived to much fanfare at 6.30am and 8.02am respectively.
Some sight-seers, according to Airports Company South Africa (Acsa) spokesman Colin Naidoo, arrived at the airport before 5am to witness and take pictures of the airport's first day, much like a child's first day at school.
But the opening of the airport was not without some controversy.
Media reports late in the week indicated that night flights would not be possible at the new facility because none of the controllers were trained specifically for the airspace at the airport.
But in a joint statement, Acsa and the Air Traffic and Navigation Services company said this was untrue, and that all flights would be accommodated at King Shaka according to the same schedule that was used at the Durban International Airport. Essentially, this means the last flights are likely to take off shortly after 9pm and land at about 10pm.
'It is not true that the airport will not be able to accommodate night flights. There is no need to cancel flights as the airport will be operating to the exact same schedule as the one that was in place at the old Durban International Airport,' the statement said, referring to comments made that several flights had to be cancelled.
However, the organisations admitted that the practical training of the controllers could only start when the new airport opened yesterday. This training would be completed by May 18, and the airport would be able to operate night flights during the training and would extend its operation to 24-hours for the World Cup.
The restaurants and shops at the airport were full yesterday morning, and there were no major glitches reported. And the dignitaries came out in full force.
Welcoming the first passengers to arrive was KwaZulu-Natal Premier Zweli Mkhize and Economic Development and Tourism MEC Mike Mabuyakhulu, who both praised the facility and its staff for the smooth change-over from Durban International.
Mabuyakhulu described the airport's opening as 'the culmination of a long-held vision and a lot of hard work from various stakeholders'.
'This is a state-of-the-art facility, and it will put us on the global map. With this airport we can increase the number of local tourists, and also foreign tourists.'
A tired-looking Naidoo arrived at the airport at 4.30am yesterday, and told the Tribune that the hard work and effort to relocate had been worth it because of how smoothly the opening day had gone.
Laughing, he said: 'It's kind of surreal that everything's gone so well. In the back of my mind I half-expected something to go wrong or for something to break, especially with so much media around. But it all went smoothly and there were no issues at all.'
At one point an escalator stopped working, but technicians quickly reprogrammed and repaired it, saying it looked like one of the passengers had bumped the emergency stop button with a bag.
One of the biggest frustrations, however, was not inside the airport - the R4 toll leaving to join the N2 freeway heading towards Durban was a particular sore point.
Because the N2 is the only access road to the airport, this toll - albeit small - is unavoidable, and motorists appeared unhappy at not having been consulted about its erection and at not having the choice to use an alternative route.
