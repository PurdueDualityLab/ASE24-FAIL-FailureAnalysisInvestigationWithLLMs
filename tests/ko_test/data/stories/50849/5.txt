There will be night flights - airport

Airport officials moved swiftly yesterday to quash rumours that the new King Shaka International Airport would not be able to handle night-time flights because of issues around air traffic controllers.
Hundreds of people used the new facility when it opened to passengers and visitors yesterday. The first commercial flights left and arrived to much fanfare at 6.30am and 8.02am respectively.
Some "sightseers", according to Airports Company of South Africa (Acsa) spokesman Colin Naidoo, arrived at the airport before 5am to witness and take pictures of the airport's first day, much like a child's first day at school.
But the opening was not without controversy.
Media reports late in the week indicated night flights would not be possible at the new facility because none of the controllers were trained specifically for the air space.
But, in a joint statement, Acsa and the Air Traffic and Navigation Services company said this was not true - all flights would be accommodated at King Shaka according to the same schedule used at Durban International. Essentially, this means the last flights are likely to take off shortly after 9pm and land at about 10pm.
"There is no need to cancel flights as the airport will operate to the same schedule that was in place at the old airport," they said.
However, the organisations admitted that the practical training of controllers could start only when the new airport opened yesterday. This training would be completed by May 18. The airport would be able to operate night flights during the training and would operate 24 hours for the World Cup.
On the map
Restaurants and shops at the airport were full yesterday and no major glitches were reported.
Dignitaries came out in droves. Welcoming the first passengers to arrive was KwaZulu-Natal Premier Zweli Mkhize and Economic Development and Tourism MEC Mike Mabuyakhulu.
Both praised the facility and staff for the smooth change-over from Durban International.
Mabuyakhulu described the opening as "the culmination of a long-held vision and a lot of hard work from various stakeholders".
"This state-of-the-art facility will put us on the global map. With this airport, we can increase the number of local and foreign tourists."
Only flights to and from limited destinations were accommodated at Durban International Airport, but the new airport can handle larger aircraft and so more international destinations will be added to the roster.
Acsa's tired-looking Naidoo, who arrived at the airport at 4.30am yesterday, told the Tribune that the hard work and effort to relocate had been worth it because of the smooth transition that resulted.
At one point an escalator stopped working, but technicians quickly reprogrammed and repaired it, saying it looked as though a passenger had bumped the emergency stop button with their bag.
One big frustration was not inside the airport - motorists appeared unhappy at not having been consulted about the erection of an N2 toll without the option of an alternative route.
