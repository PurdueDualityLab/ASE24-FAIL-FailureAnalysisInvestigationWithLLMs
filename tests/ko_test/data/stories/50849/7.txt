WHILE operations at King Shaka International Airport were relatively smooth on Saturday morning, not all passengers had glitch-free experiences on landing.
Blaze Eigenmann, of Port Shepstone, said that while the airport was beautiful, he felt it was still experiencing "teething problems" after the 1Time flight he was on was unable to connect to an airbridge.
"The airbridge extension was unable to link to the door of the plane, and we were told to exit the plane at the back. We were told there were external stairs at the bottom of the airbridge that would take us into the terminal. It wasn't too far away, and there weren't many stairs, but they were narrow, and it might have been tricky for people like the elderly and the disabled."
Colin Naidoo, of the Airports Company of SA, said that one of the doors on the airbridge was not functional. "As a precaution, passengers were asked to disembark from the back of the plane. Their safety was not affected at all."
Eigenmann also complained that he struggled to find out where to get a shuttle to his car, which was parked at the old airport.
"I was sent from one building to the other, and finally paid for my ticket and took the shuttle to the old airport. Trolleys had been lined up and were blocking the way out of the old airport. There wasn't a single person around to help and I had to move the trolleys myself to get out."
Naidoo apologised for the incident, but said "it's not a big issue". He said the trolley operators were needed at the new airport.
Linda Mossop-Rousseau had a bag go missing, but it was returned to her later that day. An airport official told her that the bag may have been left behind in Joburg and asked her to report it to the baggage claims counter.
Mossop-Rousseau, who had flown from Joburg to visit her mother in hospital, said: "The bag was returned by midday and it had been wrapped in plastic. When it was dropped off, they were very apologetic. I understand that these things do happen... I've also experienced it in Switzerland."
Coin-operated pay phones were also not working at the airport on Saturday, a slight glitch that had been quickly addressed, said Naidoo. "We have technicians on stand-by... at the airport, so that they are there to fix problems whenever they occur."
