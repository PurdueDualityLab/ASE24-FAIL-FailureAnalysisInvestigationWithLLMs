Joy of airport on wheels: [1]

WHEEL grinding on tarmac. The thunder of heavy trucks straining through the humid night. Blue police lights flashing and sirens wailing all down the freeway.
It's 2.30 in the morning, but still there is a fair amount of traffic for a Friday night - or an early Saturday morning to be precise.
We are part of a vast convoy of trucks moving down the road. The Durban Metro Police are stopping all other traffic to let us pass.
It takes a few moments for the motorists surrounding us to realise what is going on. A few of them, mostly groups of young people in their 20s, on their way to and from clubbing, start waving their hands in the air and cheering wildly.
They realise they are witnessing something they are very unlikely to see again - an entire airport being moved in the course of a single night.
I was lucky enough to be part of a film crew doing a documentary on the recent move from the old Durban International Airport to the extraordinary new King Shaka International Airport on the North Coast.
It was, as trucking rigger Jerry Munsamy told me while we were thundering slowly down the freeway, "a once in a lifetime experience".
I have worked as a television producer and writer for 25 years all over the world now and I count being able to witness this airport move as one of the highlights of my career.
The last flight into Durban International arrived just after 10pm on Friday. The first flight out of King Shaka was at 6am on Saturday.
Within the eight hours that separated these two events - the length of an average work shift - the change had to be made.
There was something stirring and grandiose about watching the empty planes taking off from the Durban International tarmac, one by one; it reminded me slightly of the Top Gun feel of a military airport during wartime as the planes rose one after another into the sky.
There was something sad about sitting in the empty business class lounge as the security guards went around from glass door to glass door with a luggage trolley piled high with bright, shiny new chain and brand new locks, wrapping them around the door handles and shutting the airport down as the planes climbed into the night behind them. I couldn't help wondering just who was going to keep all those keys.
"Well, this is it," said Colin Naidoo of Airports Company South Africa (Acsa), as we sat together among the scattered chairs in the empty lounge.
Ghosts
There wasn't much else to say.
The feeling of an end of an era for something as huge as an international airport is bigger than most words can express.
We fell silent for a few moments and one could almost feel the ghosts of a million journeys begun and ended, the destiny of countless lives changed for better or for worse by so many arrivals and departures.
The weight of hope and of sadness held in so many goodbyes until, tonight, the very last farewell.
Still, there was something else to reflect on. Hidden underneath the bland name of "Durban International Airport" was the old name, barely remembered now, of "Louis Botha Airport".
The name itself harking back to the days when he was the first prime minister of the Union of South Africa in 1910.
It was the same year that Frenchman Albert Kimmerling took off from Clairmont in a Voisin aeroplane which, sadly, crashed the next day, although Kimmerling was unharmed.
Aviation in Durban had been born, but, like most technological advancement in this country during the years of segregation and apartheid, it was almost entirely a white privilege to fly.
Naidoo was one of the first senior black managers at Durban International when he began his career there in 1994.
"I didn't know anything about airports then," he told me with a wry smile. "I used to call the tarmac the 'runaway'."
Today, Naidoo and his teammates have come a long way.
The move from the old airport to the new was a lived experience of the best of our often imperfect non-racial society.
Expertise, enthusiasm and a shared sense of determination were what really mattered.
Perhaps it is easy to say that it's obvious that this is how it should be, but it wasn't always like this in our country; and for people like Naidoo, those years of apartheid are still a lived memory.
The success of this massive project is a very important answer to those who believe South Africa does not have the capability to host the World Cup successfully.
More importantly, it is clear evidence that, unlike the post-colonial experience in many African states, South Africa does have the ability to grow and develop using partnerships between imported technology and home-grown expertise.
King Shaka International Airport probably has cost too much.
Certainly the initial estimate of about R1.4 billion has ballooned to about R7 billion.
Nonetheless, the shift was inevitable and the new airport is breathtakingly beautiful and, with the exception of some minor glitches, is operating extremely well.
Our convoy finally arrived at 3am. We drove past the empty planes all neatly lined up at the glassed air bridges, gleaming in the unearthly shine of the tarmac floodlights.
With remarkable speed, Munsamy and his workers off-loaded forklift trucks, movable stairs, trolley carriers and all the other equipment needed to move passengers and their luggage.
Two hours later, the empty parking bays were filling up, the shops and restaurants were doing a roaring trade and the first passengers were checking in.
By 8am history was over.
The first flights had already come and gone and it was so busy the airport looked like it had always been there.
