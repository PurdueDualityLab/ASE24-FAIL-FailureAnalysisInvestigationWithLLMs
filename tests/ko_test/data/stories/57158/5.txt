ELECTRICITY and water losses cost Joburg R2 billion, the auditor-general's report on Joburg for 2010/11 noted.
The electricity losses of R1.217bn included:
-- R568m in technical losses (system or distribution) - down from R727mm in the previous year
-- R649m in non-technical losses (illegal connections, faulty meters, tampering with meters) - up from R108m the year before.
The A-G's report said another R827m was lost because of "unaccounted-for water". (The city's annual report said 39 percent of the city's water was lost - 22 percent in areas with water meters and 84 percent in areas where water use was estimated.)
The A-G said a further R6.165m was lost "as a result of cash losses due to banking shortages".
These R2bn material losses were in addition to R48.5m in unauthorised expenditure (not for the purpose for which it was approved) and R389m in irregular expenditure (not following procedure).
The A-G gave the city a qualified audit.
This was mainly due to problems with property rates revenue, service charges revenue, consumer debtors and leave accrual.
The A-G said there were material differences between billing data and source data relating to property rates and valuations, to electricity and water meter readings and property categories, and regarding debtor data.
Electricity and water meter readings, billing and accounting were not regularly reconciled, and officials did not do enough to make sure that meter readings were credible, the A-G said.
The report said there were investigations into 74 cases of alleged irregularities involving bribery, theft, corruption and tender irregularities.
The city was probing 70 and external investigators were handling four.
Of these, 66 cases had been finalised.
The DA criticised the city for the qualified audit, saying it was "confirmation of the deteriorating state that South Africa's biggest economic hub is in".
"It also bears testament to the poor political leadership the city is currently under," said Mmusi Maimane, the DA's Joburg caucus leader.
He said the DA would ask the mayor to present to the council a "clear and workable" turnaround plan..
THE billing crisis remains the biggest challenge for the City of Joburg, manager Trevor Fowler has admitted.
Acknowledging the qualified audit from the auditor-general - the second in a row, - he said action had already been taken to sort it out.
A roadmap for revenue and billing enhancement introduced by the city in November would "enable us to increase the accuracy and integrity of our billing data".
The "technical glitches" in the billing system that were the main cause of the qualified audit were being addressed.
"The new city administration has taken proactive steps to strengthen internal control mechanisms, enhance revenue management, and improve the consistency of data and records," Fowler said.
Interventions include a "more customer-centric approach to billing and revenue", a turnaround plan with clear deadlines and better oversight, he said.
Chief operating officer Gerald Dumas was confident these interventions would resolve the billing concerns. "By the end of June 2012, all billings crisis issues will be resolved," he said.
The City of Joburg's annual report for 2010/2011, tabled at the council yesterday, showed that total revenue collection for 2010/11 was R19.028 billion, slightly above target.
There are 109 000 billing queries in the system at the moment, of which 56 000 are revenue related.
The Rea Vaya Bus Rapid Transit system is one of the defining achievements of the city in the past five years, said City of Joburg manager Trevor Fowler yesterday.
An average of 30 000 passengers a day was reached, against a target of 20 000.
Monthly passenger numbers peaked at 1 million people in the third quarter of the year.
"The bus occupancy rates during peak hours increased from 70 percent at the start of the year to 95 percent at the end."
Pikitup, the city's waste-removal company, is effectively bankrupt, according to the Auditor-General, which gave the city a qualified audit report for the second year.
Pikitup's liabilities exceeded its assets by R353m, the A-G report noted. The entity has an accumulated deficit of R363m.
"These conditions indicated the existence of a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the entity's ability to operate as a going concern," said the A-G.
