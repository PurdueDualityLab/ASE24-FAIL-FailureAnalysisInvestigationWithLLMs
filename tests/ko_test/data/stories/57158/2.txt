INFRASTRUCTURE is on track, but billing problems are still dogging the City of Joburg, resulting in a qualified audit opinion for the metro.
This morning City of Joburg manager Trevor Fowler said revenue collection for the 2010/11 financial year was R19.028 billion.
Although this is slightly above the target of R19bn, the collection ratio was 88 percent of what was billed, which was below the target of 92 percent.
Fowler acknowledged the 'technical glitches' in the billing system and said the city was addressing these.
The details are in the |city's annual report which was presented to the council this morning.
The report is for the municipal financial year from July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2011. It was tabled within days of the deadline of within seven months of the end of the financial year.
Fowler said the Auditor General (AG) report on Joburg for 2010/11 contained qualified opinions which the city acknowledged.
'The new city administration has taken pro-active steps to strengthen internal control mechanisms, enhance revenue management and improve the consistency of data and records,' said Fowler.
'We are confident that the roadmap for revenue and billing enhancement announced by the city in November will enable us to increase the accuracy and integrity of our billing data.
'This will, in turn, be reflected in the quality of the city's financial reporting.'
The AG qualifications focused on the revenue management and consistency of records used for billing customers.
Matters which Fowler highlighted included: The Rea Vaya Rapid Bus Transport System which carried an average of 30 000 passengers a day against the target of 20 000, with more than 1 million people a month now being carried; The creation of 60 000 job opportunities against the target of 25 000 and inner city upgrading, involving the setting up of eight consortiums to refurbish 30 buildings and plans to expropriate another 108 properties.
The inner city upgrading budget of R115.8m was spent and all projects completed, including refurbishment of Chancellor House and Beyers Naud&Atilde; Square; more than 300km of infrastructure for the Joburg broadband network was laid, exceeding the annual target of 200km; another 4 369 households were electrified, higher than the target of 3 000 although there is still a backlog of 212 000 households.
More than 676 400 residents were helped to get various government grants, benefits and services. The World Cup project to plant 200 000 new trees was finished. The Cosmo City housing programme was completed, with 4 880 subsidised houses occupied.
More than nine out of every 10 Joburg residents now get water for drinking and household purposes, reliable electricity, sanitation and regular waste disposal.
