INFRASTRUCTURE is on track but ongoing billing problems mean another qualified audit for Joburg.
Rea Vaya is Joburg's big success, said City of Joburg manager Trevor Fowler, commenting on the city's annual report for 2010/11, which was tabled at the council yesterday.
The report is for the municipal financial year from July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2011.
It was tabled within days of the deadline of seven months from the end of the financial year.
"The Rea Vaya Bus Rapid Transit System is one of the defining achievements of Johannesburg over the past five years," said Fowler.
"An average of 30 000 passengers per day was reached, against a target of 20 000.
"Monthly passenger numbers exceeded 1 million people since the third quarter of the year.
"The bus occupancy rates during peak hours increased from 70 percent at the start of the year to 95 percent at the end."
Total revenue collection for 2010/11 was R19.028 billion, slightly above target.
However, the collection ratio was 88 percent of what was billed, which was below the target of 92 percent.
Fowler acknowledged the city's qualified audit from the auditor-general - the second in a row - and said action had already been taken to sort it out.
Fowler referred to the "technical glitches" in the billing system that were the main cause of the qualified audit, saying these were being addressed.
"The new city administration has taken proactive steps to strengthen internal control mechanisms, enhance revenue management, and improve the consistency of data and records," Fowler said.
"We are confident that the roadmap for revenue and billing enhancement announced by the city in November will enable us to increase the accuracy and integrity of our billing data."
Interventions include a "more customer-centric approach to billing and revenue", a turnaround plan with clear deadlines, and better oversight, he said.
Fowler said Joburg was the most productive metro area in SA and "the city spends more per head on basic services, capital projects and business infrastructure than any other city".
The DA criticised the city for the qualified audit and said it would ask the mayor to present to the council a "clear and workable" turnaround plan.
"The City of Johannesburg's second qualified report is a confirmation of the deteriorating state that South Africa's biggest economic hub is in.
"It also bears testament to the poor political leadership the city is currently under," said Mmusi Maimane, the DA's Joburg caucus leader.
