WQED-FM (89.3) has entered the digital era of broadcasting. Last week the station unveiled its new broadcast production facilities at a ribbon-cutting ceremony celebrating the completion of the technical upgrade.
Good sound quality is important for any radio station, but even more so in classical formats, where there is a wider range of sounds and volumes to bring across.
The project was funded by a $400,000 grant from the Bayer Foundation, along with $150,000 from The Pittsburgh Foundation for digital editing equipment and $50,000 in federal funds from the Department of Commerce for expansion of the signal to Johnstown.
Years in planning and months in constructing, the new equipment is all up and running. It includes computers equipped with digital editing software that will replace the old razor blade and tape method of editing recordings. A new high-end production studio will be used for final production of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra/River City Brass Band national broadcasts and CD mastering.
Digital production allows producers to use their time more efficiently, meaning that they can go out into the field more often to record local classical performers, such as the "Performance in Pittsburgh" series.
In the studio used for live performances, wood floors - which musicians prefer because it doesn't absorb sound - have replaced carpet. New acoustic materials were added to the walls and ceiling to improve sound quality.
The record library was renovated to house compact discs instead of vinyl records. They now have twice as much storage space, with room to grow from the current library of 19,000 CDs.
The station can now begin the process of transferring recordings from vinyl to compact disc, with "no noise" technology that will remove the pops and hisses that plague vinyl records.
Listeners can expect improved sound quality and more locally produced programming because of the changes. "'The sound is clearer and cleaner than ever,"' says general manager Jim Cunningham. The signal will also be more reliable: The automated system should eliminate glitches in late-night syndicated programs that sometimes knocked the station off the air for a few minutes.
The next step is to replace the old antenna with a more state-of-the-art model, which will happen through a grant of $95,600 from The Pittsburgh Foundation.
Many of the new developments at WQED in recent years came about because of this project, including its 24-hour-a-day Internet broadcasts and the WQEJ-FM simulcasts in Johnstown, which started in December.

ALL TALK: Rich Vargo is the new director of programming operations at WPTT-AM (1360). Vargo was previously production director at the station.
And all-talk WPTT is gradually phasing out its remaining sports programming on weekends.
Fans of syndicated Art Bell now can get extra hours of the show on weekends. Best-of selections from the nightly "Coast to Coast with Art Bell" show air overnights until 8 a.m. Saturdays and Sundays.
The station has also picked up "Dreamland," also hosted by Bell, which focuses a little more heavily on the "X-Files" kinds of topics heard on the regular nightly show. "Dreamland" airs Saturdays and Sundays from 9 p.m. to midnight.

AROUND THE DIAL: WQED will broadcast from Chautauqua with live performances and interviews this weekend - Friday from 6 to 9 a.m. and Saturday from 7 a.m. to noon. On Saturday at 8 p.m., the station will air a live broadcast of the Chautauqua Symphony Orchestra. . . . WJJJ-FM (104.7) news and public affairs director Leslie Greer is headed out of town for a new job in Denver with Classical Public Radio Network. Greer leaves at the end of the month. The station is looking for a replacement. In the interim, former WPXI news anchor Della Crews will fill in as news person on the morning show with host Carl Anderson.
