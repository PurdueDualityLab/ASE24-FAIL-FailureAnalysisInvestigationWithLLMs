‘This apology for ruining my life is too little, too late’

TAXMEN have finally said “sorry” to an Aberdeen businessman who said his life was ruined by a computer glitch.
Dad-of-three Eddie Fowler ran a successful recruitment agency with a £1 million turnover until the error landed him in trouble.
The glitch – outwith his control – meant he was unable to file a tax return.
His firm – Allsorts Taskforce – went into liquidation, his bank accounts were sequestrated, he was forced to hand over his credit cards and even his car keys.
Today Mr Fowler said he had received two letters from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) – one apologising for the trouble caused and a second he could share with former business partners to show he had done nothing wrong.
He said: “We still have a long way to go and my solicitor is looking into what the next move should be.
“Saying sorry doesn’t change what happened to me and a letter for the people I used to work with is six years too late.”
A letter to Mr Fowler from Dave Hartnett, Permanent Secretary for Tax stated: “We were wrong to have sequestrated you, and our failure to investigate the matter properly was wholly inexcusable.
“I am concerned that we do everything possible to mitigate the effects of our mistakes and mishandling.
“I hope these measures will go some way towards remedying the injustice you suffered and I apologise again for the unnecessary distress we have caused you.”
An ombudsman had found in Mr Fowler’s favour and ruled that HMRC showed “reckless disregard” for the businessman.
HMRC was also ordered to pay Mr Fowler £50,000 compensation.
Mr Fowler, who said his firm was worth between £350,000 and £400,000 at the time, ran into difficulties in 2002 when a computerised accounting system failed.
The failure meant Mr Fowler had problems filing his VAT return.
He was asked to pay £37,000 by HMRC for his VAT bill, which he said he paid, and was shocked when a warrant officer turned up to close his business just a few months later.
And HMRC had already begun bankruptcy proceedings, known in Scotland as sequestration, against the company.
It later admitted errors – but Mr Fowler had no legal recourse to overturn the sequestration order.
