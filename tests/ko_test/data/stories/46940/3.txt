MILLIONS of self- employed workers could end up paying tax which is not yet due because of a glitch in the HM Revenue & Customs website.
Those filling in an online return are being asked to pay their tax for the last financial year - and make a contribution towards the amount due for this year.
However, although the back tax must be paid by midnight today, half of the so-called 'payment on account' is not due until July.
But HMRC has not publicised the website error because they fear it could cause chaos so near to the annual deadline.
And while it charges an interest rate of 3 per cent to those who owe it money, it will not pay out any interest on cash which is handed over too early.
More than nine million people will fill in self-assessment forms this year, and two out of every three do so online. Many of those will wait until the last moment to complete their forms.
This means they rely on the Revenue website to calculate the final figure they need to pay by tonight's deadline.
The current problem affects self-employed taxpayers who have a bill of more than Pounds 2,000.
These people are asked by the Revenue to contribute towards next year's bill as well as pay their tax for the previous year.
Although half of the 'payment on account' is due today, the other half is not due for another six months. Despite this, the Revenue website is asking for the full amount.
As a result, many self-employed workers will automatically assume they must pay this amount now.
Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of taxation at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, yesterday criticised the confusing calculations on the HMRC website.
He said: 'The issue here is how will ordinary people be able to tell their figures are wrong.
'In the current economic climate it is going to be even more critical.
There will be people overpaying who cannot afford to.
'It is no good Revenue and Customs saying there is a glitch in the system - people need to be told about it.
'They need to be clear about it and come clean. My advice to taxpayers is that they need to examine the tax demand they receive.
'If it looks at all spurious, or they feel they are being asked to pay much more than they expected, they should call HMRC.'
Mark Wallace of the TaxPayers'
Alliance said: 'Yet again HMRC have seriously let taxpayers down.
'Everyone is struggling to keep their heads above water at the moment, and the last thing they need is HMRC increasing their tax bill.
'It's no use for the Government to talk about helping people and then make errors like this.'
A spokesman for the Revenue said: 'Nobody will pay more tax than they need to.
'This issue only affects those customers who make payments on account but we are taking it very seriously and apologise for any inconvenience caused.'
Tax inspectors have been overpaid by Pounds 8million in the last three years thanks to a glitch in their payroll system, it emerged yesterday.
HMRC employees pocketed an extra Pounds 3.9million in the last financial year, Pounds 2.3million in the 06/0 7 year and Pounds 1.5million the year before that, mak- ing a total of almost Pounds 8million. Just Pounds 5million has so far been reclaimed from the workers' pay packets.
Taxpayers who have been caught in the iron grip of a Government tax demand will be amazed at the revelation that Revenue staff are allowed special terms to pay back the cash in instalments.
A spokesman for HMRC said: 'There are a number of different reasons why salaries can be overpaid - these include late notification of an employee leaving or of other pay related changes.
'Our aim is to reduce the number of overpayments that occur.'
