To cut the cord, or not to cut? That is the question a growing number of people are asking themselves now that they're free to switch their home phone number to a cell phone.
So far, about 60,000 have decided to make the all-wireless leap since new federal rules took effect Nov. 24, according to confidential figures gathered by The Associated Press.
While the early tally casts some doubt on the most optimistic projections that millions might cut the cord within a year, there are signs demand is on the rise.
That said, thousands of the wireline-to-wireless switches already requested have yet to be filled due to glitches in the process, and many customers have even been left without any phone service for several days.
'There are orders from the first week of December that haven't gone through yet,' said Elizabeth Frohse, an industry consultant for Cap Gemini Ernst & Young who attended an industry meeting Wednesday intended to help fix the problems.
At one major wireless carrier, about a third of the new customers looking to move a home number to a cell phone tired of waiting and canceled their orders 'out of frustration,' a source at the company said, speaking on condition that the provider not be identified.
Due to the delays, cellular companies are cautioning their would-be converts to all-wireless that the process could take weeks, if not months. Rules set by the Federal Communications Commission require the companies to complete the process within four days.
Still, at Wednesday's meeting, many cell phone companies indicated wireline-to-wireless orders are on the rise, Frohse said. They didn't disclose specific figures. The tally of 60,000 requests received through last week was calculated with data supplied by wireless company sources for the sole purpose of compiling an industry-wide figure.
Now that more orders are being processed successfully, 'There's word of mouth. People are saying 'Hey this works. You really can take your home phone to your cell phone,' said Frohse, noting that the FCC publicly suggested that consumers hold off until the industry could work out the expected glitches.
Before the new rules took effect, an estimated 3 percent of the nation's cell phone subscribers, about 4.5 million people, said they had no wired phone service, according to an October survey by the Pew Internet & American Life Project.
One obvious appeal for those early adopters has been the simplicity of steering all calls to a single phone number that follows them everywhere.
But even with the new freedom to move a landline number to a cell as added incentive, there can be substantial drawbacks to going all wireless, starting with poor indoor reception.
In addition, while moving a home number to a cell phone may be appealing for a first-time wireless subscriber, it's not so clear how many of the nation's 155 million mobile phone users are anxious to replace a wireless number to which they've grown attached.
Abandoning a home phone may work for young adults, mostly singles in their 20s and 30s who are its sole users. But families and others who live together can find it hard to share a single cell phone that needs to be used as both a home number and a mobile number. One option is to sign up for a wireless family plan that gives each family member a cell phone with a different number, but such plans can get expensive.
Emily O'Brien, who works in public relations at the Hoffman Agency in Denver, called her local phone company, Qwest Communications, to turn off her service on Tuesday. She was having a high-speed Internet line installed by her cable TV company, so she no longer needed a home line for dial-up Internet access.
Originally, O'Brien had planned to take advantage of the new rules, moving her home number to her cell phone so acquaintances who don't know her mobile number would still be able to call her. But then she just decided to turn off her home phone and keep her existing cell number, which her friends find so easy to memorize that they lobbied her not to give it up.
'A lot of friends, even though they know I'm home, call the cell because that's the one they remember,' said O'Brien, who is 27 and lives alone, so she won't be leaving any family members or roommates phoneless when she and the cell phone are out and about.
'My friends pointed out that most of the people I am close to have my cell phone number,' said O'Brien. 'I also figured a lot of telemarketers have my home number, and if they can't get me on my cell line, then great.'
