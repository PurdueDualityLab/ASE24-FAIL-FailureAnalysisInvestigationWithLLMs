NEW YORK -- To cut the cord, or not to cut? That is the question a growing number of people are asking themselves now that they're free to switch their home phone number to a cell phone.
So far, about 60,000 have decided to make the all-wireless leap since new federal rules took effect Nov. 24, according to confidential figures gathered by The Associated Press.
While the early tally casts some doubt on the most optimistic projections that millions might cut the cord within a year, there are signs demand is on the rise.
That said, thousands of the wireline-to-wireless switches already requested have yet to be filled due to glitches in the process, and many customers have even been left without any phone service for days.
"There are orders from the first week of December that haven't gone through yet," said Elizabeth Frohse, an industry consultant for Cap Gemini Ernst & Young.
At one major wireless carrier, about a third of the new customers looking to move a home number to a cell phone tired of waiting and canceled their orders "out of frustration," a source at the company said, speaking on condition the provider not be identified.
Due to the delays, cellular companies are cautioning their would- be converts to all-wireless that the process could take weeks, if not months. Rules set by the Federal Communications Commission require the companies to complete the process within four days.
