60,000 'CUTTING THE CORD' UNDER RULES LETTING HOME PHONE NUMBERS GO WIRELESS: [SOONER Edition]

To cut the cord or not to cut? That is the question a growing number of people are asking themselves now that they're free to switch their home phone number to a cell phone.
So far, about 60,000 have decided to make the all-wireless leap since new federal rules took effect Nov. 24, according to confidential figures gathered by The Associated Press.
While the early tally casts some doubt on the most optimistic projections that millions might cut the cord within a year, there are signs demand is on the rise.
That said, thousands of the wireline-to-wireless switches already requested have yet to be filled due to glitches in the process, and many customers have even been left without any phone service for several days.
"There are orders from the first week of December that haven't gone through yet," said Elizabeth Frohse, an industry consultant for Cap Gemini Ernst & Young who attended an industry meeting Wednesday intended to help fix the problems.
At one major wireless carrier, about a third of the new customers looking to move a home number to a cell phone tired of waiting and canceled their orders "out of frustration," a source at the company said.
Due to the delays, cellular companies are cautioning their would- be converts to all-wireless that the process could take weeks, if not months. Rules set by the Federal Communications Commission require the companies to complete the process within four days.
Still, at Wednesday's meeting, many cell phone companies indicated "wireline-to-wireless" orders were on the rise, Frohse said. They didn't disclose specific figures. The tally of 60,000 requests received through last week was calculated with data supplied by wireless company sources for the sole purpose of compiling an industrywide figure.
Now that more orders are being processed successfully, "There's word of mouth. People are saying, 'Hey this works. You really can take your home phone to your cell phone,'" said Frohse, noting that the FCC publicly suggested that consumers hold off until the industry could work out the expected glitches.
