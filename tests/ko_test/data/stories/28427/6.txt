Thousands cutting cord, moving home phone numbers to wireless By BRUCE MEYERSON AP Business Writer NEW YORK To cut the cord, or not to cut? That is the question a growing number of people are asking themselves now that theyre free to switch their home phone number to a cell phone. So far, about 60,000 have decided to make the all-wireless leap since new federal rules took effect Nov. 24, according to confidential figures gathered by The Associated Press. While the early tally casts some doubt on the most optimistic projections that millions might cut the cord within a year, there are signs that demand is on the rise. That said, thousands of the wireline-to-wireless switches already requested have yet to be filled due to glitches in the process, and many customers have even been left without any phone service for several days. There are orders from the first week of December that havent gone through yet, said Elizabeth Frohse, an industry consultant for Cap Gemini Ernst & Young who attended an industry meeting Wednesday intended to help fix the problems. At one major wireless carrier, about a third of the new customers looking to move a home number to a cell phone tired of waiting and canceled their orders, a source at the company said, speaking on condition that the provider not be identified. Cellular companies are cautioning their would-be converts to all-wireless that the process could take weeks, if not months. Rules set by the Federal Communications Commission require the companies to complete the process within four days. Still, at Wednesdays meeting, many cell phone companies indicated wireline-to-wireless orders are on the rise, Frohse said. They didnt disclose specific figures. The tally of 60,000 requests received through last week was calculated with data supplied by wireless company sources for the sole purpose of compiling an industry-wide figure. Now that more orders are being processed successfully, Theres word of mouth. People are saying Hey, this works. You really can take your home phone to your cell phone, said Frohse, noting that the FCC publicly suggested that consumers hold off until the industry could work out the expected glitches. Before the new rules took effect, an estimated 3 percent of the nations cell phone subscribers, about 4.5 million people, said they had no wired phone service, according to an October survey by the Pew Internet & American Life Project. One obvious appeal for those early adopters has been the simplicity of steering all calls to a single phone number that follows them everywhere. But even with the new freedom to move a landline number to a cell as added incentive, there can be substantial drawbacks to going all wireless, starting with poor indoor reception. Emily OBrien, who works in public relations at the Hoffman Agency in Denver, called her local phone company, Qwest Communications, to turn off her service on Tuesday. She was having a high-speed Internet line installed by her cable TV company, so she no longer needed a home line for dial-up Internet access. Originally, OBrien had planned to take advantage of the new rules. But she decided to turn off her home phone and keep her existing cell number.
