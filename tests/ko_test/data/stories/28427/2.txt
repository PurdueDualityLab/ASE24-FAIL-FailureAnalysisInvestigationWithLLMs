NEW YORK -- To cut the cord, or not to cut? That is the question a growing number of people are asking themselves now that they're free to switch their home phone number to a cell phone.
So far, about 60,000 have decided to make the all-wireless leap since new federal rules took effect Nov. 24, according to confidential figures gathered by the Associated Press.
While the early tally casts some doubt on the most optimistic projections that millions might cut the cord within a year, there are signs demand is on the rise.
That said, thousands of the wireline-to-wireless switches already requested have yet to be filled due to glitches in the process, and many customers have even been left without any phone service for several days.
"There are orders from the first week of December that haven't gone through yet," said Elizabeth Frohse, a consultant for Cap Gemini Ernst & Young who attended an industry meeting Wednesday intended to help fix the problems. At one major wireless carrier, about a third of the new customers looking to move a home number to a cell phone were tired of waiting and canceled orders.
