OTTAWA (CP) - A U.S. space official's version of what likely happened during the time Telesat Canada's two Anik satellites contradicts the company's account.
Telesat said a massive electromagnetic storm was likely behind the unprecedented problems that plagued two of its satellites last week.
But Dave Speich of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, Colo., said yesterday he has seen worse spaces disturbances than the one Telesat blamed for temporarily disabling Anik E1 and knocking out Anik E2. He also does not call the disturbance an electromagnetic storm.
Meanwhile, Antonio Ocaranza of the Mexican embassy in Ottawa denied a Telesat official's claim that a Mexican satellite in the vicinity of the Aniks also experienced glitches.
As well, a spokesperson for the U.S. Intelsat-K satellite, part of the same series as the Aniks, denied Telesat's claim that Intelsat-K had problems a few hours before Telesat's satellites ran into trouble.
Jewish group to fight teacher's return
OTTAWA (CP) - The Canadian Jewish Congress will ask the Supreme Court of Canada to overturn a lower court decision that opens the door for teacher Malcolm Ross to return to the classroom.
'Clearly, Malcolm Ross is a public anti-Semite,' said Hal Joffe, national community relations chairperson for the organization. 'The possibility of him returning to a public school classroom is anathema to Canadian society and would have a chilling impact on all vulnerable minorities.'
Ross, a Moncton, N.B., junior high school teacher, was banned from teaching in 1991 following a public inquiry into his anti-Semitic writings.
