U.S. official differs on satellite explanation

A U.S. space official's version of what likely happened during the time Telesat Canada's two Anik satellites ran into trouble is different from the company's account on several points.
Telesat said a massive electromagnetic storm was likely behind the unprecedented problems that plagued two of its satellites last week.
In fact, Telesat president Larry Boisvert said the storm 'was 100 times greater than other similar storms seen before.'
But Dave Speich, space forecaster with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, Colo., said yesterday he's seen worse space disturbances than the one Telesat blamed for temporarily disabling Anik E-1 and knocking out Anik E-2.
For the record, NOAA says the sun has caused an anomaly or a 'moderate to high' enhancement of high-energy electrons since Jan. 13.
'We have seen levels of these high levels of high-energy particles in the past and even higher than what we saw beginning on the 13th of January,' Mr. Speich said.
On Friday, Mr. Boisvert said 'a massive geomagnetic storm' probably knocked out the Anik satellites. It was a storm, he said, of unparalleled proportions.
'Recent information from an environmental satellite recorded a massive geomagnetic storm at the location of our satellites during the time of the failures,' Mr. Boisvert said.
Anik E-1 has since been restored to full service. Anik E-2 is widely believed to be space junk.
Len Stass, Telesat's vice-president of space operations, told Friday's news conference that a Mexican satellite in the vicinity of the Aniks also experienced glitches after the electromagnetic storm. But Antonio Ocaranza, a spokesman for the Mexican embassy in Ottawa, said his government has no report of trouble of that kind Thursday.
Mr. Stass acknowledged yesterday the report of difficulties with a Mexican satellite was unconfirmed. He also said the U.S. Intelsat-K satellite, part of the same series as the Aniks, had problems a few hours before Telesat's satellites ran into trouble.
But Intelsat spokesman Tony Trujillo said there was no disruption of service from Intelsat-K.
Mr. Speich said it is hard at any time to determine what went wrong with a space craft.
