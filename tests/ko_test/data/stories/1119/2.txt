U.S. official questions cause of satellite trouble

(CP) - A U.S. space official's version of what likely happened during the time Telesat Canada's two Anik satellites ran into trouble is different from the company's account on several points.
Telesat said a massive electromagnetic storm was likely behind the unprecedented problems that plagued two of its satellites last week.
In fact, Telesat president Larry Boisvert said the storm 'was 100 times greater than other similar storms seen before.'
But Dave Speich, space forecaster with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, Colo., said Monday he's seen worse spaces disturbances than the one Telesat blamed for temporarily disabling Anik E-1 and knocking out Anik E-2.
He also does not call the disturbance an electromagnetic storm.
For the record, NOAA says the sun has caused an anomaly or a 'moderate to high' enhancement of high-energy electrons since Jan. 13.
'This is what I call an enhancement of moderate to high levels,' Speich said.
'We have seen levels of these high levels of high-energy particles in the past and even higher than what we saw beginning on the 13th of January.'
In a news conference Friday, Telesat president Larry Boisvert said 'a massive geomagnetic storm' probably knocked out the Anik satellites.
It was a storm, he said, of unparalleled proportions.
'Recent information from an environmental satellite recorded a massive geomagnetic storm at the location of our satellites during the time of the failures,' Boisvert said in explaining the failures, which disrupted broadcast communications and northern telephone links.
'This storm was on a magnitude 100 times greater than other, similar storms seen before.'
Anik E-1 has since been restored to full service. Anik E-2 is still out of service and is widely believed to be reduced to space junk.
Boisvert could not be reached for comment Monday.
Len Stass, Telesat's vice-president of space operations, told Friday's news conference that a Mexican satellite in the vicinity of the Aniks also experienced glitches after the electromagnetic storm.
But Antonio Ocaranza, a spokesman for the Mexican embassy in Ottawa, said his government has no report of trouble of that kind Thursday.
