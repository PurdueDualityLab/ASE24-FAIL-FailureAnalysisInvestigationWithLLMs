OTTAWA, Jan 22 (AFP) - Technicians tried in vain Saturday to make contact with a telecommunications satellite that has suddenly gone deaf, hampering radio and television broadcasts all over Canada.
The glitch has proved to be an embarrassment for struggling Telesat Canada, a formerly state-owned firm that laid off 37 percent of its employees last year and reported a loss of 16.7 million dollars (12.7 million US) for the first nine months of 1993.
The 300 million dollar (228 million US) Anik E-2 satellite stopped receiving signals from ground controllers on Thursday, possibly when it ran into a fierce electromagnetic storm, Telesat officials said.
Major Canadian television networks account for nearly half of Telesat's revenue, and they may consider taking their business elsewhere because of the satellite snafu, said telecommunications analyst Greg O'Donnell.
Telesat Canada is owned by a consortium of Canadian telephone companies and Spar Aerospace.
