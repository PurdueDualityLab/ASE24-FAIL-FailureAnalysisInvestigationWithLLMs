One day into the job, Lukas Rossi was already relishing his new position as front man of Supernova.
'It's like a mountain of power behind me,' the Toronto singer said of performing live with Tommy Lee (Motley Crue), Gilby Clarke (Guns N' Roses) and Jason Newsted (Metallica).
'It's going to be a great rock show, I can tell you that.' Lee has even opened his Los Angeles home to Rossi, who won the job Wednesday in the fi nale to Rock Star: Supernova.
'I'm actually at his pad right now, man,' Rossi, 29, said over the phone Thursday. 'It's really cool, dude.' After singing and celebrating Wednesday, Rossi was talking all day Thursday.
'It's been crazy press, man,' he said.
'But it's cool. Like everyone is supporting me.
It's really, really overwhelming.' Lee called Rossi 'the real deal.' 'He proved that he's got the voice and swagger to front this band,' Lee said in a statement. 'He's going to tear it up in the studio and then we're taking the show on the road. Wear a cup, kids.' Rossi even got a few hours sleep after a postwrap bash that saw all the contestants reunited, plus friends and families, to watch the show that had been taped earlier in the day.
'It was an awesome party, man,' Rossi said.
The former Hooters fry cook, who said he was 'broke as a joke' coming into the show, knows his life won't be the same.
'I guess not, man. I'm still going to be the same person and write records and tour. I guess it will be blown up more than usual, but I'm ready for it brother.' First up is recording the new album, which is due out Nov. 21, with producer Butch Walker.
Two singles -- It's All Love and Be Yourself & 5 Other Cliches -- will be available for sale Thursday on the Internet (www.music.yahoo.com).
Rossi said the album will contain two of his songs, including Headspin, which he played several times on the TV show.
Rossi follows in the footsteps of fellow Canadian J.D. Fortune, who won last year's show and now sings with Australia's INXS. Fortune and his band are currently touring Down Under.
Rossi beat out Dilana Robichaux, a transplanted South African now living in Houston, for the job. The two held hands on stage as Lee prepared to hand down the band's verdict.
'I haven't been nervous the whole time (in the show). That was the one point where I was getting a little off-kilter,' Rossi acknowledged.
FINALE TO AIR AGAIN TONIGHT
The fallout from a technical glitch during the Rock Star: Supernova TV fi nale widened Thursday as Global acknowledged the problem was more extensive than originally thought.
Because of an error in identifying the correct satellite feed, viewers in much of the country -- from Manitoba eastward -- missed almost half of the show, seeing canned highlights of past episodes instead. On Wednesday night, a Global spokesperson said only Ontario was affected.
The blunder left confused viewers across seven provinces scratching their heads in the minutes leading up to Toronto's Lukas Rossi being chosen lead singer of the band Supernova.
Global got an earful Thursday from fans of the popular show, which drew 1.4 million viewers in Canada for each of the fi nal two episodes Tuesday and Wednesday. 'We had a huge reaction from viewers,' said Barbara Williams, senior vice-president of programming and production for CanWest MediaWorks.
The network repeated the show in its entirety later Wednesday in Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec and plans to air it again nationally tonight (check local listings).
The error originated with CBS in Los Angeles, according to Global. 'I think it was simple human error, honestly,' said Williams. 'The feed co-ordinator down at CBS in Los Angeles, I think, miscommunicated.'
