On Wednesday night Lukas Rossi became the latest Canadian to be named a rock star.
The Toronto native was one of four contestants on Rock Star: Supernova vying to become the singer for a hard rock supergroup featuring drummer Tommy Lee (Motley Crue), guitarist Gilby Clarke (Guns N' Roses) and bassist Jason Newsted (Metallica).
Rossi is slated to front his more famous bandmates for the first time in a full show on Jan. 1 in Las Vegas.
'They're amazing guys. It'd be my honour to lead them on a world tour,' said Rossi after the show.
The newly formed group is to record an album and embark on a 28-city North American tour.
Supernova may not stick as their name, however, as an existing California band is mounting a legal challenge.
Just hours before the show aired, a United States District Court judge issued a preliminary injunction barring the reality band from performing, recording or selling music under the Supernova name pending the outcome of the lawsuit.
In contention with Rossi were Iceland's Magni Asgeirsson, Australian Toby Rand and Dilana Robichaux, a South African living in Houston. Eleven other contestants were eliminated over a 13-week period prior to the final show.
In the end it came down to Robichaux and Rossi, with the winner a Canadian for the second time in as many seasons. J.D. Fortune of Oakville, Ont., won the contest last year to become lead singer of INXS, which was popular in the 1980s.
Liked Rossi's look, energy
'I wouldn't have come here if I wanted second or third place,' Rossi, a 29-year-old former fry cook, told CBC News before the final.
In the end, Lee says the band favoured the person who garnered the most votes from fans.
'Lukas, your look, your energy, your vocals, the way you move, everything has been really, really amazing for us,' said Lee before declaring the Torontonian the winner.
Robichaux was given equal praise and invited to join the tour as a supporting act. Clarke then offered his services as writer and producer on her record.
Quickly, Lee, Clarke and Newsted joined Rossi on the stage, and they performed like old pros with Rossi shouting out: 'Let's do this, baby.'
Wednesday night's broadcast hit a major glitch as Global Television's master control made a gaffe. It meant that those from Manitoba eastward got the international feed of the show, a long version with highlights from the season in which 11 other singers were sent packing.
By the time, Global got the right feed, Ontario residents had missed almost half of the final show. Viewers did not see Icelander Asgeirsson perform and get kicked off and they missed Australian Rand joining Rossi and Robichaux performing for one last time in an effort to win the band's favour.
The network announced Thursday it would repeat the show in its entirety Friday night and viewers should check local listings for the times. For those in Ontario, where Rossi is from, it will be on Global at 8 p.m. local time.
Rossi has spent a decade honing his singing career. The spiky-haired, tattooed singer had been working at part-time jobs and playing with his own band, Rise Electric. But those close to him knew he could do more, said bandmate Dominic Cifarelli.
'He's a rock star, period. He has the voice,' said Cifarelli.
The new band's concert schedule includes three dates in Canada so far - Jan 23 in Montreal, Jan. 24 in Toronto and Feb. 19 in Vancouver.
