TORONTO - The fallout from a technical glitch during the Rock Star: Supernova TV finale widened Thursday as Global acknowledged the problem was more extensive than originally thought.
Because of an error in identifying the correct satellite feed, viewers in much of the country -- from Manitoba eastward -- missed almost half of the show, seeing highlights of past episodes instead. On Wednesday night, a Global spokes-man said only Ontario was affected.
The blunder left confused viewers across seven provinces scratching their heads in the minutes leading up to Toronto's Lukas Rossi being chosen lead singer of the band Supernova.
Global got an earful Thursday from fans of the popular show, which drew 1.4 million viewers in Canada for each of the final two episodes Tuesday and Wednesday.
'We had a huge reaction from viewers,' said Barbara Williams, senior vice-president of programming and production for CanWest MediaWorks.
The network repeated the show in its entirety later Wednesday in Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec -- local news prevented a repeat in the Maritimes -- and plans to air it again nationally on Friday night (check local listings).
The error originated with CBS in Los Angeles, according to Global.
'I think it was simple human error, honestly,' said Williams. 'The feed co-ordinator down at CBS in Los Angeles, I think, miscommunicated.'
Viewers in Manitoba and east got the international feed of the show, a two-hour version that started with a string of highlights from past episodes, instead of the one-hour domestic feed.
By the time Global realized the error, switching feeds during a commercial break, almost half of the meat of the finale had come and gone.
Viewers in the affected areas lost one of the four finalists altogether, as Iceland's Magni Asgeirsson was eliminated before the feed was restored.
Those viewers were taken to a commercial break with a promise of more highlights to come. When the show returned, Magni had disappeared and Rossi was in mid-song.
Not to mention the fact that co-host Brooke Burke somehow had managed a costume change.
The affected regions had no idea how the final four were being culled since the segment explaining the format never made it to air. Lost was Burke explaining that the Icelander and Australia's Toby Rand had got the fewest votes among the final four.
Also missing was footage of Magni playing Jimi Hendrix's Fire and Rand tackling Billy Idol's White Wedding, Magni being sent packing and the final three making their last pitch to the band.
Further confusing the affected audience, the misplaced Magni showed up to play acoustic guitar with Rossi and Supernova in the final song of the night.
A Global spokesman said the network usually receives two identical feeds -- just before airtime in the case of Rock Star: Supernova -- with one as a backup in case of emergency.
Global master control in Calgary turned the main feed around, only to realize during the show that something was not right. The feed they were running was the two-hour international version of the show, while the backup feed had the one-hour domestic version.
Global then switched feeds, catching the domestic feed in mid-song.
The network was able to show the correct feed in Saskatchewan, Alberta and B.C. where the program aired later due to the time difference.
