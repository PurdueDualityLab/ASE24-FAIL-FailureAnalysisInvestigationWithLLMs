Global Television is replaying the finale of Rock Star: Supernova tonight after a technical glitch Wednesday affected almost half the show for viewers in Mantoba and east.
In B.C., the hour-long show will air at 8 p.m.
Viewers in B.C. saw the whole show but in seven provinces fans of the popular show were seeing canned highlights of past episodes.
The error originated with CBS in Los Angeles, according to Global. 'I think it was simple human error, honestly,' said Barbara Williams, senior vice-president of programming and production.
