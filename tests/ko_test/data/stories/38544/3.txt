The fallout from a technical glitch during the Rock Star: Supernova TV finale widened yesterday as Global acknowledged the problem was more extensive than originally thought.
Because of an error in identifying the correct satellite feed, viewers in much of the country -- from Manitoba eastward -- missed almost half of the show, seeing canned highlights of past episodes instead. On Wednesday night, a Global spokesperson said only Ontario was affected.
The blunder left confused viewers across seven provinces scratching their heads in the minutes leading up to Toronto's Lukas Rossi being chosen lead singer of the band Supernova.
Global got an earful Thursday from fans of the popular show, which drew 1.4 million viewers in Canada for each of the final two episodes Tuesday and Wednesday.
'We had a huge reaction from viewers,'' said Barbara Williams, senior vice-president of programming and production for CanWest MediaWorks.
The network repeated the show in its entirety later Wednesday in Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec -- local news prevented a repeat in the Maritimes -- and plans to air it again nationally on Friday night (check local listings).
'I think it was simple human error, honestly,'' said Williams. 'The feed co-ordinator down at CBS in Los Angeles, I think, miscommunicated.''
Viewers in Manitoba and east got the international feed of the show, a two-hour version that started with a string of highlights from past episodes, instead of the one-hour domestic feed.
By the time Global realised the error, switching feeds during a commercial break, almost half of the meat of the finale had come and gone.
