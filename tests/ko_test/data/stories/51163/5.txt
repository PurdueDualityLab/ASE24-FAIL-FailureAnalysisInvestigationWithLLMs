Kaiser Kuo by Fantake via FlickrMany internet users in China were pleasantly surprised when suddenly a range of previously blocked website were available, last Friday, including the twitter-interface Hootsuite, Voice of America, video-sharing site Vimeo and URL shortening site bit.ly. Even some foreign pornography was suddenly available.
But that happiness might be shortlived, tells internet watcher Kaiser Kuoto CP:
'I think it's totally just a glitch. These things have happened often before. (Censors) screw up and some site will suddenly become available for a day or two days and then be back to normal again. There's never any rhyme or reason to it,' said Kaiser Kuo, a Beijing-based technology analyst. 'It's almost certainly not deliberate policy.'The sites have become available amid a 'sweep out pornography and prostitution' campaign in the Chinese capital of Beijing, which has resulted in the closure of several nightclubs and karaoke parlours.Commercial
