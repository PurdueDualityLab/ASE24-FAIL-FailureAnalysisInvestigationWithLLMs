TOKYO -(Dow Jones)- Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. (MC or 6752) will begin shipping its new chipsets for optical disc drives, supporting the DVD-Multi and CD-R/RW standards, this month. Products with this chipset are capable of high-speed DVD and CD recording and playback functions. The chipset retails at Y5,000.
KDDI Corp. (J.KDD or 9433) incorrectly billed about 406 customers in Tokyo for August due to a technical glitch. KDDI said it has fixed the problem, and though mistaken bills were posted Sept. 7, correct bills will be sent out immediately.
