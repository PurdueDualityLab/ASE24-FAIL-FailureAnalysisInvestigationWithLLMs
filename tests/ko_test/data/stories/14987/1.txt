BOSTON (AP) - When Shannon O'Connell left the Boston area to work for a non-profit agency in Romania, she decided to safeguard possessions with special significance in a local U-Haul storage facility.
Today, almost all those possessions are gone, auctioned by U-Haul of Boston for $400.
Now, O'Connell is suing for $1 million, alleging that after a credit card glitch, U-Haul sold virtually everything she owned without contacting her or any of the relatives she listed on her rental application.
"I've lost my entire history as a person," O'Connell told The Boston Globe, in an interview from Budapest. "Everything I ever wanted to keep is gone."
But U-Haul's insurance company said it did nothing improper.
On paper, what O'Connell lost has little monetary worth. But the items invoked memories that she said made them valuable to her.
The collection included photos of herself with President and Mrs. Clinton, Al Gore and Steven Spielberg, a signed copy of a novel by Alice Walker, and a tape of love songs from an old boyfriend, as well as her love letters and personal poetry.
There was also a wooden desk she received as a gift from a best friend, the only existing copy of her master's thesis the Fletcher School at Tufts, and her grandmother's black velvet evening dress.
Her suit states that O'Connell, 31, believed all those things were safe when she left them at U-Haul's Medford storage facility and traveled to Romania last August for two years with the National Democratic Institute, a group that advocates responsible politics in emerging democracies.
Romania's crippled infrastructure prevented her from getting mail or using phone service for months. When she came home for Christmas, she noticed U-Haul had stopped billing her credit card account for the storage. When she called, she learned the company had sold her possessions at auction to pay a past due bill of $209.10
"I was hysterical, absolutely hysterical," O'Connell said.
U-Haul denied wrongdoing, but declined further comment. A claims examiner for Republic Western Insurance Company of Warminster, Pa., said only that the company was gathering facts on the case.
O'Connell's lawyer, Frank Gaeta, said it's unclear why the credit card billings stopped. But he said U-Haul violated a state law which requires storage companies to notify "all other persons known to claim an interest" before property can be auctioned.
U-Haul sent two registered letters to O'Connell's old Somerville address, but didn't notify any of the four relatives she listed on her rental agreement, Gaeta said.
O'Connell is claiming emotional distress in the suit, saying the loss of her belongings triggered a near breakdown.
"I want the financial means to replace the things that can be replaced," she said. "And I want some justice."
