What price do you put on a lifetime of memories? Shannon O'Connell isn't sure, but she knows it's more than $400.
That's the amount theNewton native says U-Haul of Boston auctioned her belongings for in December, after an apparent credit card glitch put her storage space payments $209 in arrears.
She's now filing a $1million lawsuit alleging that, while she was working for a nonprofit group in Romania advocating democratic rights and equality for women, U-Haul sold virtually everything she owned without properly notifying her or contacting any of the relatives she had listed on her rental application. U-Haul's insurance company, meanwhile, insists that nothing improper occurred.
The 31-year-old politicalconsultant said her frantic attempt to trace her possessions netted an awful truth. A few sticks of furniture had been resold by a junk dealer in Lowell to parties unknown, and the bulk of her personal belongings - clothing, books, photographs, mememtos - had been sent to a waste facility in New Hampshire and incinerated.
"I've lost my entirehistory as a person," she said yesterday, in a telephone interview from Bucharest. "Everything I ever wanted to keep is gone."
Photographs of herselfwith President and Mrs. Clinton, Al Gore, and Steven Spielberg. Balzac first editions. A signed copy of a novel by Alice Walker. A tape of love songs from an old boyfriend, as well as all her love letters and personal poetry. A wooden writing desk she received as a gift from her best friends.
A rare photograph of herand her grandfather before he died. Every photo, in fact, that she ever took, including the negatives. A green leather-topped end table that showed the rings where her favorite great-aunt would put her glass of Scotch. The only existing copies of her master's thesis from the Fletcher School at Tufts University. A 1900 yearbook that belonged to her uncle, who was one of the first Irish Catholics to graduate from Yale University. Her grandmother's black velvet evening dress.
All of it, the lawsuitstates, plus hundreds of other personal items, were supposedly safe at U-Haul's Medford storage facility when she flew off to Eastern Europe in August for a two-year stint with the National Democratic Institute. The nonprofit group advocates responsible politics in emerging democracies.
Romania's devastatedinfrastructure made getting mail and phone service next to impossible for months, she said. It wasn't until she returned home for Christmas, she said, that she noticed U-Haul had stopped automatically billing the $60.95 monthly fee to her American Express card.
When she called to check on her things, she was told they had been sold at auction.
"I was hysterical,absolutely hysterical. They wouldn't give me any information," she said. Only after her brother-in-law, Boston lawyer Martin Mahoney, interceded did they learn that U-Haul had sold them for $400 to pay a past due bill of $209.10.
Papers filed with thelawsuit indicate that U-Haul of Boston has denied any wrongdoing. A spokesman yesterday declined comment on the matter, which is being handled by the company's insurance carrier.
Thomas Shea, a claimsexaminer for Republic Western Insurance of Warminster, Pa., said only that "the case is very new and we are gathering facts."
O'Connell's lawyer, FrankGaeta of Boston, says that the reason the credit card billings stopped is still a mystery, but he charges that U-Haul clearly violated state laws governing the disposition of property at long-term storage facilities.
The law requires that thestorage company notify the owner and "all other persons known to claim an interest" before property can be auctioned off to pay an overdue bill. U-Haul, Gaeta said, sent two registered letters, which were returned unopened, to O'Connell's old address in Somerville but failed to notify four of her relatives whose names, addresses, and telephone numbers were listed on her rental agreement, including her sister, Meghan Mahoney, who was listed as an "emergency contact."
Martin Mahoney said aU-Haul employee admitted to him that "no one had ever been called on the phone." If someone had, he said, he and his wife would have gladly "walked over and paid the bill in cash. We live less than a mile away."
The Suffolk SuperiorCourt lawsuit seeks actual damages, attorneys' fees, and compensation for emotional distress. The trauma of losing her belongings caused O'Connell to suffer "many sleepless nights, painful headaches, and near breakdowns," the lawsuit states.
"I want the financial means to replace the things that can be replaced," O'Connell said yesterday. "And I want some justice."
