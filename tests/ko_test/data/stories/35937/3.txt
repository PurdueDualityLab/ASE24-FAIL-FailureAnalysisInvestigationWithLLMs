WASHINGTON
The website for the U.S.National Security Agency, which has been under scrutiny for domestic wiretaps it conducted without warrants, was inaccessible for more than seven hours yesterday. A spokesperson, Don Weber, declined to say whether the site suffered an attack by hackers or a technical glitch. Speaking shortly after the site went back online, he said employees had worked to restore access.
