Officials say a computer glitch has caused some homeowners in Fulton County to get inaccurate tax assessment notices.
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that some homeowners are getting notices indicating they will owe thousands of dollars more in taxes even when their home values dropped.
Fulton County's chief appraiser, Burt Manning, said the problem appears to be confined to Atlanta. He said he doesn't know how widespread the problem is.
Several counties in metro Atlanta are sending out property tax assessments, many of them lower than they've been because of a decline in housing values.
Officials in Cobb County say they mailed about 230,000 notices on Friday, with 90,000 showing reductions.
DeKalb County is scheduled to send out 235,000 notices later this month. Gwinnett County mailed 256,000 residential notices last month.
