For Doug Parker, CEO of US Airways Group Inc., attempting to buy the much larger Delta Air Lines Inc. in a proposed deal last week that would create North America's biggest airline is just the latest risky bet in a long string of successful, audacious gambits. This is a man who has run with the bulls in Spain, after all, and spent a good deal of his honeymoon bungee-jumping.
Parker had the misfortune of taking charge of regional airline America West Airlines Inc. just days before the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. But with furious lobbying in Washington, he secured a U.S. government-backed loan guarantee to stave off bankruptcy protection.
And only three years of cost-cutting later, America West was healthy enough to pull off a reverse takeover of the larger US Airways, which was in bankruptcy protection at the time, and retained its name in the deal. Last Wednesday, just 18 months later, Parker tabled an $8.7 billion (U.S.) offer in another reverse takeover, of the much bigger Delta, also currently in bankruptcy protection. The combined airline would serve 350 destinations on five continents.
Parker's formula hasn't changed: Once again, the proposed new airline would take the name of the takeover prey, Parker would emerge as CEO of the enlarged Delta, and massive cost-cutting is the key to making the deal work. With Delta in bankruptcy protection since December of last year, it has the advantage of companies in the throes of bankruptcy reorganization of being able to break costly contracts for everything from aircraft leases to rental fees on airport-terminal slots.
Provided he's able to consummate a union before Delta's scheduled emergence from bankruptcy protection early next year, Parker is confident he can slash about 10 per cent of the new carrier's capacity, much of it overlapping (both airlines operate Eastern Seaboard shuttles, for instance), and carve a staggering $1.7 billion (U.S.) from the combined airline's annual operating costs.
Until now, Robert Milton of ACE Aviation Holdings Inc., parent of Air Canada, has been the model CEO for a long-anticipated airline-industry renaissance in the view of the International Air Transport Association, the industry's trade group. Milton achieved sustainability for his traditional, or 'legacy,' carrier largely by doing his bit to cut industry capacity. Air Canada absorbed ailing rival Canadian Airlines, then used aggressive pricing to force the demise of competitors Canada 3000, Jetsgo Corp., CanJet Airlines and Roots Air.
That left a duopoly, and a reduction in total industry capacity, in which both Air Canada and WestJet Airlines Ltd. are handsomely profitable. Just 26 months out of bankruptcy protection itself, Air Canada was able last week to raise about $525 million (Canadian) from investor share offerings, and this week returns to the Toronto Stock Exchange with its own listing.
In the U.S. industry, by contrast, Parker has been the only post-9/11 consolidator, with a legacy he hopes will include having removed two carriers from the scene - America West and US Airways in its current form - and a resulting, healthy reduction in industry over-capacity.
Airline mergers are notoriously difficult, given the complexity of route structures, fleets with incompatible aircraft types, and drawn-out battles over seniority rights among unionized employees. Delta, launched in 1924 in Macon, Ga. as the world's first crop-dusting service, was long among the industry's best-run carriers. It boasted above-average customer service and employee pride when, in the early 1990s, it snapped up international and domestic routes from two crippled airlines, Eastern Air Lines and Pan American World Airways (the latter having self-destructed from culture clashes after its purchase of National Airlines, a large but prosaic domestic carrier that was a poor fit with the glamourous global-route pioneer Pan Am).
Delta thus transformed itself into an ordinary carrier, saddled with a bloated aircraft fleet and route structure and a fractious workforce of employees who couldn't shake their loyalty to predecessor airlines.
And, to be sure, Parker has yet to fully integrate the old America West with US Airways. Employees of each are tussling over seniority rights as Parker tries to slash the combined airline's headcount; and customers have suffered inconvenience from glitches in the integration of websites and loyalty programs.
Yet consolidation is the only salvation for an industry that has lost more than $40 billion (U.S.) since 9/11, and is showing a net loss for investors since the Wright brothers took their first workable prototype for a test run at Kitty Hawk.
Most industry experts think the over-served U.S. market could get by with half its current dozen or so major scheduled airlines, and point to Northwest Airlines Corp. (which filed for bankruptcy protection the same day as Delta), Continental Airlines Inc. and Alaska Air Group Inc. as likely fodder in a much-needed second wave of consolidation.
As for Parker, he must run a considerable gauntlet of Delta creditors, a Delta board that is hostile to his bid, union leaders at both airlines, and the anti-trust mandarins at the U.S. Justice Department, which as recently as 2001 poured cold water on a proposed United Airlines-US Airways merger.
On that score, Parker hasn't helped his cause by reaping a pretax profit of $9 million on the sale of stock options in August. While he still has shares in US Airways, the sale was hardly a vote of confidence in US Airways stock, which Parker is using as currency in the proposed Delta deal. (He's offering Delta creditors a total of 78.5 million US Airways shares and $4 billion in cash.)
Neither has that CEO bonanza helped relations with US Airways employees, who tried to spoil Parker's Delta-bid announcement by holding an 'information picket' the next day at US Airways' hub at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. But for now, at least, employees are less likely to upset Parker's plans than Wall Street, which boosted the value of shares in both Delta and US Airways on news of the proposed merger, signaling that a bidding war might erupt for Delta. Even the anti-trust issue is a lesser worry. Discounters such as Southwest Airlines Co., JetBlue Airways Corp. and AirTran Holdings Inc. now command 25 per cent of the market, up from 18 per cent in 2001, the year that the Justice Department last blocked an airline merger, thus weakening the argument that fewer legacy carriers means less consumer choice.
Parker has to like his odds. True, airlines are at the mercy of external factors over which they have no control, like soaring fuel prices and the revelation by British authorities last August of a foiled plot to blow up 10 trans-Atlantic flights in mid-air. (That one incident cost American Airlines alone an estimated $50 million (U.S.) worth of cancelled bookings.)
But as an airline executive, Parker has at least some control over his destiny - certainly more than he enjoys as an habitue of the blackjack and craps tables in Vegas.
