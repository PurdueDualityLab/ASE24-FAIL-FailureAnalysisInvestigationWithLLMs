Bid poses management challenge

It is hard enough post-9/11 to manage one airline. Now, US Airways Chief Executive Doug Parker wants to run three.
With his $8.67 billion hostile-takeover bid last week for Delta Air Lines, the chief executive is proposing to add another company to the two he is combining as a result of his America West Airlines acquiring US Airways late last year.
The 45-year-old financial whiz is rolling the dice again in what would become the greatest management challenge of his career if a deal goes through. By merging with the much-larger Atlanta carrier Delta as it emerges from bankruptcy court, US Airways, Tempe, Arizona, would become the largest U.S. airline in terms of passenger traffic, a leap from its No. 6 ranking.
Mr. Parker would be faced with folding in an even larger airline with the two he is scrambling to integrate. Although the earlier merger is considered a financial success so far, its customer-service rankings have been at industry lows in recent months as the airline has had rising problems with baggage handling and overall service complaints. Management continues to blend the cultures of the two airlines, which were steeped in vastly different processes and procedures.
Union labor groups have yet to be combined, and pilots are griping about how throwing a third airline into the mix would further complicate the task of reassigning seniority ratings. US Airways has yet to combine the reservation systems of its predecessor airlines, a huge and sensitive task set to take place early next year. The company had glitches when it combined frequent-flier programs and launched a blended Web site in May, efforts that angered customers who couldn't complete bookings or get access to frequent-flier-mileage information as needed.
Mr. Parker is talking up the savings. A US Airways-Delta merger would cut overlapping flights and reorganize ground facilities, among other things, to bring about some $1.65 billion in annual cost savings, he said.
Increased size would be an advantage, not a burden for the airline, Mr. Parker said: "Size helps. The ability to take more people to more places is a critical factor in running an airline, so it certainly matters." The airline would have more purchasing power when it comes to buying things such as new seats for aircraft.
Still, adding Delta would bring more than 400 additional planes to schedule and maintenance, 51,000 more employees, more complex technology to integrate or overhaul, and throngs of new customers (in terms of "passenger emplanements" -- that is, a person getting onto an airplane -- Delta has 118 million a year, nearly four times that of US Airways). "Because of the immense complexity of all the moving parts, the amount of planning is the single most important factor involved" in pulling off any merger, said Peter Walsh, director of Mercer Management Consulting's global aviation, aerospace and defense practice.
Mr. Parker and his team said they would be ahead of the game in planning if the Delta acquisition goes through. In the first merger they had to create an integration plan from scratch. When they began contemplating a Delta combination months ago, they went through each operating area to assess what would be different with Delta and what didn't work in the first merger. "We've learned a lot of lessons. We'll do it better the second time around," said US Airways President Scott Kirby, who, as with his boss Mr. Parker, was an executive at America West before the merger.
One of the lessons, Mr. Parker said, comes from the airline's Philadelphia hub, acquired from the old US Airways. Baggage-handling problems and staffing shortages persisted even after Mr. Parker bought millions of dollars more in ground equipment and increased staffing. He bought more equipment and boosted staffing again.
Management also learned it needed to listen more to employees. After the launch of the new US Airway Web site, Mr. Kirby started a weekly conference call with employees from reservations, airports, and other areas to discuss customer feedback. Once a month, a dozen vice presidents go out and meet with line workers at various locations to do the same, he said.
