US Airways' brash $8 billion bid to buy Delta Air Lines won a warm reception Wednesday on Wall Street, but the proposed deal has a long way to go to get done.
US Airways' bid, immediately rebuffed by Delta management, would make the combined airline the USA's top carrier by domestic flying capacity, eclipsing American Airlines. By US Airways' own calculations, the combined carrier would be the biggest airline in the Northeast and the Southeast, the biggest carrier across the Atlantic, and the second-biggest airline in the Caribbean.
US Airways shares closed up nearly 17%, at $59.50, on strong buy recommendations from analysts. The company offered $4 billion in cash and about $4.6 billion worth of US Airways stock, which would give tens of thousands of unsecured creditors at Delta a 25% premium over the value of their claims as of Tuesday: 40 cents on the dollar. Delta filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in 2005.
"The proposal we've made is extremely compelling," US Airways CEO Doug Parker said Wednesday. But it faces several hurdles; some certain, some not.
The takeover bid would require the approval of Delta's bankruptcy judge, US Airways' shareholders, Delta's creditors and the U.S. government. And it might not be the only offer for Delta, a potentially attractive target as the USA's third-biggest carrier. Some of the hurdles:
*Delta management. Delta CEO Gerald Grinstein reiterated Wednesday his long-held position that he wants the carrier to exit bankruptcy next year as an independent airline. In its bankruptcy case, Delta has the exclusive legal right until Feb. 15 to present the court a plan of reorganization. Unless the judge terminates that right, a competing plan from Delta's creditors or an outside party can't be considered.
*Antitrust. A merger between two such big carriers needs Justice Department approval. The agency would have to determine whether the deal would help or hurt consumers in terms of fares and flight options. Antitrust considerations are particularly strong along the East Coast, where the route networks of both Delta and US Airways are heavily concentrated.
*A competing bid. Another carrier or investor group could make a competing offer for Delta, leading to a bidding war. That would force US Airways to sweeten its offer or drop out of the bidding.
United Airlines CEO Glenn Tilton, for one, has made no secret of his interest in a merger. Tilton believes that the U.S. airline industry has too many players and should consolidate. United itself emerged from bankruptcy earlier this year.
United Airlines spokeswoman Jean Medina said Wednesday the Chicago-based airline has "been consistent in our position on consolidation in the airline industry, and nothing has changed." She would not comment on the possibility of a competing offer for Delta.
* Labor. US Airways is itself the product of a recent merger between Phoenix-based America West and Virginia-based US Airways (story, above). The two carriers' labor unions and operations have not yet been fully merged. Labor tensions and operational glitches remain. A new merger could throw US Airways and Delta into a period of transition again.
"This would have to jump through many hoops," said Chicago-based bankruptcy lawyer Fruman Jacobson, who represented the unsecured creditors of United Airlines during its bankruptcy case. "It could run into some serious antitrust problems." At the same time, he said, Delta's board of directors "has an obligation to review all qualified offers. Looking at just the raw numbers, this has to be taken seriously, especially the $4 billion in cash."
Typically, unsecured creditors in a bankruptcy case receive only stock in the reorganized company as payment for claims, not cash.
New York-based lawyer Daniel Golden, who represents Delta's unsecured creditors committee, said the group was scheduled to begin discussing the offer Wednesday during a regularly scheduled meeting. The committee represents creditors such as bondholders, suppliers and vendors, whose claims are not secured by tangible assets such as aircraft.
Delta CEO Grinstein said in a statement that the company will review the offer. But he reiterated Delta's wish to emerge from bankruptcy in the first half of 2007 as a "strong, stand-alone carrier."
The proposal was not a complete surprise. Parker, the US Airways CEO, first approached Grinstein last spring with the idea of merging. In September, Parker sent a formal letter proposing such a deal.
Grinstein politely rebuffed both invitations.
US Airways' bid quickly sparked speculation about more merger activity in the domestic airline industry, which only recently began pulling out of a deep, five-year financial slump.
In addition to speculation about expansion-minded United, the Delta deal focused attention on a possible bid for Northwest Airlines, also operating in Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Analyst Ray Neidl of Calyon Securities said Wednesday the US Airways bid could be the first of many merger proposals.
"We believe that this bid may prompt other bids for Delta and possibly set an industry trend for consolidation," Neidl said.
Financing set up
To finance the offer, US Airways said it has lined up $7.2 billion in financing from Citigroup to provide the $4 billion in cash, refinance Delta's bankruptcy loan, and refinance an existing loan from GE Capital to US Airways.
But Parker said the deal makes sense only if it is sealed before Delta exits bankruptcy. While under the protection of bankruptcy court, Delta has the legal right to reject or renegotiate leases for aircraft and other assets, a powerful cost-cutting tool. US Airways estimates that by combining fleets, networks and facilities, and by eliminating redundancies, the combined airline could achieve $1.65 billion in annual cost savings.
Parker is not proposing the merged carrier close hub airports, exit cities or shed significant flying capacity. On the contrary, he said the proposed new carrier would serve the same cities the two carriers do now, including every major market along the East Coast: Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Washington, Charlotte, Atlanta and Florida's largest cities. US Airways' home base of Phoenix and Delta's Salt Lake City hub are also relatively close.
The merged carrier would reduce its combined overall flying capacity by 10%, he said.
The biggest concession Parker proposed is selling one of the two hourly shuttle services serving high-paying business travelers in the Boston-New York-Washington corridor. Delta operates one shuttle, US Airways another. Eliminating one would remove a potential objection by the Justice Department.
Legal hurdles
Parker played down concerns that the deal might be viewed as anti- competitive. "Our management has a record of consumer-friendly pricing," he said. "Consumers on the East Coast would have a stronger airline with the ability to lower fares."
Justice has approved two airline mergers in recent years involving carriers in bankruptcy court: American's takeover of TWA in 2001, when TWA was in its third bankruptcy and in danger of disappearing; and America West's merger with US Airways last year when the latter was in Chapter 11.
The old US Airways was concentrated along the East Coast, while America West was concentrated in the West, with relatively little overlap.
But Justice blocked a proposed merger of United and US Airways in 2001, saying the merged carrier would have too much overlap on the East Coast and would hinder competition.
Hewitt Pate, former Justice Department antitrust chief and now a partner at Hunton & Williams, said the department traditionally looks at airline mergers in terms of combined market share on routes they serve.
Historically, he said, Justice has been friendly to mergers that combined route systems with little overlap. It has been "skeptical of deals with a high degree of overlap where the two companies serve a lot of the same city pairs," he said.
Business professor Severin Borenstein of the University of California at Berkeley said the two carriers' nearby hubs in Atlanta and Charlotte, Cincinnati and Pittsburgh, and Salt Lake City and Phoenix could pose potential antitrust problems.
Both carriers also have a significant presence in Boston Logan, New York LaGuardia and Washington Reagan. US Airways has the largest presence in Philadelphia and Charlotte, while Delta dominates Atlanta.
"There's a fair amount of overlap in their route structures, particularly in the Southeast, and I would think that would be a problem for Washington," Borenstein said.
Borenstein noted that the USA's airline landscape has changed dramatically in the last six years. Low-cost carriers including Southwest, AirTran, Jet Blue, Frontier and Spirit now control about 25% of the domestic market.
