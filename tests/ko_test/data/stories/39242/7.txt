US Airways sees lessons in possible Delta merger

It's hard enough post-Sept. 11 to manage one airline. Now, US Airways Group Inc. Chief Executive Doug Parker wants to run three.
With his $8.67 billion hostile bid last week for Delta Air Lines, the CEO is proposing to add yet another company to the two he's already combining as a result of his America West Airlines acquiring US Airways late last year. He envisions that the new airline would fly under the Delta name.
The 45-year-old, known for his financial expertise, is rolling the dice again in what would become the greatest management challenge of his career if a deal goes through. By merging with the much-larger Atlanta carrier Delta as it emerges from bankruptcy court, US Airways, based in Tempe, Ariz., would become the largest U.S. airline in terms of passenger traffic, a huge leap from its No. 6 ranking right now.
It would add an exponential level of complexity to an already daunting task. Though the earlier merger is considered a financial success so far, some of its customer-service rankings have been among industry lows in recent months as the airline has had rising problems with baggage handling and overall service complaints. Management is still blending the cultures of the two airlines, which were in many ways steeped in vastly different processes and procedures.
Union groups have yet to be combined, and pilots are griping about how throwing a third airline into the mix would further complicate the task of reassigning seniority ratings. US Airways has yet to meld the reservation systems of its predecessor airlines, a huge and sensitive task set to occur early next year. The company had major glitches when it combined frequent-flier programs and launched a blended Web site in May, efforts that angered many customers who couldn't complete bookings or get access to frequent-flier-mileage information.
Mr. Parker, though, is talking up the savings. A US Airways-Delta merger would cut overlapping flights and reorganize ground facilities, among other things, to bring about some $1.65 billion in annual cost savings, he said.
Increased size would be an advantage, not a burden for the airline, Mr. Parker said: 'Size helps. The ability to take more people to more places is a critical factor in running an airline, so it certainly matters.' The airline would also have more purchasing power when it comes to buying things such as new seats for aircraft or cups and napkins for in-flight service.
Still, adding Delta would bring more than 400 additional planes to schedule and maintain, 51,000 more employees, more complex technology to integrate or overhaul, and throngs of new customers (in terms of 'passenger enplanements' a person getting onto an airplane Delta has about 119 million a year, nearly four times that of US Airways). 'Because of the immense complexity of all the moving parts, the amount of planning is the single most important factor involved' in pulling off any merger, said Peter Walsh, director of New York-based Mercer Management Consulting's aerospace group.
Mr. Parker and his team say they are ahead of the game in planning if the Delta acquisition goes through. In the first merger they had to create an integration plan from scratch. But when they began contemplating a Delta combination months ago, they started going through each operating area to assess what would be different with Delta and what didn't work in the first merger.
'We've learned a lot of lessons. We'll do it better the second time around,' said US Airways President Scott Kirby, who, like Mr. Parker, was an executive at America West before the merger.
One of the lessons, Mr. Parker said, comes from the airline's Philadelphia hub, acquired from the old US Airways. Baggage-handling problems and staffing shortages persisted even after Mr. Parker bought millions of dollars in ground equipment and increased staffing. He recently bought more equipment and boosted staffing again.
'It was a bigger problem than we thought,' Mr. Parker said. 'We've made huge progress over the last few months by focusing more on baggage, getting more people hired, putting more ground equipment in place. We apparently didn't go quite far enough. That is our No. 1 focus at US Airways, getting that done.'
Management also learned it needed to listen more to employees. After the problem-ridden launch of the new US Airways Web site, Mr. Kirby started a weekly conference call with employees from reservations, airports, and other areas to discuss customer feedback. Once a month, a dozen vice presidents meet with line workers at various locations to do the same.
In a Delta merger, management would move more slowly on some of the technology integrations, Mr. Kirby said. The company was blindsided by higher customer call volumes after it moved more than 10 million frequent-flier records from one airline's technology platform to another. In a Delta merger they'd do more testing in advance and bring in customers to give feedback on the Web site and help identify glitches.
Executives concede that Atlanta's airport where Delta operates a huge hub would be a bear to manage. US Airways executives say that to more efficiently manage the sprawling, busy facility, they'll likely fly larger planes from that airport, while moving smaller planes to their nearby hub in Charlotte.
One key challenge for Mr. Parker would be putting together an expanded team of managers that would include those from an airline that is still loudly opposing his bid. 'What we learned in the US Airways-America West merger is that it's extremely important to have people from both management teams working together,' he said.
When Mr. Parker was first integrating the new US Airways, he and his team came up with a list of goals he planned to share with employees. Someone from the America West side of his team suggested creating a slogan for the campaign. But managers from the old US Airways advised Mr. Parker that workers would think that was disingenuous, given that the company had made two trips through bankruptcy court and a string of promises from former managers hadn't panned out. 'There are histories in each company, and as I went out and talked to employees on the US Airways side, I had to spend a lot of time trying to understand what have they gone through, what have they heard, how am I going to sound saying that?' Mr. Parker said.
All this is likely dwarfed by the union issues posed by combining three airlines. US Airways is conducting talks with pilots groups from both its predecessor airlines, and those talks are unlikely to be completed before a merger with Delta could be consummated some time next year. That means the airline could end up conducting three-way union talks.
Mr. Parker said he plans to raise union pay scales for the combined labor groups to the highest scale paid by any of the three original airlines. Current US Airways pilots say it's not so simple, given all the seniority issues and their uncertainty whether the highest pay scales would be enough. They also want the company to complete negotiations with them before taking on another merger.
Mr. Parker said he was forced to make a move while Delta was still in bankruptcy proceedings and big cost savings could still be negotiated through the courts. 'If we could, we would have liked for this opportunity to come along a little later, so we could fully integrate our merger now,' he said.
