Mergers in the Air?: [Cincinnati Edition]

US Airways Group Inc.'s $8.67 billion hostile takeover bid for Delta Air Lines suggests that the long-predicted frenzy of consolidation among U.S. airlines may have begun.
The deal would create the biggest U.S. airline -- at least before any assets are sold off -- and bring Delta out of bankruptcy-court protection, where it has been since September 2005. Many in the industry believe airlines' financial recovery will be faster if there are fewer big carriers.
Speculation was rife about other possible mergers. UAL Corp.'s United Airlines has been interested in Continental, and American could take a look at Northwest Airlines, which is also in bankruptcy proceedings.
Jake Brace, United's chief financial officer, raised the prospect of a merger wave at an investor conference in New York. He said there is "probably no need for more than, you know, two, three, maximum four network carriers," referring to airlines with nationwide routes.
The U.S. airline industry is beginning to recover from a spate of post-9-11 bankruptcy proceedings, among them United, Northwest and Delta. US Airways itself twice filed for bankruptcy reorganization, in 2002 and 2004. Last year it was acquired by the much healthier America West Holdings. The combined airline then took the US Airways name.
Many analysts consider the US Airways-America West merger a success so far. The company has cut costs, turned a profit and boosted its stock price. That in turn has boosted the reputation of US Airways Chief Executive Doug Parker, who led America West before the merger.
Parker is known as a risk taker. He has run with the bulls in Spain, bungee-jumped on his honeymoon in New Zealand, and traveled often to Las Vegas to play blackjack and craps.
One of his most successful gambits was gunning for a federal bailout after 9-11. Mr. Parker had just been named CEO of America West, which had reorganized in bankruptcy court after the first Gulf War and was on the brink of doing so again. Mr. Parker testified before Congress that his airline was about to go under, and spent months lobbying Washington. Eventually he secured enough support from creditors to persuade a government loan board that America West deserved a government-backed loan guarantee.
The airline quickly regained health, enabling it to take another risk last year by acquiring US Airways. The combined company took advantage of merger synergies such as saving money on airport rents, and it says it will be profitable in the fourth quarter of this year.
The merger also has been plagued by customer-service problems, though. US Airways angered many customers when it introduced its combined Web site earlier this year and merged frequent-flier programs. Glitches made it impossible in some cases for customers to complete bookings or choose their seats. More recently, a conveyor belt at an international terminal in Philadelphia broke down more than five times in a week, causing delays in baggage and flights. US Airways has yet to combine the ticket reservation systems of its predecessors.
Some analysts said other airlines that aren't dealing with such difficulties might make a bid for Delta. "The first question to ask is will there be other bidders," said Philip Baggaley, a credit analyst at Standard & Poor's. One possibility: a combination of Delta with Northwest, bringing together the two big carriers still in bankruptcy protection. A spokesman for Northwest declined to comment.
Parker's best hope is to win creditors over and get them to put pressure on Delta's executives. That may be a challenge, though, because each Delta creditor has its own interest. Some creditors are angling to get as much cash as possible, while others are willing to accept stock in Delta as it emerges from bankruptcy, provided they get enough shares.
Labor unions are a further complication. Pilots, machinists and flight attendants could stymie plans by US Airways to achieve cost savings or redefine Delta's business strategy.
The US Airways bid comes as Delta was preparing for a management transition. Mr. Grinstein plans to step down as chief executive after the company exits bankruptcy, and the two top contenders to replace him are Jim Whitehurst, the 39-year-old chief operating officer, and Ed Bastian, 49, the chief financial officer. Creditors and board members have yet to reach a consensus on whether either man is right for the job.

The U.S. bankruptcy code requires that at least half of a bankrupt company's creditors by number, and two-thirds by the value of their claims, approve a restructuring plan.
Delta's managers have the exclusive right to file a reorganization plan with the bankruptcy court and with creditors until Feb. 15. Illustration
