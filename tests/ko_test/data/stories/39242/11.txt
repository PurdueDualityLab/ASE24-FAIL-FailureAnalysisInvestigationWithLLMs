Flying Together: Surprise Hostile Bid for Delta May Spur Airline Merger Wave; US Airways Plan Would Create Top U.S. Carrier but Faces Management Opposition; Mr. Grinstein's Defiant Letter

US Airways Group Inc.'s $8.67 billion hostile takeover bid for Delta Air Lines suggests that the long-predicted frenzy of consolidation among U.S. airlines may have begun.
The deal would create the biggest U.S. airline -- at least before any assets are sold off -- and bring Delta out of bankruptcy-court protection, where it has been since September 2005. Many in the industry believe airlines' financial recovery will be faster if there are fewer big carriers.
Airline stocks surged, with the share prices of American Airlines parent AMR Corp. and Continental Airlines reaching their highest levels since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Speculation was rife about other possible mergers. UAL Corp.'s United Airlines has been interested in Continental, and American could take a look at Northwest Airlines, which is also in bankruptcy proceedings.
The US Airways-Delta deal is hardly a sure bet. Delta Chief Executive Gerald Grinstein, who was getting dressed for work when he heard a radio report about the bid, repeated yesterday that Delta wants to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings by itself. US Airways will need broad support from Delta creditors and the approval of federal antitrust authorities, who may be concerned about the two airlines' tight grip in markets up and down the East Coast. If competition decreases in those markets, consumers could see increased fares.
It's difficult enough to buy a company against the wishes of management, and the complications multiply when that company is in bankruptcy court. The bankruptcy code requires that at least half the creditors by number, and two-thirds by the value of their claims, approve a restructuring plan. What's more, until Feb. 15 Delta's managers have the exclusive right to file a reorganization plan with the bankruptcy court and with creditors. Some bankruptcy lawyers said they have rarely seen a bid like the one by US Airways.
Mr. Grinstein of Delta is nonetheless under pressure to show creditors he can give them a better deal. "Delta is going to have to . . . come up with a plan that is better than what US Airways laid out on the table," said John Penn, a bankruptcy attorney at Dallas law firm Haynes & Boone LLP.
The euphoric market reaction to US Airways' surprise announcement heightens the pressure on Delta management. Traders drove up US Airways shares nearly 17% yesterday on hopes that it can strike a deal with Delta -- an unusual rise for a potential acquirer that showed investors are heartened by the potential for fewer big carriers and less capacity.
Jake Brace, United's chief financial officer, raised the prospect of a merger wave at an investor conference in New York. He said there is "probably no need for more than, you know, two, three, maximum four network carriers," referring to airlines with nationwide routes.
The U.S. airline industry is beginning to recover from a spate of post-9/11 bankruptcy proceedings, among them United, Northwest and Delta. US Airways itself twice filed for bankruptcy reorganization, in 2002 and 2004. Last year it was acquired by the much healthier America West Holdings. The combined airline then took the US Airways name.
Many analysts consider the US Airways-America West merger a success so far. The company has cut costs, turned a profit and boosted its stock price. That in turn has boosted the reputation of US Airways Chief Executive Doug Parker, who led America West before the merger.
Mr. Parker said his offer for Delta represents a "significant premium." He warned that more than half of the expected $1.65 billion in annual cost savings could disappear if US Airways has to wait until Delta completes its bankruptcy restructuring. That's because companies in bankruptcy have greater leverage to break unfavorable leases on aircraft and airport facilities.
It isn't the first time Mr. Parker has made a move on Delta. He called Mr. Grinstein in late spring to suggest talks, but the Delta chief wasn't interested. Mr. Parker tried again in September with a letter laying out the merits of a merger. Mr. Grinstein shared the letter with his board and with the Delta creditors' committee. They agreed that the combination raised too many issues, including potential antitrust barriers and the challenge of merging the two airlines' planes and work forces, according to people familiar with the situation.
In October, Mr. Grinstein sent Mr. Parker a terse and defiant letter. "We will determine if and when it would be in the interests of our stakeholders to initiate discussions regarding possible extraordinary transactions with third parties," Mr. Grinstein wrote.
Yesterday Mr. Parker returned the volley, faxing his hostile takeover bid to Mr. Grinstein's office before the workday began and taking many analysts by surprise.
Mr. Grinstein didn't budge. "Delta's plan has always been to emerge from bankruptcy in the first half of 2007 as a strong, stand-alone carrier," he said in a statement. He added in a memorandum to employees: "While Delta is obligated to review this proposal carefully, we remain skeptical that it would make sense to deviate from our plan." For his part, Mr. Parker said he hopes to meet soon with Delta's creditors to press his case.
Mr. Parker is known as a risk taker. He has run with the bulls in Spain, bungee-jumped on his honeymoon in New Zealand, and traveled often to Las Vegas to play blackjack and craps.
One of his most successful gambits was gunning for a federal bailout after 9/11. Mr. Parker had just been named CEO of America West, which had reorganized in bankruptcy court after the first Gulf War and was on the brink of doing so again. Mr. Parker testified before Congress that his airline was about to go under, and spent months lobbying Washington. Eventually he secured enough support from creditors to persuade a government loan board that America West deserved a government-backed loan guarantee.
The airline quickly regained health, enabling it to take another risk last year by acquiring US Airways. The combined company took advantage of merger synergies such as saving money on airport rents, and it says it will be profitable in the fourth quarter of this year.
But the merger also has been plagued by customer-service problems. US Airways angered many customers when it introduced its combined Web site earlier this year and merged frequent-flier programs. Glitches made it impossible in some cases for customers to complete bookings or choose their seats. More recently, a conveyor belt at an international terminal in Philadelphia broke down more than five times in a week, causing delays in baggage and flights. US Airways has yet to combine the ticket reservation systems of its predecessors.
Some analysts said other airlines that aren't dealing with such difficulties might make a bid for Delta. "The first question to ask is will there be other bidders," said Philip Baggaley, a credit analyst at Standard & Poor's. One possibility: a combination of Delta with Northwest, bringing together the two big carriers still in bankruptcy protection. A spokesman for Northwest declined to comment.
US Airways is offering $4 billion in cash and 78.5 million of its shares, valued at $4.67 billion as of yesterday's close, for all shares in a future Delta that would emerge from bankruptcy proceedings. Analysts estimated that creditors would receive on average 50 cents for every dollar of debt. Delta's unsecured bonds, which recently traded at around 40 cents on the dollar, surged yesterday above the 50-cent level. Mr. Parker said the bond-price move is "a pretty strong indicator that a lot of creditors think this is a preferred alternative to the stand-alone" option.
Mr. Parker said the combined airline would be called Delta. US Airways said the new company would shed about 10% of its combined capacity, but would keep the existing US Airways and Delta hubs and major operations. That would please workers and city officials but might represent a missed opportunity for efficiencies. Delta's top hub in Atlanta is fairly near a big US Airways hub in Charlotte, N.C.
Mr. Parker's best hope is to win over creditors and get them to put pressure on Delta's executives. That may be a challenge, though, because each Delta creditor has its own interest. Some creditors are angling to get as much cash as possible, while others are willing to accept stock in Delta as it emerges from bankruptcy, provided they get enough shares.
Labor unions are a further complication. Pilots, machinists and flight attendants could stymie plans by US Airways to achieve cost savings or redefine Delta's business strategy.
The US Airways bid comes as Delta was preparing for a management transition. Mr. Grinstein plans to step down as chief executive after the company exits bankruptcy, and the two top contenders to replace him are Jim Whitehurst, the 39-year-old chief operating officer, and Ed Bastian, 49, the chief financial officer. Creditors and board members have yet to reach a consensus on whether either man is right for the job.
Mr. Grinstein has campaigned strongly on behalf of Messrs. Whitehurst and Bastian, and in recent months creditors have come around. That could make Mr. Parker's star power less of a factor than it may have been had he approached Delta at the start of 2006.
The proposed merger is likely to face scrutiny in Congress. The incoming Democratic chairman of the House Transportation Committee, Rep. Jim Oberstar of Minnesota, said yesterday that he would urge the Justice Department to conduct an antitrust review if the proposal moves forward. He said he is likely to hold hearings on the impact of the consolidation on airfares and service to small communities.
"A combination of carriers of this magnitude should be scrutinized in the public domain," said Rep. Oberstar. "Mergers reduce opportunity for competition and thereby increase costs to travelers."
Rep. Oberstar was also a vocal opponent of the proposed 2000 merger of US Airways and United Airlines. That plan fell apart after facing objections from the Justice Department. Congress has no formal role in approving proposed mergers but lawmakers can apply pressure on federal authorities.
A Justice Department spokeswoman said the department is preparing to review the proposed transaction. One factor that might work in Mr. Parker's favor: Low-cost carriers such as Southwest Airlines have a bigger chunk of the market today, potentially defusing the argument that consumers will be hurt by a US Airways-Delta combination. Low- cost airlines carry 25% of all domestic passengers today, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, up from 18% in 2000.
