SBC to Give PCs to Internet Customers --- Move Is Aimed at Boosting Usage of DSL Lines; 2-Year Pact Is Required

SBC Communications Inc. plans to give personal computers to customers who sign a two-year contract for its high-speed Internet service, aiming to boost usage of superfast digital subscriber line, or DSL, phone lines.
San Antonio-based SBC, which is deploying DSL throughout its region, said it plans to charge consumers about $60 a month for the entire package. That includes a new Compaq desktop computer preinstalled with a DSL modem and SBC's Internet access service. Users also have to pay a $198 shipping and handling charge for the computer. DSL is a technology that uses jazzed-up copper telephone lines to transmit data, including Internet connections, at speeds as much as 100 times as fast as traditional dial-up services.
The promotion, a first for a Bell, is expected to be announced today. It will be available through August to SBC customers in six states, including California, Texas and Oklahoma. The company plans to expand the promotion to other states later.
The Bells and cable-TV companies are racing to sign up Internet clients. Many have slashed prices and waived equipment and installation fees to lure customers.
Most companies, including SBC, normally charge about $40 per month for fast, always-on Internet links. Last week, Verizon Communications Inc., the new name adopted by Bell Atlantic Corp., lowered its DSL price to $40 a month from $50. A number of other companies offer almost-free PCs if a customer signs up for Internet access or cashes in rebates.
Customers who sign up for the new SBC deal will receive a 566-megahertz Compaq Presario PC with an Intel Celeron processor, a CD-ROM drive, a 10-gigabyte hard drive and unlimited Internet access. The setup normally retails for about $1,000, said Dave Gallemore, SBC's executive vice president of strategic marketing and planning.
Mike Larson, a senior vice president at Compaq Computer Corp., said the Houston company expects to sell "several hundred thousand" PCs to SBC. Industry observers said SBC is probably paying about $600 for each computer.
The marketing push is the latest in a series of aggressive steps by SBC to sign up customers for DSL. Last week, SBC unveiled a DSL self-installation kit. Today it plans to announce that it will charge $150 -- an increase of $50 -- for home installations by SBC technicians in areas where self-install kits are available.
While SBC's latest promotion will likely attract more users, it is primarily aimed at helping SBC overcome some installation glitches that have plagued DSL rollout.
SBC and others are struggling to keep up with demand for DSL as the number of requests outpaces the technicians able to install the service quickly. SBC says it is installing about 3,500 DSL lines a day. Each installation can take several hours and sometimes requires multiple visits to a customer's home. That can significantly drive up labor costs for SBC. By going the self-install route, SBC is hoping to ease some of that burden.
As SBC and the other Bells continue to push hard on DSL, small competitors are complaining that they are being pushed out altogether.
Indeed, DSL upstarts have long insisted that the Bells deliberately try to slow them down. A few of these companies said that while cooperation has improved, problems remain. "Everything that we need from them is slow and painful," said Jeffrey Blumenfeld, general counsel for Rhythms NetConnections Inc., Englewood, Colo.
Rivals said the Bells are slow to respond to requests for nearly everything -- from customer-order processing to timely access to their networks. Most DSL upstarts lease Bell lines and resell services under their own names. They depend on the Bells for space inside their central switching offices, where calls are routed and sorted, and to install DSL-ready phone lines quickly. Under federal law, the Bells must treat rivals equitably.
Even so, some DSL providers said the Bells just aren't concerned about their business needs.
Rhythms and Covad Communications Group Inc., among others, said the Bells install phone lines faster for their own customers than they do for anybody else. "I think that in any judgment of where resources go, they prefer their own," Mr. Blumenfeld said.
On average, it takes the Bells five to 15 days to provide a DSL phone line to Covad, said General Counsel Dhruv Khanna. That is down from 10 to 30 days a year earlier, he said, but still not as good as it should be -- or as fast as the Bells provide lines for their own clients. "Their performance has improved over time, but it's still not up to snuff," Mr. Khanna said.
Customers who order DSL from smaller companies can be in for a long wait -- installation can take weeks or even months. This sometimes leads to finger-pointing between the Bells and their competitors, and customers can get stuck in the middle.
Concentric Networks, an Internet service provider purchased by NextLink Communications Inc., also has some complaints. In the Northeast, served by Verizon, getting service "has been particularly challenging," said Mark Fisher, senior vice president of marketing. Even so, he said, things seem to be getting better, and Verizon has been working with the company to resolve issues.
Covad and Rhythms said they expect cooperation to improve significantly this fall, when a federal "line sharing" requirement goes into effect. This change, instituted by the Federal Communications Commission, will largely eliminate the need for technicians to coordinate DSL work with the Bells.
Verizon acknowledged that there have been problems, but said its relations with most competitors are good, and that the company is complying with the law. A Verizon spokeswoman said most problems stem from "miscommunication" with carriers. Things haven't been made any easier, she said, by the difficult task of dealing with dozens of new companies that lack resources and expertise to connect with Verizon's network.
