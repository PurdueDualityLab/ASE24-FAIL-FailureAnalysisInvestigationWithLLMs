Dial-up modems have long been the barrier separating today's Internet hype from Internet reality.
Sleek technologies such as streaming media and online video games have dominated the headlines, but it is the likes of e-mail and plain-text chat that account for most of users' time online. One reason is that the vast majority of home users remain stuck in the information superhighway's slow lane, using analog modems that make Web wonders such as downloading MP3 music files an exercise in cyber-masochism.
Until late in the past year, DSL and cable modems were little more than a big tease. Both high-speed technologies were available for only a handful of home users. At last, the times are changing. In the U.S., phone and cable-television companies, spurred by a number of smaller competitors and rival technologies, are finally taking steps to roll out their services on a nation-wide scale.
Neither DSL nor cable-modem technology is anywhere near perfect yet. Technical glitches and service issues remain, and demand so outstrips supply that prices aren't likely to come down for some time. Moreover, a high-speed connection won't bypass all of the Internet's bottlenecks, like a popular Web site or the limitations of a slow personal computer. But in city after city in the U.S., the dark ages of the dial-up modem are definitely passing.
Cable-TV companies offer cable modems, which use the network of coaxial cables that bring suites of TV channels into the home to deliver super-fast Internet connections. Telephone companies, meanwhile, offer digital subscriber line, or DSL, which uses sophisticated electronics to push a wealth of data down your regular phone line, without tying up the line, so it can be used to make a call.
Technically, the chief difference between the two is that a cable-modem line is shared by all the users of a so-called node, into which a cable company divides its network. (A user's communications are encrypted to guard them from online eavesdroppers.) However, when more users are using the service, there is less capacity available per user, and the service slows. A DSL connection, on the other hand, isn't shared, so speeds should remain constant. How much speed users get depends on their distance from phone-company central offices and the quirks of an individual line.
In the marketplace, much has been made of the differences between the two technologies. The regional U.S. phone companies have warned of the horrors of sharing a node with so-called cable-modem hogs, while the cable companies deride DSL as a jury-rigged technology. But if you've been using a dial-up modem, the much higher speeds offered by either service will seem like a godsend.
One important difference between broadband and dial-up connections is that with broadband, your high-speed connections typically remain "on." This is convenient, but it also poses a small security risk: A favorite hacker trick is to run programs that roam the Internet probing computers' connections in search of vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
Michael Harris, principal analyst for Kinetic Strategies Inc., a Phoenix market-research firm, says both the phone and cable-TV industries are worried about addressing the issue head-on for fear of spooking potential customers.
Both industries tell users how to disable file-and print-sharing capabilities -- a security hole for PCs -- but Mr. Harris and other experts still recommend that broadband users spend the $40 or so it costs to buy and install a personal firewall program. (High-speed connections make downloading the software from the Internet easy.) As for the cost of broadband services, the phone and cable-TV companies are still tinkering with pricing.
A cable modem will let you download information at more than 35 times the top speed of the fastest dial-up modem. And that's far from a cable modem's top speed: some companies limit the available download speed to keep greedy Web users from overwhelming the system.
Currently only a handful of companies offer broadband service. But Jupiter Communications, a New York market-research firm, estimates 2.8 million North American households will have cable modems by the end of year, with an additional one million or so DSL households. And there is still considerable room for growth: More than 48 million North American homes have cable-modem service available to them, while about half as many homes are within reach of DSL service from Bell Atlantic Corp., SBC Communications Inc. and BellSouth Corp. By 2003, Jupiter estimates, 7.7 million households will use cable modems, compared with 5.7 million households for DSL.
Of the companies that offer cable-modem service, RoadRunner and Excite At Home Corp. dominate the landscape. RoadRunner, based in Virginia, is controlled jointly by Time Warner Inc. and MediaOne Group Inc., which is being acquired by AT&T Corp. Under the RoadRunner model, local cable companies - including Time Warner Cable of New York - market and install the service and maintain local networks, while the national office maintains the venture's national network, which connects all the local networks.
On the DSL side, the regional U.S. phone companies are being pursued by a plethora of smaller DSL companies that have sprung up.
