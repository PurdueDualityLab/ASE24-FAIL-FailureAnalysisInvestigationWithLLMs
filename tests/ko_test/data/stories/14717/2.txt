Pacific Bell Offers Free PC to Customers with DSL Internet Connection

Pacific Bell is betting it can bring DSL to the masses through a time-honored marketing ploy: toss in a computer with the offer.
The telephone company on Monday launched a plan to offer DSL, a high-speed Internet connection, for about $ 60 a month. People who sign up for the service and agree to take Pac Bell's DSL product along with Internet services from Prodigy Communications Corp. for two years get a Compaq Presario personal computer. Customers pay $ 198 for shipping and handling of the PC.
'This sounds like a good deal,' said Kathie Hackler, a analyst with Dataquest, a Silicon Valley market researcher. 'We'll see more of these kinds of bundled offers.'
Pac Bell's basic DSL service costs about $ 40 a month, as well as $ 150 for installation and $ 99 for equipment. This also requires a two-year commitment.
DSL, along with cable modem connections, is one of the two major technologies to connect individuals and businesses to the Internet at high speeds.
Perhaps the big question is whether Pac Bell and its parent, Texas-based Baby Bell SBC Communications Inc., can actually keep up with the potential demand for the DSL- PC offering.
'The thing I would be wary of with this offer is it could be too successful,' said Eric Rasmussen, a senior consultant with the Denver office of TeleChoice Inc., a market research firm. 'There is a lag time from when the customer orders it to when it is installed. They don't have enough technicians and installers.'
Pacific Bell has struggled to install DSL service on a timely basis, according to consumer complaints. Some customers have also suffered glitches during and after the installation. And at times, Pac Bell has limited the speed for certain functions, such as Internet newsgroups, to about the same speed as conventional modems.
'We are taking aggressive steps to greatly increase installation capacity,' said Michael Coe, a spokesman for San Antonio-based SBC. Coe noted SBC and Pac Bell are hiring more installers and are offering kits so people can install DSL services on their own without having to wait for a technician.
The new service also could address that problem. The computer comes equipped with a DSL modem and necessary network connections. The customer's primary technical work, beyond the basic expertise of setting up any computer in the home, comes with the installation of a special filter that connects to the telephone cord and the phone jack in the wall.
'A lot of folks just don't have the wherewithal to buy a PC and make DSL work,' said Rob Enderle, a senior analyst with Giga Information Group in Santa Clara. 'This lowers the cost threshold and to some extent lowers the difficulty threshold. And that's what you really want.'
Still, DSL suffers other technical limitations. Customers have to be within three miles of the phone company's central switching office to be able to receive DSL service. And sometimes the phone connections in a structure aren't robust enough to handle the high-speed data flow. Only about 50 percent of the homes in a given area are capable of getting DSL, analysts say.
The service also could appeal to consumers who have a relatively slow PC.
'It could be great if you had an older computer,' Hackler said. 'You could give the older computer to somebody else in the house and use the free computer for your high-speed connections.'
Despite Pacific Bell's floundering with some aspects of its DSL service, industry insiders believe the company could have a hot commodity this time.
'The offer to bundle a PC with DSL residential service is pretty ground-breaking,' Rasmussen said. 'Nobody has done this so far.'
