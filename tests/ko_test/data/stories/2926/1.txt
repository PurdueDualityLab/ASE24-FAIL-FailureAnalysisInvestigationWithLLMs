JOHN HOLLIMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Discovery's crew planned a quick three-hour spacewalk to put some protective blankets around damaged pieces of insulation on the Hubble space telescope, and they conducted it by the numbers.

HOLLIMAN (voice-over): Telescope ground managers at the Goddard Space Flight Center were testing the telescope's parts, including the four reaction wheel assemblies which keep Hubble steady as it looks at the universe.

The reaction wheel came up to speed, and the crew got the word just before bed they wouldn't get to go outside for a sixth time.
