After lifting bulkyinstruments during their first spacewalk, astronauts Mark Lee and Steve Smith were to take on a smaller job when they tackle the Hubble telescope again Friday night.
If there were no hitchesduring a second spacewalk early Friday morning, the third spacewalk in the space shuttle Discovery's mission to upgrade the $1.6 billion Hubble Space Telescope would start at 10:20 p.m.
In Friday's spacewalk,Lee and Smith were to concentrate on replacing three balky internal parts of the telescope that help computers talk to each other, record science data and move Hubble around.
During their firstspacewalk early Friday, they installed two refrigerator-sized pieces of scientific equipment to help expand Hubble's view of the universe. The equipment, an infrared camera system and a device called a spectrometer, were given a clean bill of health Friday.
"The Hubble SpaceTelescope has a lot more muscle than it did before," Hubble scientist David Leckron said after the first spacewalk.
The work has not been glitch-free, however.
There were enoughproblems in Friday's six-hour, 42-minute spacewalk that astronaut Joe Tanner, who managed the operation from inside Discovery, apologized for making the work "more exciting" than planned.
Lee and Smith waited inthe air lock nearly two hours because one of Hubble's two huge solar panels suddenly shifted. NASA blamed the problem on Discovery's new external air lock, a tunnel where astronauts wait before leaving the ship. When air was released to depressurize the tunnel, it blew the solar panel out of position. There was no damage.
Later, Lee and Smith had ahard time closing Hubble's doors when they were finished. Some small bolts wouldn't lock the doors in position. They had to be screwed in by hand, extending the spacewalk 42 minutes.
Adding to thecomplications, paint on the handrail of Discovery's cargo bay kept coming off on Lee's glove, posing a contamination threat to Hubble.
Despite the problems, NASA's lead flight director, Jeff Bantle, said the first spacewalk was a success.
Friday evening, Lee andSmith's chores were to require a lot of intricate work with their hands, a difficult task because of the thick gloves they wear.
The most crucial part tobe replaced is called a data interface unit that sometimes stops working. Hubble has four of these microwave oven-sized units, which let the telescope's computer systems talk to each other.
Lee was to install thenew unit, a job that requires 20 different wire connections and lots of precise hand work. Each of those connections has several small pins that Lee has to keep track of.
Then, Smith was toreplace a reel-to-reel data tape recorder with a new higher-capacity recorder. Also, he'll replace a reaction wheel assembly that recently started malfunctioning. Hubble has four of these wheels, which work in concert to move the telescope.
