Shuttle astronauts start third spacewalk.

JOHNSON SPACE CENTRE, Texas, Feb 15 (Reuter) - The crew of the shuttle Discovery went to work on the Hubble Space Telescope for the third consecutive night on Saturday, as NASA managers searched for ways to patch up it's torn and tattered exterior.
Astronauts Mark Lee and Steve Smith ventured into the shuttle's open cargo bay at 10:10 p.m. EST (0310 GMT Sunday) to replace three more ageing compartments as part of the telescope's $350 million renovation.
The start of the spacewalk was held up briefly by a glitch with the computer on Lee's $10.4 million spacesuit. After the device was restarted it appeared to work properly and the 44-year-old astronaut was eager to start work.
"Unless my suit is going to fall apart, I think we need to get going here," he said.
During the six-hour spacewalk the two men planned to tackle a tricky swap out of an electronic box, involving intricate wiring work, the installation of a new digital tape recorder and the replacement of a flywheel device used to manoeuvre the observatory.
Earlier on Saturday, during the second spacewalk of the mission, astronauts Greg Harbaugh and Joe Tanner replaced an ageing guidance sensor with one fitted with special optics to correct for Hubble's misshapen mirror.
David Leckrone, Hubble senior project scientist, compared the accuracy of the new sensor to being able to hit a golf ball in Washington D.C. and score a hole-in-one in Denver, Colorado.
"They're very precise, very complex optical instruments and we're absolutely dependent on them to do science," he said.
The $8 million device would determine the position of stars about 10 times more precisely than ground-based telescopes. Astronomers also hoped to use it to detect tiny wobbles in the motion of nearby stars that might indicate the presence of an orbiting planet.
The astronauts also tackled the replacement of a broken tape recorder and a quick wiring job for the new guidance sensor before returning to the shuttle's airlock.
The second spacewalk lasted just more than seven hours, longer than expected, partly because mission control ordered additional inspections of Hubble's tattered and tarnished exterior.
The astronauts reported that the harsh environment of space had taken its toll on Hubble. They found paint was discoloured and in places silvery insulation foil was torn and peeling away from the telescope's skin.
"In several places it's cracked. It's just gotten old, it looks like," Harbaugh radioed mission control. Some of the tears appeared 18 inches (45 cm) long. "They're not just tiny little spider cracks."
The wear and tear was not present when astronauts first visited the telescope in 1993 to fix its blurred vision.
"We did not see anything like this," veteran astronaut Story Musgrave, who led the spacewalks on that mission, said.
Mission managers formed a team of engineers to consider ways of repairing the foil, the first of up to 20 layers of material that protect the telescope from harsh temperature changes.
"The specific concern is if that starts breaking off then it could contaminate the optics and then degrade the capabilities of the telescope," said astronaut Jerry Ross, who watched the spacewalks from mission control.
Lee and Smith were to try out ways of patching up Hubble's torn and tattered outer skin. NASA managers hope to make some repairs to rips during the fourth spacewalk, scheduled for Sunday night.
Numerous space debris hits were spotted on the telescope's 40-ft (12-metre) long electricity-generating solar panels.
"That's like somebody shot a small calibre bullet right through it," Tanner said as he videotaped one hole in the solar cells.
One of the astronauts' final tasks of the day was to gently nudge Hubble two miles higher with a 20-minute series of bursts from the shuttle's precision manoeuvring jets. Later on Saturday, the shuttle's orbit was boosted a further half-mile as a precaution to avoid a passing chunk of space debris.
NASA wanted to boost the telescope's altitude by about five miles to prolong its lifetime. Further jet firings were planned over the next two days.
Flight controllers at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Centre reported the two new scientific instruments installed on Friday during the first spacewalk of the mission appeared to be working properly. It would be about 10 weeks, however, before astronomers expected to get the first images and data.
