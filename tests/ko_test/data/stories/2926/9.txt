JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, Texas, Feb 15 (Reuter) - NASA's Hubble service crew went to work on the space telescope for a third consecutive night on Saturday, trying to replace three more worn out components.
Mark Lee and Steve Smith crawled through shuttle Discovery's airlock hatch at about 10:10 p.m. EST (0310 GMT on Sunday) as the shuttle orbited 360 miles above the west coast of Australia.
The spacewalk was held up briefly by a glitch with the computer on Lee's spacesuit. After restarting the device it seemed to work properly and the 44-year-old astronaut was eager to start work.
"Unless my suit is going to fall apart, I think we need to get going here," he said.
During the six-hour spacewalk the two men planned to try a tricky swap out of an electronic box involving intricate wiring work, the installation of a new digital tape recorder and the installation of a flywheel device used to maneuver the observatory.
The astronauts will also try out ways to patch up Hubble's torn and tattered outer skin. NASA managers hope to make some repairs to rips in the silvery foil that protects the telescope from the harsh temperatures of space.
