SPACE CENTRE, Houston(AP) - Carrying a crew of seven and the Hubble Telescope, space shuttle Discovery fled to a safer, higher orbit yesterday to avoid a piece of space junk the size of a book.
The fragment of anexploded rocket would have come dangerously close to Discovery and the telescope anchored in its cargo bay, had the pilots not steered out of the way.
Hours later, astronautsMark Lee and Steven Smith went into open space to install three new Hubble parts, relatively small components requiring intensive hand work.
The start of the spacewalk was held up briefly by a glitch with the computer on Lee's $10.4 million U.S. spacesuit.
NASA, meanwhile, was considering an emergency facelift for the telescope, which has been in space for seven years.
Astronauts Friday nightdiscovered a surprising number of cracks and tears in Hubble's thin, outer insulation, as well as holes punched into the solar panels by micrometeoroids.
Most of the damage seems to have occurred since the 1993 repair mission.
The astronauts may be asked to patch the foil insulation during their final spacewalk tonight.
NASA wants to keep the $2 billion telescope flying until at least 2005.
