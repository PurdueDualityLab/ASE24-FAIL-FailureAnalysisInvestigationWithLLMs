Hubble ready for release; sixth spacewalk unnecessary

SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) - Equipped with far-seeing new eyes and its sun-wrinkled skin smoothed out, the Hubble Space Telescope was ready to be released into free flight to resume its spectacular photographic survey of the heavens.
A last-minute "glitch" on a steering component of the telescope was not a problem after all, and officials ordered the shuttle to take the Hubble to an orbit nine miles higher to decrease the chance that the atmosphere would drag it down.
The release of the spacecraft from the shuttle repair platform was set for 1:41 a.m. EST Wednesday.
Early today, two spacewalkers finished fixing Hubble's insulating cover, which had been damaged by extreme temperature changes.
Until the steering component was declared healthy, there was a possibility that an unprecedented sixth spacewalk was needed to replace it with a spare. But after three hours of tests, Mission Control determined the part - a reaction wheel - was OK.
The telescope is steered by four spinning wheels that, when brakes are applied selectively, transfer the momentum to move the 43-foot-high spacecraft.
Engineers at the Goddard Space Center in Maryland were putting the reaction wheels through their paces when one of them gave trouble.
"That reaction wheel is hardly rotating," Mission Control's Jeff Hoffman told the astronauts. "They're a little bit concerned there might be a problem."
After the tests, however, engineers said the suspect wheel was running normally. They recalled it had similar start-up problems three years ago when another crew serviced the orbiting telescope.
One of the reaction wheels was replaced earlier in the Hubble servicing mission, but it was a different one. The telescope could operate with only three of the devices, but NASA is loath to launch spacecraft when a possible problem is known.
Mark Lee and Steven Smith had just finished fixing Hubble's torn insulating cover early today when the problem surfaced. Mission Control had them go into the shuttle airlock, a compartment between the pressurized cabin and open space, and wait for a decision.
A few minutes later, Lee and Smith were told to stow away all gear in the cargo bay and end their spacewalk for the night.
They were in the cargo bay 5 hours, 17 minutes. Together with a second team of Gregory Harbaugh and Joe Tanner, the Discovery crew racked up a total of 33 hours, 11 minutes spacewalking time on the five excursions, not a record.
On today's spacewalk, Lee and Smith hung quiltlike patches over rips in the covers on three compartment doors, the last act before sending the Hubble out for another three-year tour.
When it is released back to free flight, the Hubble will operate with $347 million worth of new or upgraded parts and insulation patches to keep its extensive electronics comfortable. The most promising changes are a new infrared camera and a spectrometer, each costing more than $100 million.
The fifth spacewalk was added after NASA officials saw the deterioration on the telescope's insulation, caused by the sun and constant changing from the extreme heat of daylight to the equally extreme cold of darkness.
Lee and Smith fastened six 9-inch-by-16-inch patches with bits of foil, wire, clips, plastic twists and parachute cord - procedures worked out on the ground in NASA's can-do tradition.
The shuttle's video cameras were used to document the 2 1/2 hour task. The videos will be studied and more permanent fixes will be developed by the time a shuttle visits the Hubble again in late 1999. A fourth servicing mission is planned for 2002.
