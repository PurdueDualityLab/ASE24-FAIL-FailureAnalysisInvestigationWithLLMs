The following editorial appeared in the Orange County Register on Feb. 19:
It is possible to be appalled at the $ 2 billion cost, to be simultaneously vexed and encouraged that shuttle astronauts turned to something like baling wire and chewing gum to repair an insulation shield.
It is possible to argue that if we had boldly privatized space exploration 20 or 30 years ago, the enterprise would be farther along, having cost less and with all costs borne by people with a real interest. And the Hubble Space Telescope would have been done right the first time.
But it is almost impossible not to be impressed by what the latest repair and upgrading of the Hubble Space Telescope implies about the limits _ or lack of limits _ of the human enterprise.
Some philosophers may brood about the end of science, grumping that all the great breakthroughs have been made and there's nothing left for the future but filling in mostly predictable details.
Bosh! The Hubble Telescope, for all the glitches that have accompanied its history, promises the possibility of training real science _ something quite close to direct observation rather than speculation _ on the origins of the universe, a question that continues to fascinate humankind after millennia of observation and wondering. And whether it does that or not, it has already furnished some of the most direct, unfiltered and uncluttered views of the cosmos yet, views that offered a few surprises.
We humans might not be very good yet at figuring out the optimal way of getting things done. But we muddle through, get a few things accomplished and maybe, just maybe, we're learning.
A project like the Hubble Space Telescope, being upgraded and improved in its ninth year in orbit out in space, makes you think that this species might just have a future.
