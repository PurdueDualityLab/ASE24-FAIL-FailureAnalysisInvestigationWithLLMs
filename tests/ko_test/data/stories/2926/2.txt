SAN JOSE MAN GOES OUT OF THIS WORLD TO FULFILL BOYHOOD DREAM

Steve Smith's next business trip will find him floating in space on a tether thinner than your telephone cord.
In the continuing boy's-dreams-come-true saga that is his career, the 38-year-old astronaut from San Jose is scheduled to spacewalk for the first time on a 10-day space shuttle Discovery mission set for liftoff Tuesday.
'Flying in space is an answer to a lot of dreams,' Smith said. 'To add to that, a spacewalk is just doubly unbelievable.'
Smith's first assignment on the space shuttle Endeavour in 1994 was a joy ride, the culmination of years of yearning, preparation and five applications to the space program. Of course, there was the strenuous training and the need for him to execute his tasks as a mission specialist with pinpoint precision.
And as always, there were the attendant risks, underlined when the original liftoff was scrubbed when the main engines shut down just 1.9 seconds before launch. But he could celebrate becoming the 200th American and first person from San Jose in space.
Pressures enough to stagger mere mortals - and maybe even an astronaut - are standard equipment on his second mission.
First, Discovery - scheduled to lift off in the wee hours Tuesday from Kennedy Space Center in Florida - is a $347 million servicing mission for the Hubble Space Telescope. The mission will be under scrutiny because of the risk the $4 billion telescope could be damaged as the astronauts attempt to upgrade its capabilities.
The mission certainly can't afford the glitch that struck a space shuttle Columbia flight in November. A jammed hatch prevented astronauts from taking two planned spacewalks. The walks are the mission's purpose this time.
Smith's role as a rookie spacewalker is critical as he attempts to maneuver delicate but bulky scientific equipment into the Hubble while wearing gloves he considers the equivalent of kitchen mitts.
But there's also the added anxiety for his friends and family, including parents Bob and Lillian Smith of Almaden Valley, who rejoice that their son can pursue his dreams but worry, nonetheless. And Steve Smith, who once again insists he has no reason to be nervous about his mission, does have concerns on the home front. Wife Peggy Brannigan will not attend the launch because of pregnancy complications; she's expecting their second child this spring.
Demanding period
'It is very stressful, but everybody's OK,' he said.
The demands on Smith are made manageable because of the unusual level of training he has received. He trained for his two six-hour walks for 20 months - twice as long as usual.
'It's such a complicated flight, NASA wanted people involved early,' Smith said. 'The difference between last flight and this flight is, I feel much less anxiety as far as being prepared. It's as if you'd been driving a car for 10 years rather than five.'
To prepare for his first extravehicular activity, or EVA to NASA types, on Day 4 of the mission, Smith logged nearly 150 hours of water training. He certainly should feel at home in the water; he was an All-America water polo player on two NCAA championship teams at Stanford University.
Air-bearing floor
He also spent time practicing on a precision air-bearing floor - NASA's equivalent of a humongous air-hockey table - with the two 800-pound telephone booth-sized boxes he will install in the Hubble.
On his first walk, Smith will remain attached to a robotic arm while crew mate Mark Lee floats on a tether, working on other tasks. The pair will replace 1970s technology with that of the 1990s, installing new optical equipment.
Part of the challenge for Smith: He will work with clearance space of an inch or two as he inserts the equipment, and he must follow Lee's oral instructions because he can't see around the box.
More tasks in store
On his second walk, on Day 6, Smith will do some floating as he helps Lee replace a mechanical tape recorder with a solid-state recorder, among other tasks. Another crew of two will conduct two spacewalks as well, on Days 5 and 7. Discovery has a seven-man crew.
On his first mission, Smith found viewing Earth from space a life-changing experience. Seeing the planet as 'an island in space' without borders, he said, has made him more tolerant and sensitive to the environment. This time, he's eager to experience space from outside the shuttle. He has heard from veterans that there can be the sensation of falling.
'When you're in your spacesuit, you are your own little spaceship out there,' he said.
After this, what's left: perhaps a stint on the space station and a few more flights?
'I would love to fly 10 times,' he said. 'But that's not fair to my friends and family. I have that strong a belief in its value.'
