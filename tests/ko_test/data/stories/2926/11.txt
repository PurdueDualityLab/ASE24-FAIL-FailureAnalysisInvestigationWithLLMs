Engineers satisfied with Hubble fix

SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) -- Just as NASA thought the Hubble Space Telescope renovation was finished early today, the instrument developed a worrisome glitch.
But engineers decided that a suspect part was healthy and that an unprecedented sixth spacewalk was not needed. The component is part of the telescope's steering system and a spare was available for a swap while the telescope is in the cargo bay of shuttle Discovery.
'We just completed a test on reaction wheel No. 2; it's good,' Mission Control told the astronauts after three hours of testing the suspect unit. The release of the spacecraft from the shuttle repair platform to free flight was scheduled for 1:41 a.m. tomorrow.
The replacement would have required another venture into the cargo bay by two spacewalkers. Instead, Mission Control gave the OK for the final step in the Hubble upgrade procedure, raising its orbit by about 10 miles.
Mission Control had decided an added day in orbit for the seven Discovery astronauts was out of the question. There is fuel for an extra two days that would be reserved for a shuttle emergency, such as bad landing weather.
The telescope is steered by four spinning wheels that, when brakes are applied selectively, transfer the momentum to move the 43-foot-high spacecraft. There is no rocket fuel on the Hubble.
Engineers at the Goddard Space Center in Maryland were putting the reaction wheels through their paces late yesterday when one of them gave trouble.
Another one of the reaction wheels was replaced earlier in this Hubble servicing mission. The telescope could operate with only three of the devices.
After several hours of testing, engineers said the suspect wheel was running normally. They recalled it had similar start-up problems three years ago when another crew of astronauts serviced the orbiting telescope.
When it is released back to free flight, the Hubble will operate with $ 347 million worth of new or upgraded parts and insulation patches to keep its extensive electronics comfortable.
