Just as NASA thought the Hubble Space Telescope renovation was finished early Tuesday, the instrument developed a worrisome ''glitch.'
But engineers decided a suspect part was healthy and that an unprecedented sixth spacewalk was not needed. The component is part of the telescope's steering system and a spare was available for a swap while the telescope is in the cargo bay of shuttle Discovery.
''We just completed a test on reaction wheel No. 2; it's good,'' Mission Control told the astronauts after three hours of testing the suspect unit. The release of the spacecraft from shuttle repair platform to free flight was scheduled for 1:41 a.m. EST (0641 GMT) Wednesday.
The replacement would have required another venture into the cargo bay by two spacewalkers. Instead, Mission Control gave the OK for the final step in the Hubble upgrade procedure, raising its orbit by about 10 miles (16 kilometers).
Mission Control had decided an added day in orbit for the seven Discovery astronauts was out of the question. There is fuel for an extra two days that would be reserved for a shuttle emergency, such as bad landing weather.
The telescope is steered by four spinning wheels that, when brakes are applied selectively, transfer the momentum to move the 43-foot-high (13-meter-high) spacecraft. There is no rocket fuel on the Hubble.
Engineers at the Goddard Space Center in Maryland were putting the reaction wheels through their paces late Monday when one of them gave trouble.
One of the reaction wheels was replaced earlier in this Hubble servicing mission, but it was not the one giving trouble. The telescope could operate with only three of the devices, but NASA is loath to launch spacecraft when a possible problem is known. Engineers worried it might fail altogether.
After several hours of testing, however, engineers said the suspect wheel was running normally. They recalled it had similar start-up problems three years ago when another crew of astronauts serviced the orbiting telescope.
Mark Lee and Steven Smith had just finished fixing Hubble's torn insulating cover when the problem surfaced. Mission Control had them go into the shuttle airlock, a compartment between the pressurized cabin and open space, and wait for a decision.
''We would prefer to do it today if it can be done,'' Hoffman told them, ''but we are not going to keep you hanging in the (airlock) all day.'' A few minutes later, Lee and Smith were told to stow away all gear in the cargo bay and end their spacewalk for the night.
They were in the cargo bay 5 hours, 17 minutes. Together with a second team of Gregory Harbaugh and Joe Tanner, the Discovery crew racked up a total of 33 hours, 11 minutes spacewalking time on the five excursions, not a record.
On Tuesday's spacewalk, Lee and Smith hung quiltlike patches over rips in the covers on three compartment doors in what was to have been the last act before sending the Hubble out for another three-year tour.
When it is released back to free flight, the Hubble will operate with dlrs 347 million worth of new or upgraded parts and insulation patches to keep its extensive electronics comfortable.
The fifth spacewalk was added after NASA officials saw the deterioration on the telescope's insulation, caused by the sun and constant changing from the extreme heat of daylight to the equally extreme cold of darkness.
Lee and Smith fastened six 9-inch-by-16-inch (23-cm-by-41-cm) patches with bits of foil, wire, clips, plastic twists and parachute cord procedures worked out on the ground in NASA's can-do tradition.
The entire procedure was carefully monitored in Mission Control by experts who sent Lee and Smith back at least once to one compartment to make sure the patch was not put on too tightly. The shuttle's video cameras were used to document the 2 1/2 hour task
The videos will be studied and more permanent fixes will be developed by the time a shuttle visits the Hubble again in late
999. A fourth servicing mission is planned for 2002.
