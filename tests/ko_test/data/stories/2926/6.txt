Shuttle astronauts finish Hubble cover up.

JOHNSON SPACE CENTRE, Texas, Feb 18 (Reuter) - Two spacewalking astronauts on Tuesday placed bandages on the Hubble's Space Telescope's damaged skin and waited while engineers checked a new glitch on the telescope.
Astronauts Mark Lee and Steve Smith tied down swathes of foil to cover up rips and cracks in the reflective blankets protecting some of the telescope's most critical components.
They also discovered the telescope was more weathered than first thought. They sent back television pictures showing long twists of peeled paint hanging from the handrails used by astronauts to climb across the telescope.
"It looks like about half of the paint is peeled up," Lee reported as he examined one handrail.
On earlier spacewalks, the astronauts had reported paint from the tarnished yellow handrails was rubbing off on their spacesuit gloves.
The astronauts spent about two hours applying strips of foil to two damaged equipment compartment doors and stretching wire across a third to hold down peeled insulation.
"We feel those are the three areas that are the most critical to go patch," Hubble manager Kenneth Ledbetter told a news conference.
The damage, thought to be caused by harsh ultraviolet radiation and corrosive atomic oxygen, was discovered during the first spacewalks of the shuttle's $350 million service call.
The silvery skin of Hubble was designed to keep the spacecraft cool through extreme swings in temperature.
Although there was no immediate concern, NASA officials said if the situation grew worse there was a danger the telescope's sensitive electronics, including it's science computer, could overheat.
As the spacewalk neared its end, the astronauts were asked to standby in case extra repair work was needed. Flight controllers at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Centre in Greenbelt, Maryland, detected a possible problem with one of the telescope's four reaction wheel assemblies, flywheel-like devices that manoeuvre the telescope.
"In the last half hour, Goddard has noticed a glitch," mission control's Marc Garneau told the crew. "We want to keep open the option of changing it out today."
The astronauts returned to the shuttle's airlock to recharge their spacesuits while they waited to hear if they needed to replace the device.
