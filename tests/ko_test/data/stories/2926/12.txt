NASA mulls record-breaking sixth spacewalk.

JOHNSON SPACE CENTRE, Texas, Feb 18 (Reuter) - Shuttle Discovery's astronauts on Tuesday patched up the Hubble Space Telescope's damaged skin, while ground controllers considered a record-breaking sixth spacewalk for a last-minute repair job.
Astronauts Mark Lee and Steve Smith had just completed repairs to the orbiting observatory's battered exterior, when telescope controllers reported a new problem.
Engineers at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Centre in Greenbelt, Maryland, discovered trouble with a flywheel device used to manuever the orbiting observatory.
"In the last half hour, Goddard has noticed a glitch," mission control's Marc Garneau informed the crew.
The spacewalkers were asked to standby in the shuttle's airlock in case they need to replace the unit at once, but mission control decided to wait the results of further tests.
The astronauts could make a spacewalk to install a spare flywheel late Tuesday, before the telescope is released back into orbit, officials said.
"We will ... maintain an option to do an EVA (spacewalk) plus deploy tomorrow, should that be necessary," spacecraft communicator Jeff Hoffman radioed the crew.
Earlier, Lee and Smith tied down swathes of foil to cover up rips and cracks in the reflective blankets protecting some of the telescope's most critical components.
They also discovered the telescope was more weathered than first thought. They sent back television views showing long twists of peeled paint hanging from the handrails used by astronauts to climb across the telescope.
"Its looks like about half of the paint is peeled up," Lee reported as he examined one handrail.
On earlier spacewalks, the astronauts had reported paint from the tarnished yellow handrails was rubbing off on their spacesuit gloves.
The astronauts spent about two hours applying strips of foil to two damaged compartments and stretching wire across a third to hold down peeled insulation.
"We feel those are the three areas that are the most critical to go patch," Hubble manager Kenneth Ledbetter told a news conference.
The damage, thought to be caused by harsh ultraviolet radiation and corrosive atomic oxygen, was discovered during the first spacewalks of the shuttle's $350 million service call.
The silvery skin of Hubble was designed to keep the spacecraft cool through extreme swings in temperature.
Although there was no immediate concern, NASA officials said if the situation grew worse there was a danger the telescope's sensitive electronics, including it's science computer, could overheat.
A fifth spacewalk was added to the mission to complete the repair work.
