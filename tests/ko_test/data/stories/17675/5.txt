A glitch-plagued and disputed Czech nuclear plant suffered its latest blow Friday as managers announced a new month-long closure, threatening to delay its commercial launch.
The Soviet-built Temelin plant, which has sparked fierce protests in neighbouring Austria, will close for 'at least a month' in June for repairs, said its director Frantisek Hezoucky.
The announcement appears certain to delay the scheduled operational launch of the plant, which Prague had hoped would start producing electricity commercially by June.
The Temelin plant began powering up last October, despite protests by both the Austrian government and environmental protestors who blockaded the border between the two countries.
But the single reactor at the plant, which is located some 60 kilometres (35 miles) from the Austrian border, has been repeatedly stopped due to technical faults, including a month-long shutdown in February.
In its latest glitch last Thursday, the reactor was powered down under emergency conditions after an oil leak, but was started again on Sunday.
A new series of tests have been scheduled for Sunday, plant spokesman Milan Nebesar said. Turbine vibrations and gas leaks are the main problems to be solved.
Hezoucky meanwhile told the Prague daily Pravo that that 44 strengthening rings which had been added to the reactor in February had ruptured, but said they were had been rendered superfluous by recent modifications.
The Czech government, which suffered a slump in economic growth in recent years, has pressing economic reasons for building the plant, which when fully online will provide some 20 percent of the Czech Republic's power needs.
But neighbouring Austria, which rejected nuclear energy in a 1978 referendum, has demanded safety guarantees for the plant
Vienna at one stage threatened to block Prague's EU membership negotiations over Temelin.
But it signed an accord last December agreeing to allow the plant to start up, but only after safety and environmental studies had been carried out. The accord specified that the plant could start producing electricity commercially, if all conditions were fulfilled.
Austrian Foreign Minister Benita Ferrero-Waldner expressed concern Thursday over the series of glitches in talks with Czech Foreign Minister Jan Kavan, but insisted Vienna will abide by the December agreement.
'Of course we are concerned that there are all these incidents,' Ferrero-Waldner told AFP.
But she said: 'If you have an agreement you have to stick to the agreement as long as the partner also maintains the right positions and commitments, and the Czechs are committed to that.'
Anti-nuclear protestors who staged border blockades last October, when Temelin first started powering up, have threatened to resume the blockades in recent days. Kavan said Thursday such action could threaten the December deal.
Construction of the Temelin plant began in the 1980s, but was only finished in the 1990s after extensive modifications and additions following the 1989 collapse of the Soviet bloc.
A second reactor at Temelin is due to begin the process of powering up in November this year, and experts say they have already successfully carried out tests on its air-tight seals.
