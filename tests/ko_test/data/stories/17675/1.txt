TEMELIN, Czech Republic, March 23 (AFP) - Managers of a disputed Czech nuclear plant powered it down urgently after an oil leak, the latest glitch to hit the Soviet-built reactor, a spokesman said Friday.
The Temelin plant, which has protests in neighbouring Austria, was reduced to four percent of its output Thursday evening after the leak, in which "several dozens litres" of oil escaped.
The plant, which was initially fired up last October, had been producing power at 40 percent of its capacity of 1,000 megawatts before the incident, and had been linked up to the national power grid.
The reactor at the Temelin plant, some 60 kilometres (35 miles) from the Austrian border, has been repeatedly stopped due to technical faults, including a month-long shutdown last month to modify equipment.
Construction of the Temelin plant began in the 1980s, but was only finished in the 1990s after extensive modifications and additions following the 1989 collapse of the Soviet bloc.
Austria at one stage threatened to block Prague's EU membership negotiations over the Temelin plant, but signed an accord last December agreeing to allow the plant to start up, but not before safety and environmental studies had been carried out.
The second reactor is due to begin the process of powering up in November this year, and experts have already successfully carried out tests on its air-tight seals, according to experts.
