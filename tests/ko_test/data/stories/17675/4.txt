TEMELIN, Czech Republic, March 28 (AFP) - Managers of a disputed Czech nuclear plant powered it down urgently again Wednesday following a new technical problem, a spokesman said.
The Soviet-built Temelin plant, which has sparked protests in neighbouring Austria, was reduced to 1.8 percent of its output capacity after vibrations developed in pipes in a secondary circuit, said spokesman Milan Nebesar.
Before the reduction the reactor, which has suffered repeated problems since being started up last October, had been powered up to 55 percent of its 1,000 Megawatt capacity, and had been plugged into the national grid.
The single functioning reactor at the Temelin plant, which is some 60 kilometres (35 miles) from the Austrian border, has been repeatedly stopped due to technical faults, including a month-long shutdown last month to modify equipment.
Last Thursday the reactor was powered down under emergency conditions after an oil leak, but was started again on Sunday.
Construction of the Temelin plant began in the 1980s, but was only finished in the 1990s after extensive modifications and additions following the 1989 collapse of the Soviet bloc.
Austria at one stage threatened to block Prague's EU membership negotiations over the Temelin plant.
However it signed an accord last December agreeing to allow the plant to start up, but only after safety and environmental studies had been carried out.
A second reactor at Temelin is due to begin the process of powering up in November this year, and experts have already successfully carried out tests on its air-tight seals, according to experts.
