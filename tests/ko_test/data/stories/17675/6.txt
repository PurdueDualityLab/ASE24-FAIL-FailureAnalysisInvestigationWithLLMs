PRAGUE, March 30 (AFP) - Managers of a disputed Czech nuclear plant announced Friday that its only running reactor will be closed down for at least a month in June after a series of technical problems.
The announcement appears certain to delay the scheduled operational launch of the Soviet-built Temelin plant, which Prague had hoped would start producing electricity commercially by June.
The single functioning reactor at the plant, which has sparked protests in neighbouring Austria, has been repeatedly stopped due to technical faults, including a month-long shutdown in February to modify equipment.
Austria at one stage threatened to block Prague's EU membership negotiations over Temelin, which is located some 60 kilometres (35 miles) from the Austrian border.
However it signed an accord last December agreeing to allow the plant to start up, but only after safety and environmental studies had been carried out. The accord specified that the plant could start producing electricity commercially, if all conditions were fulfilled.
Austrian Foreign Minister Benita Ferrero-Waldner expressed concern Thursday over the series of glitches in talks with Czech Foreign Minister Jan Kavan, but insisted Vienna will abide by the December agreement.
Anti-nuclear protestors who staged border blockades last October, when Temelin first started powering up, have threatened to resume the blockades in recent days. Kavan said Thursday such action could threaten the December deal.
Construction of the Temelin plant began in the 1980s, but was only finished in the 1990s after extensive modifications and additions following the 1989 collapse of the Soviet bloc.
In its latest glitch last Thursday, the reactor was powered down under emergency conditions after an oil leak, but was started again on Sunday.
A new series of tests have been scheduled for Sunday, plant spokesman Milan Nebesar said. Turbine vibrations and gas leaks are the main problems to be solved, according to the boss of the plant.
A second reactor at Temelin is due to begin the process of powering up in November this year, and experts say they have already successfully carried out tests on its air-tight seals.
