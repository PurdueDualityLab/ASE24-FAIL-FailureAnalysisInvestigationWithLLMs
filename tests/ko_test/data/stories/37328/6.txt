JD Power and all the Associates have revamped their IQS (Initial Quality Studies) for the first time since 1998. The IQS collects 60,000 surveys from new car and truck buyers after they've owned a new car or truck for 90 days, in order to track potential defects and glitches. The survey already asks some pretty intense stuff, but it's been beefed up a bit for the 2006 model year. How, you ask? Well...now there are five different paint finish imperfections to choose from: uneven, running, peeling and dirt or blemish. How's that different from last year? The only response last year was 'shitty.' Oh, and now there's an essay section.
