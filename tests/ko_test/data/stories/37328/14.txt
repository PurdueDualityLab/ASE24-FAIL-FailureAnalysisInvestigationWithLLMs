The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion - Xbox 360
HERE is a friendly warning - don't start this game unless you have ample free time to commit to it, like the upcoming long weekend.
Oblivion is the sequel to The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, named 2002 Role-Playing Game (RPG) and Game of the Year for both PC and Xbox.
With its free-reign game play an open-ended quest, Oblivion's depth as a role-playing game is staggering, leaving players with decision upon decision to make and hordes of creatures to kill.
Going back to the roots of classic RPGs, Oblivion is a single-player game where you pick your character traits, from warrior to wizard to thief, and work on levelling up your stats in armour, magic and weapons.
The objective? To save the world of course, but the good news is, the game lets you take your time to do it.
For one thing, the maps are massive, allowing you to roam the country, embarking on side quests and completing adventures unique to the guild you pick.
Otherwise, there's the ever-helpful quest diary that keeps track of any missions you might come across.
In case you get swamped with too much to do, you can always choose to return to the main storyline and soldier on.
With wide plains to traverse, alongside rich graphics and detailed charactering renderings, one might worry about the slow loading time between levels, but the Xbox 360 handles the task impressively.
The sound is equally impressive, with music, voices and each strike of the sword or hit of an arrow ringing uniquely throughout the game. The only drawback is the limitations of the game controller during battles.
With countless spells, potions and enchantments to cast during rough battles, the controller buttons allow you only eight hot keys to assign attributes to.
In the heat of fighting, it can get rather tedious switching between different icons and still focusing on the fight at hand.
Thankfully, with so much to manage, there is a very easy-to-use menu system guiding players, allowing effective management of all assets.
Oblivion's rich storyline, stellar graphics and open-ended game play more than make up for the few glitches in the game, making it one of the best RPGs to hit the market in recent memory.
