If you're having problems with Oblivion for the PC, you might want to check out the Beta Patch, which might fix the problem and might cause others. It's an exciting gamble. This does have one of my favorite patch notes ever: 'Fixed issue with disease resistences that made it impossible to contract vampirism under certain circumstances.' It's like an anti-vaccine.
