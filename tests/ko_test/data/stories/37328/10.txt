Let's face it: there's nothing more tedious than playing a game as intended. So in case you're still into Oblivion and want to know how to pull in the gratis Sacajaweas, here's a very simple to perform Oblivion unlimited money glitch. This is much simpler to perform than the last unlimited money glitch we posted. It also gives a pretty good look at the loveliness of the game, if you haven't seen it in action yet.
