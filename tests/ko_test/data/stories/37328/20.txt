Game Wire has sent along this press release from the president of the Interactive Entertainment Merchant's Association, thanking the ESRB for, well, for not taking even longer to figure out that there's more blood, gore, and secondary sexual characteristics than they thought in Oblivion. They also pat themselves on the back for blocking sales to youngsters immediately, a mere six weeks after the game was released.
The pace at which the IEMA retailers reacted to the change in the ESRB rating for The Elder Scrolls(R) IV: Oblivion(TM) today stands as testament to the effectiveness and commitment to the industry's self-regulatory efforts. As evidenced by the most recent FTC study, the nation's leading retailers now require identification for the purchase of Mature-rated games at approximately the same rate as the movie theatres do for R-rated film admission. When we were notified of the game's ratings change today, we alerted our member company representatives who communicated to their stores the change in the game's rating. The effective change in sales policy was immediate. In fact, several major retailers changed the cash register prompt tied to the bar code of the game (a technology which prompts cashiers to ask for ID). Of note in this matter is the speed at which retailers reacted and parents were empowered -- ultimately that is what makes any ratings system effective in the end.
Tasty, nutritious doublespeak.
