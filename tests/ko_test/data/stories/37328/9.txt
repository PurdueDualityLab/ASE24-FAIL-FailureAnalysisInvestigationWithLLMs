Blissfully oblivious

Clammy hands. A sickly green complexion. And a certain tightness in the hands.
Yes, I've definitely picked up something from my recent vacation.
One serious addiction.
No, I didn't take any time off work. And the only flight involved was the one from work, as I raced feverishly home each night to land on my couch.
But make no mistake, I've spent the past seven days living in oblivion.
Promising more than 200 hours of bleary-eyed, TV-twitching playtime, Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion may be the greatest time-waster ever.
As the first RPG title for the next-generation Xbox 360, it's a monumental leap in videogaming.
Oblivion was launched last month with a barrage of buzz, hype and game store countdowns - exactly what the 360 needed in its bid to gain a head start over not-yet-released next-generation consoles from Sony and Nintendo.
But it will set me back at least a month.
You see, the emperor has been assassinated. And if no heir is found, the gates of Oblivion - that's hell - will open, flooding darkness upon the land.
I'm not stressing it, though. Oblivion has a way of making you more than happy to roam the infinite countryside, getting to know characters, visiting caves and dungeons - while whacking the odd monster that gets in your way.
In case you're not familiar with this sort of thing, role-playing games focus on developing a character, often a burly warrior, crafty rogue or spell-weaving wizard.
In Oblivion, you choose from a massive variety of races and vocations, then set your creation loose on a vast mythical continent. As you gain experience, your character matures, getting better with a sword or a spell, or even fleeter of foot or nimbler of tongue.
Trouble is, Oblivion uses the 360's next-generation engine to paint a world of such unprecedented realism, it's all too easy to dally in the details - especially since there's no pressure to follow any single quest path.
Of course, you can't just go gallivanting anywhere you like. Bumble through the wrong door at the Arcane University and all of a sudden, fireballs are coming out of the woodwork.
'You're trespassing!' someone shrieks. Party's over.
If you had your own house - and a king's ransom - you could put your feet up and watch the world evolve around you.
I was scarcely in the door at the local pub in the quaint seaside town of Anvil, when a young man approached me. 'You wouldn't happen to be in the market for a home, would you?' he asked.
He was offering no mere house, but a manor. And it cost a paltry 5,000 gold pieces.
'No questions asked, please,' he added. 'Interested?'
So I dropped my nest egg.
The first night in my new abode was lovely, save for the small detail of being attacked by vengeful ghosts as soon as I fell asleep.
It seems the real estate agent neglected to mention the rotten corpse of an evil wizard buried in the basement.
It's enough to turn an honest man to a life of crime.
If you're a skilful sneak, you can pilfer a little gold or a soul gem from various houses. Naturally, I got greedy and cleaned out one of the innkeepers. As soon as I lumbered out the door, a town guard stopped me cold.
'Your thieving spree has come to an end,' he bellowed. The options? Pay a fine and surrender the stolen goods. Or spend a stint in the bastion.
Ever the cheapskate, I opted for hard time. What is time in Oblivion, anyway? It's real time that can be a problem.
After my first dip in Oblivion, I shambled off to work the next day, sleepless - and as green and mean as a goblin. Just let me get through this day, I vowed.
I tried to parcel my time a little more effectively. Maybe even shave and take a nice long bath. After all, it's not a race. But all those pretty vows were but straw to the fire in my blood. At lunch, I tried, in vain, to talk about it with friends. There's no 1-800 number for Oblivion junkies.
So this couch-craving soul slumped through the days and burned through the nights.
And for what?
Videogames are about as vacuous as waiting in a bank machine lineup. And, like lineups, we rue the days spent in their grasp.
But the lineup, at least, holds a hint of possibility. After all, you're standing on your own two feet, in a public place. There's even a chance of making a connection with another human.
Alone on the couch, letting muscles waste, bills pile up and friends drift away, there's no chance of anything. It is, in every sense of the word, oblivion.
There is, of course, one way to break the addiction. But it can very nearly break the man.
I was galloping along a lush stretch of countryside on a horse I had borrowed from some friar. Or was he a priest? In any case, he wasn't getting his horse back.
Somewhere along the Gold Coast, everything came to a sudden halt. The picture froze. Or was it my pupils? The console fan was still whirring loudly, the music was still playing, but the screen was completely frozen. Somewhere in the wee morning hours, Oblivion had usurped my reality. And reality crashed.
Trouble is, I had not saved the games in hours. I was never going back to Oblivion. Not after that unholy technical glitch. Free at last.
I shaved, called my mother and opened some mail that had arrived in the past week.
Of course, that was my only chance to run. At work, on the subway, all I could see was Oblivion. Stare at the sea for too long, and you will see waves crashing ashore in your sleep.
So, too, with the world of the Elder Scrolls.
The next day, all I could do was flick a switch on the Xbox 360.
And find my fix.
