Late last year, we posted a pretty crazy 5:30 speedrun of Super Mario Bros. We were wondering if anyone had managed to top that, so we did a search, and came up with this speed run of five minutes.
The craziest thing? The guy spends most of the time jumping Mario backwards. This must be some crazy speedrunning trick we know nothing about. He also manages to glitch his way through a few warp walls to shave off some time.
If you know a faster run, let us know about it!
