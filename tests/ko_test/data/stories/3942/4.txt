Swatting the millennium bug

You're a senior corporate executive. A potentially serious problem - one that could cost your company big money - is brought to your attention, What do you do? Simple. You eliminate the difficulty, or take measures to minimize the damage.
Seems like Management 101. Why, then, are so many Canadian managers unconcerned about what has come to be called the millennium bug? A recent Statistics Canada survey shows more than half the businesses questioned haven't done a thing to deal with this potentially disastrous computer glitch.
As The Financial Post's Jill Vardy has reported, the survey has so alarmed a federal task force established to analyse the problem that it has quickened the pace of its work. It will report to Ottawa three months earlier than originally expected - in February 1998, rather than May.
The bug, which could cause global chaos, has its roots in a 40-year-old programming feature. Most software uses two digits - not four - to represent the year. So when the year 2000 is reached, most computers will set the date at '00.' Computers could assume the date is Jan. 1, 1900, creating a mess of misery. Fixing the problem means re-writing millions of lines of computer code, likely at enormous cost. Statistics Canada said total domestic costs could be as high as $ 12 billion.
It is not as if executives don't see the problem. The survey shows 91% of respondents are aware technical difficulties could arise in 2000. But the will to take steps to address the issue is sadly lacking. Fifty-five per cent have done nothing.
BCE Inc. president and task force head Jean Monty suggests senior executives may assume information technology staff can deal with the issue. 'Wrong,' Monty says. 'This is a major project management issue.' Not only could business suffer, but directors and officers could be liable to shareholders and employees for losses they suffer as a result of not dealing with the bug. Managers have no excuse for inaction; if they do nothing, this bug will bite. And that could be very painful.
