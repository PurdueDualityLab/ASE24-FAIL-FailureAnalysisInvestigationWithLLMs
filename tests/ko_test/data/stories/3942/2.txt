Profits of doom In the year 2000, a computer bug threatens to disrupt banks, airlines, and even your microwave oven. But some entrepreneurs are already making millions from it.

You might say that Dominic K. Chan is a rich man today simply because, in the 1960s, a bunch of now-retired computer pro-grammers tried to save a few keystrokes. And even if that is a slight exaggeration, you won't get any argument from Chan about how he suddenly came into $42 million, give or take a few million.
Those first computer jocks, trying to condense software programs in the early days of the computer revolution, used a two-digit shorthand any time they had to enter a date: 1969 became 69, 1970 was 70, and so on. Even then, they knew there would be problems when the calendar turned to the year 2000. Hypothetically, the computer would think it had been reset to the year 1900 and either would begin producing multiple errors or would shut down.
But no one really believed that those rudimentary software programs would survive beyond a few years, let alone into the next century. "The programmers didn't have enough foresight or pride in themselves to think their programs would live this long," says a smiling Chan, who runs a small company called Peritus Software Services Inc., in Billerica.
Not only did the programs survive, they became the templates for the programs that succeeded them. These spawned even more programs and, eventually, became the standard for nearly all the programs used by computers today -- from the complex air-traffic-control and defense-related programs in huge government mainframes to the software in minicomputers and desktop networks that run the world's businesses.
Two years and a few weeks from now, when all those computers click to "00," the fallout from that oversight in the 1960s could well come back to haunt us. The doomsday scenarios have planes falling from the sky, bank accounts and medical records vanishing, commerce coming to a halt, security systems failing, the Internal Revenue Service and Social Security computers imploding, hundreds of companies collapsing, and our microwave ovens going on the fritz.
It's a serious thing all right, this glitch that goes by many names: the Millennium Bomb, the Year 2000 Problem, or, to use shorthand, the Y2K bug. But the whole thing would seem a lot more serious if Chan weren't so giddy, barely stifling a laugh when the subject comes up. If the crisis -- with the income potential it holds for Peritus Software Services -- fills the 48-year-old Chan with glee, he doesn't laugh at its potential impact. "What global warming is to environmentalists, year 2000 is to information service managers," he says.
Tucked away in an ugly box of a building in an industrial park, Peritus, until about a year ago, had just a handful of employees, several hundred thousand dollars in revenue, and peanuts for profits. It was one of those quiet little companies with odd names whose logos you see as you're driving on Route 128. If you take the time to find out what they do, the answer is invariably something like "outsourcing," "IT systems maintenance," "enterprisewide networking solutions," or some other tech buzz term. What does Chan's company do? He laughs again and says: "We find needles in haystacks." Simply put, Peritus is a debugger. Or was. When a bank, for example, merged with another bank and found the two computer systems were apparently incompatible, it called Peritus, whose engineers examined and tested all the lines of computer code to ferret out the problems.
Although it is a labor-intensive and not terribly sexy business, you can make a decent living doing it. Chan's customers paid his company almost $750,000 in 1992, its first year of operation. The next year, Peritus turned its first profit, a meager $188,000. By the end of 1995, the company was humming along, taking in $18 million in revenue, although its profits fell to $55,000, mostly because of increased expenses.
Then came an increasing awareness of the Year 2000 Problem. Turning its traditional debugging skills into tools that can find and correct a computer system's year 2000 glitch, Peritus will likely have profits this year that top $2 million. More than 75 percent of its anticipated $40 million in revenue will come from companies desperate to become "year 2000 compliant," which translates into "We've fixed our computers, and you haven't."
More significant, Peritus sold stock to the public for the first time this summer, and shares were snapped up at $16 each. It is now trading at around $18 (the stock fell from the low $30s in October when the company's net income exceeded the estimates of analysts who advised their clients to take some profits). Chan's personal stake in the company is worth close to $50 million. The company's market capitalization is near $200 million. In September, Peritus was named one of New England's "Fast 50" by the accounting firm Deloitte & Touche LLP, which ranked the fastest-growing privately held companies in the region from 1992 to 1996.
Call the Year 2000 Bug a crisis if you want, but it's a gold mine for Chan and dozens of other executives, consultants, lawyers, and engineers at Massachusetts companies who are gearing up to make fortunes in this new -- though transient -- field.
Those businesses were given a boost by a forecast issued two years ago by the Gartner Group. The Connecticut consulting company predicted that the world's corporations and governments will spend a total of more than $600 billion to fix the Y2K bug -- and that doesn't even take into account the aftermath of maintenance and litigation costs from related problems expected to arise after December 31, 1999. While the press, both technical and general, has focused on the scope of the problem and what could happen when the new century dawns, computer consultants and programmers have zeroed in on the dollar signs.
Gartner executives admit that their estimate is dated; it was made well before software tools to fix the problem, like Peritus's Automate 2000, were even on the market. No matter. Another Y2K consultant, Software Productivity Research, in Burlington, last month said the figure has ballooned, not declined. Capers Jones, Software Productivity's chairman, says the ultimate cost could exceed $3.6 trillion. "The Year 2000 Problem appears to constitute the most expensive single problem in human history," Jones warns on the company's World Wide Web site.
Even if the estimates are wildly inflated, companies are nevertheless going to spend millions just to find out if they have a "compliance" problem. Much of the spending will come gushing during the next two years, as awareness of the problem and the ensuing corporate panic spread. Executives like Dominic Chan will be there when the money starts pouring down. Analysts estimate that by the end of 1999, Peritus will have seen its earnings double every year since 1996, mostly due to year 2000-related sales. Not bad, considering that most people, according to recent polls, either haven't heard of the Year 2000 Problem or don't believe it even exists. The father of this year 2000 industry, and probably the first person to discover its path to riches and fame, is Peter de Jager, a 42-year-old Canadian management consultant who is most credited with creating awareness of the problem -- but also with inciting the hysteria. Although de Jager says he has been ringing the alarm for six years, it was his September 1993 article in Computerworld magazine, headlined "Doomsday," that got people's attention. Relatively restrained and dispassionate by today's standards, the article pointed out that a quirky computer problem could cause computer miscalculations. "Very real and very costly" was about as excited as de Jager became in explaining the problem. His main example: A computer had erroneously calculated his age in the year 2000. (The computer would subtract his birth year, 55, from 00, arriving at -55, instead of subtracting 1955 from 2000.)
De Jager estimated that Fortune 50 companies would have to spend between $50 million and $100 million to fix their systems, a figure that translated to about 35 to 40 cents per line of computer code in their systems. A big problem, for sure, but de Jager framed it as more of an annoyance than a disaster. By January of this year, he had changed his tune. The price for fixing the Millennium Bug had grown to more than $1 per line of code and would total $600 billion worldwide. An article he published that month, under the headline "You've Got to Be Kidding," began with this breathless, ellipsis-filled paragraph:
"Unless they are fixed . . . All computer programs . . . Everywhere in the world . . . Will go on strike on January 1st 2000 . . . Can you imagine . . . just for a moment . . . the chaos this would cause? There would be no air traffic, no traffic lights, no lights in your company, companies could not produce goods, no goods delivered to the stores, stores could not send you bills, you could not send bills to anyone else. Business would come to a halt."
That kind of prose catapulted de Jager out of the computer press and into headlines in the mainstream media, where top executives of the world's corporations started to pay attention. Suddenly, CEOs who couldn't find their way to the information services department in their own building became panic-stricken about the looming crisis. A Newsweek cover story last summer, dubbed "The Day the World Shuts Down," helped to fuel the flames. Computer experts and software engineers who tried to tell people that the Year 2000 Problem was big but manageable were ignored. Projects were delayed, new hiring was deferred, and corporate information-systems budgets exploded.
The media, for the most part, also found the story of computers in revolt irresistible. After all, it embodies both technology paranoia and millennium superstition -- the belief by some that a cataclysmic event will accompany our step into the 21st century. And unlike other computer viruses, the problem is easy to understand: After December 31, 1999, computers won't know what day it is, and they'll go nuts.
De Jager pounced on these sentiments and turned them into a home-grown industry. His Web site features a doomsday clock that updates companies on the latest happenings; he churns out magazine articles and has written a book on the topic; he makes frequent public appearances at seminars and workshops throughout the world. His "De Jager 2000 Index" of the stocks of 17 companies involved in solving the Y2K problem is up 60 percent in the last year, compared with 20 percent for the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
De Jager is unrelenting with his doomsday message. During a 50-minute address to computer executives in October, at the Sheraton Boston Hotel & Towers, he spent about half the time deriding the mainstream press for not paying enough attention to his warnings and said that the world's telephone system could stop working on January 1, 2000. We are now "in the black zone," he said, a scary place where it is already too late for businesses and governments to solve their millennium problem if they haven't already begun. "I'm beginning to lose faith in the whole process. We can train anyone we want. We have enough people, and we have the skill. What we don't have is the will."
Not coincidentally, de Jager maintains that the best method for fixing the problem is one espoused by the software company that sponsored his talk. But he angrily chided those who contend that he's in it for the money. "That's like if you go to your doctor, he says you have cancer, and you say, `You're just saying that because you get a lot of money from a cancer operation,' " de Jager said. "No, jerk, you have cancer." Responding to an e-mail inquiry about how much he is paid for each public appearance, de Jager wrote: "If you're interested in hiring me, I must tell you I'm booked beyond the year 2000." Economic growth fueled by the year 2000 crisis has spread to some unlikely places. In Bangalore, India, a huge warehouse has been set up for local software programmers to inspect computer code that the contractor receives from US companies. The US firms are looking to cut the cost of debugging computers by doing business in Asia.
Similar factories are popping up across the United States. Tucked away above an Ames Department Store in Rocky Hill, Connecticut, Keane Inc., a Charlestown-based software consultant, operates one of three Y2K code factories it opened this year. (The others are in Arizona and Nova Scotia.) "We run it just like an assembly-line plant," says Keith Davis, Keane's senior service delivery manager, as he looks out on the 200 or so young programmers seated elbow to elbow in a windowless oatmeal-colored room. "Our only product is corrected code."
Keane, one of the worldwide leaders in fixing year 2000 problems, is telling its corporate clients that they must have their solution in place by December 1998 if they hope to test it adequately before the big day. "You can expand the resources you have to deal with this problem," says Michael Murphy, the plant manager. "You can't expand the deadline."
In September, Keane announced that it would increase its staff by 45 percent and hire 4,000 employees by the end of the year, mostly to deal with year 2000 business. Just 1 percent of its $467 million in revenue last year was attributable to year 2000 work. This year, the bug will provide Keane with revenue of $125 million, or 20 percent of its expected $625 million in sales. Next year, the proportion will jump to more than 50 percent.
Keane stock, meanwhile, has increased from $14 a share in March to around $32 per share in recent weeks. And the future looks even brighter. "Systems are going to start to fail next year," Murphy says. "It will happen slowly and subtly for most people at first -- a bank account might not be credited properly or a credit card transaction will be rejected -- and then people will really start paying attention to it."
Nowhere is the panic to become year 2000 compliant more evident than in financial services companies, which depend more heavily on computers and accurate calculations than most businesses do. The BankBostons and Fidelity Investments of the world are spending millions, not just to clean their computer code but to ease customer fears that their investments will get lost in some computer crash.
The problem for most of the companies, though, is not how to fix the problem -- that is largely a simple computer programming task -- but where to find the people and the companies that can help them do it. "We have 60 million lines of code in almost 2,000 different applications," says Steven McManus, the spokesman for BankBoston Corp.'s Millennium Project. "We've determined that it will take 100 staff-years to fix it all. It's beyond being an in-house problem."
BankBoston is probably further along than most companies in addressing the Year 2000 Problem, and near McManus's office, a chart that tracks the company's progress indicates that it will just make the deadline. BankBoston has hired Keane and Data Dimensions Inc., a company based in Bellevue, Washington, that does nothing else but consult on year 2000 problems. Even the government agency believed to be most prepared apparently still has a long way to go. A report last month by the General Accounting Office said the Social Security Administration still has not assessed some of its critical computer systems.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, meanwhile, says it will pay $38 million over the next two years to consultants and computer companies to rid itself of the Millennium Bug. But that figure doesn't include estimates from some of the state's largest departments that are, at least by de Jager's standards, deep into the Black Zone and are only now assessing the extent of the problem.
As these billions of dollars flow from corporations and governments into the hands of consultants and programmers, a more subtle economic problem will surface, some experts say. Money being used to defuse the Millennium Bomb is money not spent on other things: hiring, plant expansion, new products.
At least one economist, Edward Yardeni, of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, is already predicting a mild recession in 2000 from the drag the bug will place on the economy. (Yardeni, however, also believes that "embedded systems" -- individual microprocessors in everything from elevators to cars to microwave ovens -- will go haywire in the next century, something even de Jager doesn't predict.)
But some of de Jager's disciples think the Y2K problem is manageable. "It's solvable, it's just huge," says Edward Caputo, the president of Command Systems Inc., a computer consulting company based in Farmington, Connecticut. "All the world's computer code doesn't have to be rewritten, but it does have to be looked at."
Caputo says he first encountered the Year 2000 Problem as a junior programmer for a big insurance company during the early 1970s. "The computer kept sending back errors, and I took the printout to a senior programmer who looked at it and said, `Here's the problem: You inputted four-digit dates,' " Caputo says. "After changing all the dates to two digits, the program ran. But I asked him, `What are we supposed to do in the next century?' He said, `Don't worry about it. We'll all have new systems by then.' "
Not quite. More than 50 percent of Command Systems's expected revenue next year will come from helping companies fix their year 2000 problems. To handle the new business, Caputo is shipping his customers' computer code to Bangalore, where it is "cleaned" and rewritten by people who toil six days a week at about half the price of domestic "code warriors." What becomes of this new billion-dollar industry once the next century begins? Not surprisingly, the consultants have an answer. Brian Keane, president of Keane Inc., says there will be plenty of business after January 1, 2000, to sustain the new field. "First, there will be testing and maintenance of the systems," Keane says. "But beyond that, I think we have created a new service industry with these factories for outsourcing."
At Peritus, Dominic Chan already has plans beyond 2000. He says the same skills and tools used in tackling the 2000 bug can be used to get computers to calculate Euro-dollar conversions and to accept new area codes and phone numbers as the telephone network expands.
Attorneys, meanwhile, are gearing up for liability lawsuits that are likely to be filed as computer and other systems begin to fail. Some analysts have estimated that the cost of litigating the year 2000 fallout could total $1 trillion. A Michigan produce store owner in September filed what is believed to be the first year 2000-related lawsuit. His cash registers froze when customers used credit cards with year 2000 expiration dates, and the grocer claims that the manufacturer knew the problem existed, or should have, when it sold him the machines.
"It's a much larger problem than a computer problem," says Steven Goldberg, a partner at the Boston law firm of Cosgrove Eisenberg and Kiley, and one of the few attorneys now specializing in the field. "We're more interested in prevention at the moment, because we have a window of opportunity to identify the problems and anticipate them. {But} the litigation is going to happen, and there will be a lot of it. Most executives don't realize it's not limited to a technical problem," he says.
Even those who see the Millennium Bug as a problem best left to consultants and programmers can't resist the temptation to ring the apocalypse bell. With his company's financial future rosy and new business exploding at a record pace, Keane Inc.'s Keith Davis seems carefree. But shortly after dismissing most of the millennium hysteria and insisting that there will be no great disaster at the stroke of midnight on January 1, 2000, Davis is asked where he plans to be that New Year's Eve. His reply: "I won't be on a plane, that's for sure."
