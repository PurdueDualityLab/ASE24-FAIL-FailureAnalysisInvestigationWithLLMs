VLADIVOSTOK. July 5 (Interfax) - The Vostok-2010 exercise confirms Russia's readiness to guarantee its security in the Asia-Pacific region, President Dmitry Medvedev has said on Sunday.
"Asia-Pacific is a rapidly growing and developing part of the world. If we are working here, developing our economy here, advancing our Far East so naturally we should be ready to guarantee the security of this country in Asia-Pacific given the problems that exist here," Medvedev said at a conference reviewing the preliminary results of the exercise with the top command of the army and navy aboard of the heavy nuclear-powered cruiser Pyotr Veliky.
Even though there are not so many problems in this region as in other places, "they still exist," he said.
"Such an exercise should demonstrate our capability of handling such tasks in this region," he stressed.
VLADIVOSTOK, Russia. July 5 (Interfax) - Russia will continue to fight sea piracy because it "was, is and must be a great sea power," President Medvedev said on Sunday.
"It would be unseemly on our part to cop out when such difficult tasks are being handled or to suggest that other countries should do this while we keep low profile and save money," Medvedev said at a ceremony in which he conferred state honors on Pacific Fleet sailors who had taken part in rescuing hijacked tanker Moskovsky Universitet (Moscow University) it the Gulf of Aden in May
"That is not an option for us. We will definitely take up those tasks. We will help both our own merchant ships and foreign participants in merchant sea navigation so that they are able to move through the ocean peacefully," he said.
The Moscow University rescue operation was "quick and successful," Medvedev said. "It was done efficiently, competently, intelligently, without any serious problems. Thereby you have made it evident that our navy is capable of not only carrying out global tasks of maintaining peace but also carrying out local tasks, such as combating piracy."
Piracy had been a very serious threat in recent years, the president said.
"This work will continue despite the fact that it needs concentrated efforts and, it must be admitted, quite serious financial inputs. Nevertheless, I believe it means obviously benefit, both for our country and for foreign vessels," he said.
The pirates who raided the Moscow University on May 5 took 23 Russian sailors hostage.
The crew were able to issue an emergency signal, cut off power and barricaded themselves in one of the compartments. They were released by marines who had arrived aboard the anti-submarine destroyer Marshal Shaposhnikov.
MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax) - President Dmitry Medvedev has greeted U.S. President Barack Obama on the U.S. national holiday - Independence Day, the Kremlin press service reported on Sunday.
"Russian-American ties are now developing steadily and dynamically," the message says.
Medvedev notes that through joint efforts the sides achieved serious progress in strengthening strategic stability and nuclear nonproliferation. "We are effectively interacting in tackling pressing international political, financial and economic issues," the message says.
"The progress achieved became possible thanks to both sides being set on a frank and equal dialogue, their readiness to take each others' interests into account," it says.
In Medvedev's opinion, today it is essential to expand the bilateral agenda, to enrich it with new promising directions of cooperation. "It was in this constructive vein that my visit to the United States took place," Medvedev said.
"My visit to San Francisco and the Silicon Valley was quite enlightening, extremely useful in the contest to the current modernization of the economy in Russia. I recall our friendly contacts in Washington with warmth," the message says.
According to the president, the talks were extensive as usual and "the understandings reached are meant to add the necessary dynamics to the efforts to advance mutually-beneficial and pragmatic Russian-U.S. partnership."
"I am sure that the constructive, neighborly relations of Russia and the United States meet the true interests of the peoples of our countries, the interests of security and stability in the whole world. This in itself makes hopeless and groundless the attempts to downplay the importance of our achievements and to hinder our consistent work in the spirit of partnership," the message says.
Medvedev wished Obama and his family good health and wellbeing "and success and prosperity to all U.S. citizens."
BLAGOVESHCHENSK. July 5 (Interfax) - Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has ordered to quickly improve the national border infrastructure in the Far East similarly to how the same was done in the Caucasus.
"Our business ties with neighbors are actively growing, and the success of this task will depend on resolution of the border and customs issues," the president said at a meeting that focused on the customs and migration problems in the border regions.
Another task is to protect the natural and biological resources in the Far East, the president said. "This has to be sorted out. This is a very difficult topic, and no result has been achieved throughout all the years it was being dealt with," the president said. "This requires better legislation and better control," the Russian president said.
MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax) - The six nations (the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, China, Russia and France), mediating Iran's nuclear problem have expressed their preparedness for a dialog with Tehran.
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov attended a meeting of the six nations' Political Directors a day earlier, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Saturday.
"The parties exchanged their views on the status of affairs in this area in light of the new sanctions resolution N1929 made by the United Nations Security Council with respect to Iran on June 9, 2010. All parties involved in this format reaffirmed their commitment to the swift political and diplomatic settlement of the situation around the Iranian nuclear problem and their preparedness for a dialog with Tehran for these purposes, including the implementation of the fuel swap scheme for Tehran's research reactor," the ministry said in a statement.
Ryabkov and U.S. Under Secretary of State William Burns also met on the sidelines of this event in their capacity of the co-chairmen of the working group for political coordination of the U.S.-Russian Bilateral Presidential Commission. "They discussed the pressing bilateral and international issues and the timetable for relevant contacts at various levels for the forthcoming period," the Russian Foreign Ministry said.
BLAGOVESHCHENSK. July 5 (Interfax) - The Customs Union is an absolute priority for Russia, said Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on Saturday.
The government should pay paramount attention towards the work of the Customs Union, the president said at a meeting on the customs and migration problems in the border regions.
He said that after his trip to the Far East he will be heading to Astana to attend events that will focus, among others, on customs problems.
"I would like to note to the government that we need to pay particular attention to the work of the Customs Union," the president said.
The Customs Union "is a new structure, which is why we need to make sure that our business works in proper conditions," he said. "Many of them [entrepreneurs] are saying that they are not clear how everything will work. Many fear that business will be paralyzed for a while and it will impossible to supply goods," Medvedev said.
"The Customs Union is an absolute priority that requires your particular attention. We should not create additional procedures that would make it more difficult for people to enter and goods and money to be brought to our country," the president said. "The relevant restrictions must result from law and be reasonable and sufficient," he said.
ASTANA. July 5 (Interfax) - President Dmitry Medvedev has announced that a declaration on the enforcement of the Customs Code of the Customs Union of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan was signed at the summit of the Eurasian Economic Community (EurAsEC).
"A statement was signed on the enforcement of the Customs Code. In relations between the three countries it will be applied as of July 6 this year. In relations between the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan as of July 1, 2010," he said at a briefing in Astana after the summit.
ASTANA. July 5 (Interfax) - Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are considering the possibilities of joining the Customs Union.
"Kyrgyzstan being a WTO member has set up a working group and is studying the possibility of joining the Customs Union. We are determined to join the Customs Union," Kyrgyz President Roza Otunbayeva said at a briefing in Astana.
In turn Tajik President Emomali Rahmon said: "As for Tajikistan's accession to the Customs Union, we are very seriously dealing with the issue."
ASTANA. July 5 (Interfax) - The single economic space should start working on January 1, 2012, Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov said.
"The full single economic space package should start working no later than January 1, 2012," Shuvalov told a briefing after the EurAsEC summit.
On Monday, the presidents decided that "the governments of the three countries need to take all measures and work very actively to ensure that all agreements forming the single economic space are ready by January 1, 2011," Shuvalov said.
Shuvalov recalled that it was initially agreed to prepare only the first of the 14 agreements by this date.
"However, it has been decided to speed up work and we need to do everything to develop and adopt the entire package by January 1, 2011," Shuvalov said.
MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax) - The first parliamentary hearing on the ratification of the new Russian-U.S. Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), which was signed on April 8, will be held in the Russian State Duma on Tuesday, July 6.
"Among the people taking part in the hearing will be Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov and a group of heads of the Defense Ministry structural divisions," Konstantin Kosachyov, the head of the international affairs committee of the State Duma, told reporters on Monday.
Kosachyov confirmed the earlier reports stating that closed consultations will be held on Monday with the so-called Wise Men group comprising former Soviet and Russian ambassadors to leading Western countries.
The hearing will begin in Hall 830 of the new State Duma building at 11:00 a.m.
ASTANA. July 5 (Interfax) - Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said he is hoping the work of the customs union will lead to the creation of a common market and a single currency market.
"We have now reached a very high level of integration. There is a Customs Union and it has started working. I believe the single economic space will lead to the creation of a common market, which will eventually lead to the creation of a joint currency space, which you have called for more than once and which the Russia Federation has always supported," Medvedev said during a meeting with his Kazakh counterpart Nursultan Nazarbayev in Astana on Monday.
ASTANA. July 5 (Interfax) - Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has assured his Kyrgyz counterpart Roza Otunbayeva that Russia will always support Kyrgyzstan.
"I am hoping that Kyrgyzstan can achieve success and overcome its difficulties under your guidance, which will help unite the nation and avoid various problems," Medvedev said while meeting with Otunbayeva in Astana.
"In this respect, you can always have the support of the Russian people and the Russian state," Medvedev said.
Medvedev said the situation in Kyrgyzstan is reflecting on the general situation in Central Asia. "We in Russia are an integral part of this region. For this reason, we are hoping we can work out the right reference points for the development of Russian-Kyrgyz relations in the nearest future and the long-term perspective," Medvedev said.
Medvedev said people will remember the tragic events of the recent riots in Kyrgyzstan for decades.
"The main thing now is to give the right impetus to all Kyrgyz citizens regardless of their ethnic origin or religious affiliation that all citizens are equally respected and protected by law. If you can solve this problem, I am confident the development on other tracks will go better and faster," Medvedev said, reiterating that Russia will support Kyrgyzstan in that.
"Russia cares for the fate of the Kyrgyz state and the people of Kyrgyzstan. A lot depends on how the referendum results will be implemented in everyday life and how the political system will develop," Medvedev said.
Kyrgyzstan switched from presidential to a parliamentary form of governance after the June 27 referendum.
Otunbayeva, in turn, said the Kyrgyz authorities are ready for new riots.
"The situation has somewhat calmed down, but we are ready for more outbreaks. I can't say that everything is over and we can start rebuilding," Otunbayeva told Medvedev.
Otunbayeva said the main task of the Kyrgyz administration now is to provide shelter to 110,000 refugees. "An estimated 110,000 refugees crossed the border and came back within ten days. We are thankful to the Uzbek government for their balanced position. They made a brave step," Otunbayeva said.
Otunbayeva said these people now have to be provided with housing. "The situation is difficult and tense," she said.
Otunbayeva thanked Medvedev for Russia's support she has constantly felt.
MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax) - The victory of Bronislaw Komorowski in the Polish presidential election provides a chance for improving Moscow-Warsaw relations, Russian political experts said.
"Poland is tired of the unpromising confrontation with Russia, and both Polish presidential candidates know that. It would have been difficult to make any forecasts if Jaroslaw Kaczynski had won the election. He is less predictable than Komorowski, and he could simply make use of the Poles' bigger sympathy for Russia," First Vice-President of the Political Technologies Center Alexei Makarkin told Interfax on Monday.
Meanwhile, the victory of Komorowski gives a real chance for improving bilateral relations, he said.
"Certainly, Komorowski is not pro-Russian, but he is a realist. Relations with Russia are an important strategic factor for Komorowski, the same as for Prime Minister Donald Tusk. In this context, the victory of Komorowski is more beneficial for Russia," Makarkin said.
The presidency of Komorowski will give more grounds to expect "considerable minimization of the irritants that existed in the history of Russia-Poland relations," the expert said.
"Komorowski is a pragmatic politician, who wishes a real and all-inclusive integration of Poland into the European Union so that Poland does not look exotic there," he said.
VLADIVOSTOK. July 5 (Interfax) - The ability of fighters to make nonstop flights from the European part of Russia to the Far Eastern military district were checked for the first time during the Vostok-2010 exercise, chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Gen. Nikolai Makarov has reported to President Dmitry Medvedev.
The president asked how many times the fighters were refueled in the air. Makarov said that Sukhoi Su-24M aircraft were refueled three times and Su-34 aircraft two times.
At a conference reviewing the preliminary results of the exercise aboard the heavy nuclear-powered cruiser Pyotr Veliky Makarov said that strikes at orders received during the flight were drilled.
What makes the current exercise special is that it is conducted very dynamically at 18 testing ranges of two military districts and the Pacific Fleet, he added.
"The Vostok-2010 exercise is the biggest event in the training of troops this year," Makarov said.
He said that in the framework of the exercise three special drills were conducted in routing militant groups at three firing ranges. He also said there was a drill in repelling massive rocket and air strikes with range practice of three air defense brigades in Chita region.
The troops and forces of the Pacific Fleet also conducted an exercise in the Sea of Japan that for the first time in the Far East involved striking critical targets in Primorye, Makarov said.
MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax) - The first stage of the Vostok-2010 exercise, which ended on Saturday, was highly rated by the exercise command, the Russian Defense Ministry said.
"According to the assessment by the exercise command, the forces of various levels have successfully accomplished their tasks of working out and making the decisions involving the use of troops (forces) and practicing interoperability with other security structures," the Defense Ministry said in a press statement obtained by Interfax on Saturday.
At the first stage, a number of formations from the Far Eastern and Siberian military districts and the Pacific Ocean Fleet were put on alert and sent to the rehearsal areas.
Motor rifle formations conducted a number of special operations in cooperation with the Interior Ministry's Internal Troops and Army Aviation in the Kemerovo and Amur regions and the Republic of Buryatia. "At the live firing rehearsal stages, forces practiced blocking areas occupied by illegal armed groups. The personnel acted confidently and earned a high appraise from the command," the statement said.
More than 10,000 servicemen and some 1,000 pieces of arms and military hardware were involved in the rehearsals.
"At the second stage, the intensity and complexity of the tasks will increase several times. More than 15 rehearsals will be held at various sites in the Siberian and Far Eastern regions," the Defense Ministry said in the statement.
VLADIVOSTOK. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - The final stage of the large-scale military maneuvers, which include the Vostok-2010 strategic exercise, will be held in 2011, Russian Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov told journalists on Saturday.
"These are very large, massive exercises. There have never been such exercises throughout the history of modern Russia. They are the second stage of the [Autumn] exercise held in North Caucasus, Russia's northwestern part and in Belarus in 2009," said Serdyukov, who has arrived to the Far East to watch the Vostok-2010 maneuvers.
"Next year will see the final stage of these large-scale exercises that will ultimately involve all types of the Armed Forces and branches of troops," he said.
In all, the Vostok-2010 "will involve about 20,000 servicemen, just over 5,000 weapons and pieces of military equipment, over 40 ships and about 75 airplanes and helicopters," Serdyukov said.
"During the exercises, our troops do not operate against a specific enemy but practice counter-terrorist operations," the defense minister said.
VLADIVOSTOK. July 5 (Interfax) - President Dmitry Medvedev has said that the tasks given to participants in the naval stage of the Vostok-2010 exercise were carried out professionally.
"The tasks put forward were carried out professionally and effectively. Knowledge of the equipment and skills to tackle tactical and strategic tasks were demonstrated. I hope that we will continue conducting corresponding stages of operational-tactical exercises such as Vostok-2010 in the same way," Medvedev said on Sunday at a conference reviewing the preliminary results of the exercise with the top command of the army and navy aboard of the heavy nuclear-powered cruiser Pyotr Veliky.
CHITA. July 5 (Interfax) - World's largest military training ground at Telemba in Russia's Siberian military district will soon be expanded to enable tests of the newest S-400 surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems, head of the training ground Col. Sergei Kuryshkin said on Saturday.
"Currently, we are considering using the training ground for S-400 SAMs and other advanced systems," he said.
This will require a significant extension of the training ground's area, Kuryshkin said.
"Currently, we are in talks with the administration of the Republic of Buryatia over the handover of an additional 160 kilometer long, 70 kilometer wide land plot to the training ground," said the head of the training ground.
The land plot in question will not be attached permanently, but only for the duration of a firing period, following which it will be returned to the regional authorities, he said.
MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - Pantsir-S close-range anti-aircraft gun and missile system is being supplied to Russia's air defense units, Air Force Anti-Aircraft Missile Force Commander Maj. Gen. Sergei Popov said.
"The system took part in the VE-Day parade in Moscow on May 9, 2010. The system has proven its worth, and we are using it in all exercises," he said in a live program of the Ekho Moskvy radio on Saturday.
"In my opinion, the Pantsir-S is a rather good system which is bound to replace the old S-125. The Pantsir-S carries twelve rockets and 14,000 projectiles and three target tracing channels and can fire while in motion," Popov said.
Air defense units are armed with S-300 of various modifications, S-400 'Triumf' and a small number of Buk-M1.
The close-range Pantsir-S is a product of the Tula Instrument Design Bureau. It is a unique system capable of destroying all types of modern and prospective aerial targets, primarily high precision armaments at a range of up to 20 kilometers and an altitude of up to 15 kilometers. The missile speed is 1,300 meters per second.
The system can be used against land- and sea-based lightly-armored targets and personnel. It is capable of firing from stationary positions and in motion, as well as during brief stops.
NAZRAN. July 5 (Interfax) - Two servicemen were killed and four were wounded in a recent attack against a military motorcade in the Nazran region of Ingushetia.
The attack took place on the Kavkaz federal road near the village of Yandare in the Nazran region of the republic, in the early hours of Monday, an official with the Investigations Committee of the Russian Prosecutor's office told Interfax.
In Dagestan, an OMON special police motorcade and the house of the head of the district interior affairs department for the Khasavyurt district of Dagestan were shot at, the Dagestani Interior Ministry told Interfax.
"Unknown individuals attacked a motorcade carrying Volgograd OMON special task police near the village of Gubden, Karabudakhen district, around 6:00 p.m. wounding one policeman," the source said.
"Unknown individuals opened fire on the house of the head of the district police, wounding one policeman," the source said.
The Interior Ministry of Dagestan reports that two people were wounded in a Sunday explosion in Makhachkala.
"The blast occurred at approximately 12:45 p.m. Early reports indicate that two people were hospitalized with wounds. They are being identified," a ministry spokesman said.
He said the bomb went off in a road leading to a base of the OMON special police. The bomb was planted in a garbage can on the sidewalk.
A criminal case has been opened in relation to an explosion in a prayer house for all religions belonging to a community of Seventh Day Adventists in Kaspiisk, Dagestan, Interfax was told at the Dagestani Interior Ministry on Saturday.
"A case of gross misconduct has been opened. All the necessary investigative measures are being taken," a ministry spokesman said.
Earlier reports said that two bombs went off in the prayer house.
"According to our information, unidentified explosive devices went off at 00:55 a.m. and 01:30 a.m. in the grounds of the prayer house. Nobody was killed or hurt," a spokesman for the Dagestani division of the Investigative Committee with the Prosecutors' Office told Interfax on Saturday.
A senior member of the community of Seventh Day Adventists in Dagestan Igor Zaluzhny said that there were ten people in the building at the time of the explosions but nobody was hurt.
"At 0:55 a.m. unidentified attackers threw a grenade into the window in the second floor of the building. There were ten people inside - our preacher with is wife who live there and eight guests from Ukraine. Fortunately, nobody was hurt," Zaluzhny said.
He said the second bomb went off in the court yard at about 1:30 a.m.
"By a happy coincidence nobody was hurt in the second blast either," he said.
The blasts broke the windows in the building and partly destroyed one wall.
A police officer has been killed in the capital of Kabardino-Balkaria, a source in the law enforcement agencies told Interfax.
"Unidentified gunmen mortally wounded a police officer in a street crossing in Nalchik," the source said.
A search for the servicemen's attackers has now begun in the above-mentioned republics. Investigations are under way.
ALICANTE, Spain. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - The Russian Emergency Situations Ministry will soon buy an additional batch of Kamov Ka-32 helicopters.
"The Emergency Situations Ministry has a number of Ka-32 helicopters, which are being used actively and modernized. Additional purchases are planned. A contract on the delivery of five Ka-32 helicopters is being prepared for signing," First Deputy Managing Director of the Kumertau Aviation Plant Vyacheslav Kovalyov said.
The delivery is due this or next year. "The Emergency Situations Ministry will keep buying the helicopters but Ka-32 exports are even more intensive," he said.
The Emergency Situations Ministry used the Ka-32 horizontal fire fighting system for the first time on June 30, 2010, for putting out a blaze at the Moscow Radio Instrument Research institute. "The Ka-32 put out the fire with the help of the horizontal water gun," Kovalyov said.
DUSHANBE. July 2 (Interfax) - The drug mafia had a hand in the June riots in southern Kyrgyzstan, Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) Secretary General Nikolai Bordyuzha said on Friday.
"It is safe to say today that southern Kyrgyzstan is turning into one of the leading routes for trafficking Afghan drugs further to Kazakhstan, Russia, and Europe," Bordyuzha said at a CSTO conference dealing with measures against illegal drug trafficking in Dushanbe on Friday.
Despite the difficult situation in Kyrgyzstan, which Bordyuzha described as "a fragile peace," he said the decision not to send CSTO forces to that country was right.
"The decision not to send military forces there was absolutely reasonable and warranted, and the heads of state made it after comprehensively analyzing information on the situation in the Kyrgyz republic," he said.
The Kyrgyz authorities should start restoring confidence between the two largest ethnic communities in southern Kyrgyzstan, i.e. ethnic Kyrgyzes and Uzbeks, he said.
"I have seen myself that the situation in southern Kyrgyzstan is quite stable now. Refugees have come back, and stores, markets, and enterprises have begun working, although there is a potential chance that the situation could worsen," he said.
The CSTO is comprised of Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.
ST. PETERSBURG. July 2 (Interfax) - Two Russian sailors taken hostage by pirates who hijacked Greek freighter North Spirit off Cameroon in mid-May have contacted the company owning the vessel, Balthellas Chartering S.A., and told it they are well, the Russian trade union of sailors said on Friday.
Captain Boris Tersintsev and chief mechanic Igor Shumik are part of the North Spirit's 16-member Russian-Ukrainian crew.
The day the Greek vessel was hijacked, May 16, pirates also raided nearby Lithuanian ship Argo and abducted its captain, Dmitry Bashkirov.
The three captives are awaiting the outcome of current talks, the Russian sailors union said in a report posted on its website. "The exact whereabouts of the sailors held captive are unclear," it said.
On May 16, an armed group attacked the North Spirit as it was anchored off Cameroon. The pirates plundered the crew's cabin and took the captain and chief mechanic hostage. The same evening pirates attacked Lithuanian ship Argo nearby and, threatening weapons, forced him to go over into their bat and took him away in an unknown direction.
There was no news of the three sailors until May 20, when the pirates allowed the Russian captain to phone Barthellas Chartering. Tersintsev told the company he and the other two captives were in Nigeria currently.
After that, the Russian sailors union contacted the Russian Foreign Ministry and Russian Embassy in Cameroon. Russia's top criminal investigation body took up the North Spirit hijacking case.
NEW DELHI. July 5 (Interfax) - A lawyer to a Russian woman detained in India on suspicion of spying is drawing up a counterclaim against what he sees as illegitimate actions by law enforcement agencies involving psychological pressure on her, the Russian Embassy to India told Interfax on Saturday.
Olga Timoshik, 31, a resident of Krasnoyarsk, was arrested in Jaipur on June 23 with an overstayed visa and an expired passport. Since then, she has been held in a cell at a police station in the town of Rupnagar (Ropar), the state of Punjab.
Punjab law enforcement agencies claimed that the Russian woman could be involved in suspicious activities, including spying.
The Russian Embassy said in a statement that no particular charges had been brought against Timoshik at court hearings, which started on Thursday. The prosecution only doubted authenticity of a document, which Timoshik said she had received in Bangalore and produced as one proving that she had applied for extending her visa. These doubts, however, had not been supported by any documents, the embassy said.
A Rupnagar court held another hearing on Timoshik's case on Saturday. "Despite the fact that the prosecution again could not provide any evidence of the Russian citizen's guilt, the judge ruled to extend her custody term until 3:00 p.m. Sunday, July 4," the embassy said.
The judge extended Timoshik's custody term when heard that a laptop seized from her was still being examined in a special lab to make a conclusion about its contents, the embassy said.
"According to statements by our arrested compatriot and her lawyer, police are applying strong psychological pressure on her, demanding that she admit her guilt but not saying what exactly the Russian citizen should confess to," said Vasily Pronin, the head of the embassy's consulate department.
"The embassy is closely following the development of the situation in the Russian woman's case, and its representatives attend all court hearings," Pronin said. Moreover, the embassy "intends to use official channels to draw the Indian government bodies' attention to this gross violation of the Russian citizen's legitimate rights," he said.
TAMBOV. July 5 (Interfax) - The law on countering corporate raids in Russia will be expanded by an adequate law-enforcement practice, said Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Corporate raiding is a "woe for the [Russian] economy," Putin said at a session of the presidium of the Council on national projects in Tambov.
"This is a woe for the entire economy and even for our defense industry," the prime minister said.
"Together with the judicial system, we will try to work out an adequate law-enforcement practice to fight corporate raiding," he said.
A day earlier Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said that he signed into law the changes to the Penal and Criminal Procedural Code, regarding corporate raids.
"Corporate raiding is a complicated and very dangerous crime, which effectively strangles the economy. Moreover, the number of such crimes has recently increased," Medvedev said at a meeting with Interior Minister Rashid Nurgaliyev at Vnukovo Airport before flying out to the Far East.
The federal law imposes criminal liability for actions relating to corporate raiding, such as seizure of corporate property, property and non-property rights and funds.
In particular, it is a crime to enter false information into the register of shareholders, intentionally destroy or forge documents.
Knowingly submitting forged documents with the executive authorities will also entail criminal prosecution.
The law also criminalizes actions such as intentional misrepresentation of the results of shareholders' voting at a general meeting.
The legal changes will enable to prosecute corporate raiders already at an early stage of corporate raiding before the reclaiming of seized property may be hindered by the institute of protection of a bona fide purchaser.
DUSHANBE. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - The total area under opium poppy in Afghanistan will not reduce this year, but even if it did, the amount of opium stockpiled in this country will be enough for many years ahead, Director of Russia's Federal Drug Control Service (FSKN) Viktor Ivanov told journalists on Friday.
"Basically, there has been no reduction in plantation area. Moreover, according to the United Nations, crop areas will not reduce," said Ivanov, who is attending the eighth session of the Coordination Council of chief anti-drug officers from the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) member states in Tajikistan.
"Afghanistan has stockpiled huge amounts of opium. To date, over 13,000 tonnes of opium have been stockpiled, according to our data that coincide with those of our U.S. colleagues and the UN," the FSKN chief said.
"This is mafia's stabilization fund which enables their continuous operation, regardless of poor seasonal conditions and other cataclysms," Ivanov said.
Afghanistan is the world's leading producer of opiates (opium and heroin), he said. Recently it has replaced Morocco as the leader in production of hashish, a type of resin made from cannabis.
Each kilogram of opium can yield 100 grams of heroin. Afghan drugs are infiltrating Russia through the Central Asian countries and recently through Iran and the Caucasus countries as well.
"The problem relating to drugs and transnational drug trafficking has essentially took the baton from counterterrorism, having become a top issue on today's list of the challenges facing humankind," the FSKN chief said.
"We are getting increasingly convinced that it is precisely transnational drug trafficking that causes extremism, terrorism and epicenters of instability," Ivanov said.
ST. PETERSBURG. July 5 (Interfax) - The captain of the North Spirit ship, Boris Tersintsev, and its senior mechanic, Igor Shumik, captured by Nigerian pirates in Cameroun have been released, Interfax was told at the Seafarers Union of Russia on Sunday.
They were released for ransom; however, the sum was not disclosed.
"By now the sailors have been released. They are safe and sound, have no injuries or bad health problems. They have been taken to Lagos, Nigeria, where they will have a two-three day course of rehabilitation after which they will travel home," a union spokesman said.
Russian embassy officials are in constant contact with the seamen and as soon as the sailors are ready they will be sent to their homes in Arkhangelsk and Vladivostok.
"The ship-owner and diplomats do not report the concrete terms on which the sailors were released. We only know that in the process of the talks the sides agreed on a certain sum that was paid to the pirates yesterday," a union spokesman said.
Earlier reports said that on May 16 an armed group attacked the North Spirit having a Russian-Ukrainian crew as it was anchored off Cameroon. The pirates abducted the captain, Boris Tersintsev, a resident of Vladivostok, and the senior mechanic, Igor Shumik, a resident of Arkhangelsk. Later the captain called Barthellas Chartering, the Greek company owning the ship, to say that they had been taken to Nigeria.
MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax) - Nigerian law enforcement services have freed the members of the crew of German dry cargo carrier Polonia who were taken prisoner by pirates off Nigeria on Friday, a diplomatic source said on Friday.
"We have received information that our sailors have been rescued from pirate captivity and that they are well. As far as we are aware, they were rescued before the abductors were able to start talks about a ransom. At this moment, we have no information on how many of our sailors were rescued and who specifically," the source told Interfax.
Earlier, Russian television channel Rossiya 24 said all 12 hostages, including seven Russians, had been released. The other sailors are German, Ukrainian, Latvian and Lithuanian.
The pirates attacked the Polonia near an oil terminal in the estuary of the Niger River.
DELHI. July 5 (Interfax) - A Russian woman arrested in Jaypur, India, on June 23 on suspicion of offenses including violation of visa rules has been moved from a police station detention facility to a prison to shield her from alleged pressure from police, said a senior Russian diplomat posted in India.
"Today a court ordered that our fellow citizen be moved from a detention center at a police station in Ropar to a low-security cell in the city prison," Vasily Pronin, head of the consular section of the Russian Embassy to India, told Interfax.
"This is a victory in a sense," Pronin said. "This means she will be protected from pressure that, according to Timoshik, police are putting on her to force her to sign confessionary testimony."
MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax) - Russian relatives of the people arrested in the U.S. on suspicion of spying should apply to the U.S. consulate department for assistance in transferring the suspects' children to their families, said Pavel Astakhov, a Russian commissioner on children's rights.
"A consul should find out where the children are, visit them, tell their relatives what documents they should collect, and supervise the children's handover procedure," Astakhov told Interfax on Saturday.
The U.S. law stipulates that, if a child of an arrested person has relatives willing to accept him, he must be transferred to these relatives, Astakhov said.
Either a court or a social service can make a decision on handing the children over to their relatives, Astakhov said. "Surely, it is necessary to collect and present documents confirming that the relatives are solvent, that they have enough housing space, and so on," he said.
The BBC Russian Service reported earlier that, according to the U.S. prosecution authorities, Natalya Pereverzeva arrested in the U.S. on spying charges had already contacted her relatives in Russia so that they could take custody of her children, one of whom is one and the other three years old.
BLAGOVESHCHENSK. July 5 (Interfax) - Russian President Dmitry Medvedev is set to discuss the possibility of signing a readmission agreement at talks with the Chinese leaders.
"We will talk about it [the readmission agreement] with Chinese partners, we need to revisit this issue," the president said at a meeting that focused on the customs and migration problems in the border regions on Saturday.
"To date, there has been no progress on the readmission issues" in talks with China, and no relevant agreement has been signed yet, said Konstantin Romodanovsky, head of Russia's Federal Migration Service. Nevertheless, the FMS is actively cooperating with its Chinese colleagues, he said. "We managed to convince them that not only do we need to address the migrant workers' issues, we also need to fight illegal migration, which they were initially unenthusiastic about," Romodanovsky said.
"Chinese migration is a special migration issue for the Far East," he said. "I do not see anything dreadful about it that would jeopardize the Russian Federation, this problem simply needs to be addressed efficiently and on a regular basis," he said.
"By early June, Russia registered 248,000 Chinese migrants," Romodanovsky said. "This is the actual figure and does not include only those who might have entered the country before 2008 and are still staying illegally," he said. Of all Chinese migrants in Russia, 86,000 live in the Far East, the FMS chief said.
MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax) - The overwhelming majority of those arrested in the United States on suspicion of spying for Russia may be Russian citizens.
The FBI apprehended ten suspected spies last week. The bureau said that nine suspects might be Russian nationals, the newspaper Kommersant said on Monday.
Juan Lazaro was the first to admit his Russian nationality.
Michael Zotolli and Patricia Mills, a married couple, said late last week their real names were Mikhail Kutsik and Natalia Pereverzeva and asked authorities to send their children to Russia.
By admitting their Russian nationality, the defendants can establish a new contact with their bosses via embassy representatives who must have access to the defendants by law, a former FBI agent told the newspaper. He also noted that the confession would send the detainees' children to the home country instead of an orphanage.
Four married couples had underage children, and none of the children knew what their parents were doing, Assistant Attorney Michael Farbriarz said.
Meanwhile, a representative of the U.S. Department of Justice said he was not ready to say whether the suspects' children were U.S. citizens. He said that social services would consider each case individually.
MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - The S-500 missile-based air defense system currently being developed in Russia will be able to destroy any targets, including those being developed by Russia's potential foes, Maj. Gen. Sergei Popov, the commander of the Russian Air Force's Missile Anti-Aircraft Forces, said on Echo Moskvy radio on Saturday.
"The S-500, a new system being developed now, makes another step that is ahead of our potential enemy's by at least 15-20 years," Popov said.
"Those modern aircraft possessed or being developed by our potential opponents do not pose a great problem even to more or less trained anti-aircraft units," he said.
Igor Asurbeili, the general director of the Almaz-Antei air defense design bureau, had said earlier that the development of the S-500 system should be finished by 2015.
MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax) - Kyrgyzstan reported the largest industrial production growth in the CIS in January-May 2010 (56.8%), the CIS Interstate Statistic Committee said.
The committee explained the year-to-year growth with the resumed operation of the Kumtor gold mine operating at full capacity.
Tajikistan reported industrial production growth of 14.5%; the growth stood at 12.6% in Ukraine; 12.1% in Armenia and 11.9% in Kazakhstan.
Russian industrial production grew by 10.3% in January-May 2010. The growth reached 7.7% in Belarus, 6.1% in Moldova and 4.3% in Azerbaijan.
The committee has no information about industrial production in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in the aforesaid period. The growth stood at 7% in Uzbekistan in the first quarter of the year.
Ukraine had the largest inflation in the CIS, 10.3%. Year-to-year inflation reached 7.6% in Armenia, 7.2% in Kazakhstan, 6.7% in Russia and in Moldova, 6.5% in Belarus, 5.4% in Tajikistan, 4.7% in Azerbaijan and 2.8% in Kyrgyzstan.

Consumer prices in the CIS grew by 7% year-to-year.
ZHUKOVSKY, Moscow region. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - Russian Helicopters Holding will open about 30 service centers abroad in the next decade, its First Deputy General Director Igor Pshenichny said at the Machine Building Technologies 2010 forum in Zhukovsky on Friday.
"The Helicopter Service Company formed by the holding is building a multi-level service network for Russian-made helicopters," he said.
Service is an important element of the holding development strategy, Pshenichny said. He noted that the holding aspired for controlling 15% of the world helicopter market by 2020. Today the holding produces 7-8% of all helicopters in the world.
"The world is using about 7,000 helicopters. We must not forget about that," he said.
There are four Russian helicopter service centers based in India, China, Vietnam and the United Arab Emirates and one helicopter repair plant in Latin America. The holding will open five service centers and a regional logistic center in Latin America, seven service centers and one regional center in Asia, three centers in Africa and two in Europe by 2015, he said.
MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - There will be no replacement for the Coronas Photon solar research satellite, which malfunctioned last year and was removed from the Russian orbiting cluster on Wednesday, for another five years, an aerospace sector representative told Interfax-AVN.
"We are fulfilling a federal space program for the period until 2015. No one is going to amend that program, because there will be no funds for new projects. The available funds for the Coronas Photon project will not be enough for building a new space vehicle," he said.
Coronas Photon was put into orbit on January 30, 2009, and sprang into life on February 26, 2009. The first month in orbit yielded about 10,000 solar images in both the X-ray and ultraviolet range.
The vehicle's batteries went flat in late November 2009 because they had not been recharged for a long time. Scientific instruments stopped functioning and contact with the spacecraft was lost.
MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - Russia is hoping to send the Venera-D probe to the planet within the next decade to replicate the success of Soviet automated interplanetary probes, Director of the Russian Academy of Sciences' Space Research Institute Academician Lev Zelyony told Interfax-AVN.
"Venera-D is one of our future projects. It will be interesting from the scientific and technological points of view. We wish to reproduce the success of the 1970s. Venera-D will soon enter the designer stage," he said.
The interplanetary mission plan is still unclear, the academician said. "Institute staff have diverse opinions. Our French partners will take part in the project, but they have no common opinion either. However, the Russian space program for the period until 2020 will certainly include this project, and we hope it will be successful," he aid.
Venera-D will study Venus's atmosphere and surface and reasons why there is no water on the planet. The letter D signifies the long duration of the mission, i.e. comprehensive atmospheric studies. Bearing in mind the aggressiveness of Venus's atmosphere (high pressure and temperatures), the landing vehicle may be operational for several days or even hours.
The probe will be made up of the orbiter, the landing vehicle and two tanks. The orbiter will collect atmospheric data and transfer it back to Earth.
ZHUKOVSKY, Moscow region. July 2 (Interfax-AVN) - Arms and military hardware will be supplied to the national subdivisions of the Collective Security Treaty Organization's Collective Rapid Reaction Force (CSTO KSOR) at concessional prices, First Deputy Director of the Federal Service for Military Technical Cooperation (FSMTC) Alexander Fomin told Interfax-AVN.
"All bilateral and multilateral supplies will be made at the CSTO prices. This mechanism has already been tested," said Fomin, commenting on the results of an international conference, which focused on the supply of modern and compatible weapons to the CSTO KSOR.
The most advanced models of weapons and military hardware made in the CSTO countries will enter service in the KSOR upon mutual approval by the member states, he said. "The task is to take the best what can be offered by Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and other CSTO countries. The most important thing is to unify, harmonize and make compatible all types of weapons," Fomin said.
To be able to contain conflicts in any particular member state, the KSOR must be equipped with special weapons and hardware, including non-lethal weapons, he said. "It is important to promptly react to the epicenters of such threats to prevent them from getting more dangerous and widespread," Fomin said.
The recent events in southern Kyrgyzstan are an example of such threats, he said.
ZHUKOVSKY, Moscow region. July 2 (Interfax-AVN) - Alexei Fyodorov, head of Russia's United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), has said he does not rule out that India could order more Sukhoi Su-30MKI multifunction fighter jets from Russia in the near future.
"The chance of India buying another batch of Su-30MKI planes is quite real. As far as we know, the Indian side needs them. We hope that all this will evolve into a concrete order in the near future," Fyodorov told Interfax-AVN on the sidelines of the Engineering Technologies 2010 international forum in Zhukovsky, outside Moscow, on Friday.
The number of fighter jets India could order from Russia is quite large, and it will keep enterprises of the Irkut corporation busy for nearly the whole of next year, he said.
Commenting on whether or not Malaysia could purchase more Sukhoi Su-30MKM fighter jets from Russia, the official said that the Malaysian government had not yet decided what it would buy and when.
"If they decide to purchase multifunction combat airplanes, we will certainly be among the main potential suppliers," he said.
Malaysia successfully uses 18 Su-30MKM fighter jets purchased from Russia earlier, he said.
The Indian cabinet agreed to allocate $3.235 billion to purchase 42 Su-30MKI fighter jets from Russia.
MOSCOW. July 2 (Interfax) - Russian state nuclear materials exporter Techsnabexport (Tenex) expects to boost its export order book more than 50% to $30 billion by 2020, the company said in its annual report.
By then, Tenex plans to be meeting at least a quarter of the needs of the world's nuclear reactors for uranium enrichment services, and to double its presence in the Asia-Pacific market.
Efforts to improve the trade environment for Russian uranium in the key markets need to be sustained for this to be achieved, Tenex said.
The export contracts portfolio for five years in advance exceeded $8 billion in 2009, not including shipments under the megatons-to- megawatts deal, by which Russia ships highly enriched uranium (HEU) removed from dismantled nuclear warheads to the United States in diluted form suitable for nuclear power pant fuel. The overall portfolio of long-term contracts, including for delivery after 2010, was estimated at $18 billion.
Tenex ships nuclear materials via the [port of St Petersburg, among others. It mostly uses the Northern Shipping Company (RTS: SEMP) and Atlantic Ro-Ro Carriers to ship materials to Europe and the United States.
The company's logistics partners are Transport Logistics International (U.S.), Nuclear Cargo+Service (Germany), TN Internationale (France) and Uranium Asset Management (UK).
Tuenex said its turnover could rise 11.6% this year to $3.85 billion from $3.45 billion. Europe accounted for $1.5 billion of turnover in 2009, North America - $1 billion and Asia (China, Japan and South Korea) - $500 million.
Tenex's share of the world market is an estimated 40%.
Tenex said uranium-related sales revenue rose 81.5% in 2009 to 76.346 billion rubles, after it switched to a purely contractual basis for delivery. The company received 30% of its revenue in the form of commission in 2008. Exchange-rate factors also influenced revenue.
At the same time, commercial uranium exports fell 8.8% last year to $2.011 billion because these had jumped the year before, due mainly to a supplementary shipment of materials to U.S. firm Palmco ($116 million in 2008) following an arbitration court ruling.
Shipments under the megatons-megawatts deal grew 8.3% to $886 million in 2009 as the cost of services to dilute the HEU rose. All proceeds from this contract go into the Russian budget.
Net profit rose 150% last year to 14.5 billion rubles and consolidated income grew 90% to 80.3 billion rubles.
Tenex expects quotas to re-export the Russian low-enriched uranium (LEU) via the U.S. to be eased. An anti-dumping duty used to prevent Tenex from signing direct LEU supply contracts with U.S. power companies, and an agreement was reached in 2008 to enable Tenex to raise direct shipments gradually, to 20%.
But the re-export restriction, imposed in the early 1990s, remains in place, and talks to relax this quota are under way, Rosatom told Interfax.
Tenex said also that Russian shipments had been subject to stealth quotas in Europe, but that permanent dialog with EU energy and Euratom had eased this problem for a while.
Tenex could take up more than half the quota it has agreed to for direct LEU shipments to the United States by 2020 by the end of this year or early next year, the company's chief, Alexei Grigoryev, has told Interfax. Grigoryev has said Tenex had signed $4.3 billion worth of long-term uranium contracts with U.S. companies to date.
Approximately half of all U.S. reactors work on Russian LEU, derived from weapons-grade uranium.
Tenex also said in the annual report that U.S. firm ConverDyn agreed to open U308 and uranium hexafluoride material resource accounts for the Russian company's Frankfurt-based Internexco subsidiary in 2009. Internexco, established in 1989, saw record sales revenue and net profit of EUR 375.2 million and EUR 6.7 million, respectively, last year.
Internexco signed a new long-term contract with a European customer to 2020.
Tenex registered the London-based subsidiary Tradewill Limited in June 2009 to promote nuclear goods and services under the Tenex brand and exported by other Rosatom organizations in the world market.
ZHUKOVSKY, Moscow region. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - A Russian-Ukrainian joint venture will draft proposals on the integration of the United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) and the Antonov Corporation and will promote Antonov aircraft on the market.
"The joint venture with Ukraine is due to be formed by October 1. We have agreed to set up the joint venture of the UAC and Antonov rather than establish a new company," UAC President Alexei Fyodorov said at the Machine Building Technologies 2010 forum in Zhukovsky.
Ukraine will buy 50% in UAC Civil Aircraft for 12.5 million rubles. The company's charter capital will amount to 25 million rubles.
The joint venture will fulfill Antonov projects, among them An-140, An-148, An-124 and, possibly, An-70, Fyodorov said.
"The joint venture will concentrate on the drafting of proposals on the integration of the UAC and Antonov so that a single company could be formed in the future," he said.
In addition, the joint venture "will do the marketing, sell and provide maintenance [to Antonov aircraft] and ensure cooperation with partners," he added.
MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - Planned docking on Friday between a Russian supply spacecraft and the International Space Station was aborted as the space freighter missed the ISS and started rotating uncontrollably, the Russian mission control told Interfax-AVN.
The Progress M-06M "is moving away from us and running ahead toward the [Zvezda service module]," ISS commander Alexander Skvortsov told the mission control. He said he could see the Progress "rotating uncontrollably." "I can't see the freighter, it's gone ahead," he said.
A mission control spokesman told Interfax-AVN docking might be put off. He did not say what had gone wrong with the Progress.
MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - The docking of the Progress M-06M cargo spacecraft to the International Space Station has been postponed by almost 24 hours, the Mission Control Center (MCC) told Interfax on Friday.
"Most likely, the docking will be postponed by 24 hours," an MCC official said.
The docking initially scheduled for today was going smoothly when a failure caused the ship to pass by the station, he said.
Efforts to correct the situation have failed even after switching to the so-called teleoperator control mode, that is a manual mode operated by astronauts themselves.
MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax-AV) - A commission will be set up to investigate the breakdown and failed docking of the Progress-M-06M cargo spacecraft to the International Space Station.
"Due to the incident, a commission will be formed consisting of specialists from the Rocket Space Corporation Energia and representatives from the Central Research Institute of Machine-Building, which includes the Mission Control Center," a Corporation Energia official told Interfax-AVN.
The commission will attempt to investigate the incident within the shortest period of time, the company official said.
On Friday the Progress M-06M ship passed by the station due to an automatics failure. The astronauts failed to take control over the spacecraft and to perform the manual docking.
This is a second consecutive non-standard docking of a Progress series ship to the ISS. On May 1 the cargo ship had to be docked to the ISS manually.
MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - Russia's space mission control tentatively set a second attempt to dock the International Space Station with Russian supply spacecraft Progress M-06M for Sunday after the first attempt on Friday ended in failure, with the Progress missing the ISS, Vitaly Davydov, deputy head of the Federal Space Agency, said at the mission control.
A mission control spokesman told Interfax-AVN, however, that the docking attempt might be put off until Monday.
He said the source of the trouble was the Kurs automated docking system, which had also run into problems when the previous supply craft was trying to dock with the station in May.
Earlier on Friday, a mission control official told the ISS crew: "At this point, please have your dinner. Docking has been canceled. Nor is any work being done on the Progress. But please stay in contact."
A mission control spokesman told Interfax-AVN the Progress had passed the station at "a safe distance" of about 3 kilometers.
"The crew of the station was unable to take over control of the spacecraft when it became clear that the automated system was out of order," he said.
ISS commander Alexander Skvortsov said he could see the Progress "rotating uncontrollably."
KOROLYOV, Moscow Region. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - The cause of Friday's abortive operation to dock Russian supply spacecraft Progress M-06M with the International Space Station was a radio contact glitch in one of the docking systems, a deputy head of the Federal Space Agency said after a successful second docking attempt on Sunday.
However, the Progress' new digital control system had not been the source of the trouble, agency deputy chief Vitaly Davydov told reporters at the mission control outside Moscow.
"A commission is working on the cause of the unstable contact. We will definitely get to the source of the unstable contact within the next two weeks," said the president of the Energia rocket and space corporation, Vitaly Lopota.
MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - A Russian supply spacecraft docked with the International Space Station on Sunday after an unsuccessful docking operation on Friday in which it missed the ISS, a spokesman for the Russian mission control said.
Sunday's docking operation was carried through by an automated, the spokesman told Interfax-AVN.
On Friday, the Kurs automated docking system went out of order when the Progress was between 2 and 3 kilometers from the ISS, and an attempt by the station crew to use the manual docking control system was also unsuccessful. The supply craft missed the station and moved away from it.
DELHI. July 5 (Interfax) - India will modernize 50 Sukhoi Su-30 MKI fighters with help from the Russian United Aircraft Corporation within the next three to four years, an Indian Defense Ministry spokesman said ion Sunday.
The project is part of a program to modernize the aircraft fleet of the country's air force, the spokesman told Interfax.
Around five of the 50 jets would be modernized at the facilities of Russian aircraft manufacturer Irkut (RTS: IRKT). The others would be modernized at Indian facilities, the spokesman said.
ZHUKOVSKY, Moscow region. July 5 (Interfax) - The Russian budget has not allocated funds for acquisition of Israeli drones and French Mistral ships for the Russian Armed Forces, Alexander Yemelyanov, head of Rosoboronexport's delegation at the Technologies In Mechanical Engineering forum, told journalists on Thursday.
"For us to be able to acquire [foreign weapons] for the Russian army, such acquisition has to be stipulated in a government defense order. The decision is made by the president, not the defense ministry. There must be a line in the government defense order," Yemelyanov said.
"So far there are neither such lines, nor decisions," he said.
ALICANTE, Spain. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - Russian helicopter builders will supply a Mistral ship with Kamov Ka-27M, Ka-52 and Ka-226 helicopters if the Defense Ministry approves the ship's purchase, First Deputy Managing Director of the Kumertau Aviation Plant Vyacheslav Kovalyov told Interfax-AVN on Monday.
"The state armaments program stipulates the purchase of a dozen helicopters for the ship. That would be Kamov Ka-27M, Ka-52 and Ka-226," he said.
A Mistral visited St. Petersburg last year, and Kamov Ka-27 and Ka-52 made a test landing on the ship, he said.
The plant has almost designed the Ka-27M, which will perform search and rescue missions, Kovalyov said. "The Defense Ministry has a keen interest in the Ka-52 bearing in mind the possible acquisition of the Mistral," he said.
Meanwhile, a defense industry source told Interfax-AVN that the Defense Ministry planned to order up to 100 helicopters for new helicopter ships.
ALICANTE, Spain. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - Many countries are interested in buying Russia's Kamov Ka-32A11VS helicopters for putting out forest and city fires, First Deputy Managing Director of the Kumertau Aviation Plant Vyacheslav Kovalyov told Interfax-AVN.
"Thirteen Ka-32 have been supplied to Spain since 2004, and they want to order one or two helicopters next year. As a rule, the orders are made before the wildfire season. We were unable to fulfill the orders earlier because of the long production cycle. Now we produce helicopters in advance and can meet the demand," he said.
Apart from Spain, the Ka-32A11VS are sold to Portugal, South Korea, Vietnam, Malaysia, Laos, Canada, Algeria and Iran. "South Korea is the No 1 client. It has about 70 [Ka-32A11VS]. We have dispatched another helicopter [to South Korea] and have orders for three more," he said.
Canada is mostly using the Ka-32A11VS for carrying precious timber. "Algeria and Iran have one helicopter each. Negotiations are under way with Arab countries," Kovalyov said.
Experts proclaim that the Ka-32A11VS is the best fire-fighting helicopter. It displays unique characteristics in putting out fires, especially in mountainous areas or on the upper stories of high-rises in densely populated city districts.
MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - A delegation of the Ukrainian General Staff has been invited to observe part of the Vostok 2010 strategic exercises at the Tsugol training range of the Siberian military district in the Trans-Baikal region, district press secretary Valery Shcheblanin told Interfax-AVN.
"The Ukrainian servicemen will be informed about the progress of Vostok 2010 and will observe part of the exercise," he said.
Deputy General Staff Chief Lt. Gen. Hryhoriy Sadovsky leads the delegation, Shcheblanin said.
ZHUKOVSKY, Moscow region. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - Integration of the Russia-India BrahMos supersonic missile with the Sukhoi Su-30MKI multi-role fighter jet may start in the near future, Machine Building Research and Production Center leading designer Igor Kharlamov told Interfax-AVN on Friday, at the Machine Building Technologies 2010 forum in Zhukovsky.
"A contract on the BrahMos integration with the Su-30MKI is being drafted. It will be presented to Indian partners soon," he said.
The draft contract enumerates prospective works and estimates their cost, as well as the deadline for testing BrahMos missiles within the Su-30MKI system.
"The Indian Air Force will assign two jets for the testing and develop the missile launcher for integrating the missile into the plane system. All types of land and flight tests will be done, and a report will be drafted on the system worthiness," he said.
The works may take 30 months. The works will start as soon as the contract is signed and the funding begins.
ASTANA/MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax) - Russia and Kazakhstan will sign an agreement on marketing policy in the nuclear sector two months from now, Russia's Rosatom corporation said.
The understanding was reached in Astana on Monday, where Rosatom and Kazakh national nuclear corporation Kazatomprom signed documents, including an agreement to alter then format for cooperation under the auspices of the Uranium Enrichment Center joint venture. Now, instead of building new enrichment capacity, Kazakhstan will receive a stake in an existing Russian enrichment plant, namely the Urals Electrochemicals Combine in Novouralsk.
They also agreed to draft a joint sales and marketing policy for the joint venture and to sign a separate agreement to cover that.
Russia and Kazakhstan also signed a memorandum on integration and the development of cooperation, in which they affirm their commitment to forming a consolidated nuclear industry company on an equal basis.
The first step towards forming this company will be the joint sale of natural and low-enriched uranium, and other products and services for Russian-Kazakh joint ventures.
"This is a comprehensive agreement. The first is on joint participation in the enrichment plant. It's what we agreed on long ago, and the implementation of previously approved plans for global integration. We agreed we would not build a new plant because this would take too long. It would be more comfortable for the Kazakh partners to participate in an existing Russian plant, which will be our biggest one in Novouralsk, where we'll transfer some shares to Kazatomprom," Rosatom chief Sergei Kiriyenko told reporters.
The Rosatom and Kazatomprom chiefs also briefed the presidents of the two countries on preparations to build a first VVER-300 reactor in Kazakhstan under the auspices of a joint venture.
Kiriyenko said Kazakhstan had not yet decided where the new nuclear power plant would be located.
"These are all further steps towards accomplishing the mission that our presidents gave us a few years ago to integrate the Russian and Kazkah nuclear industries. We're even doing what we agreed a little ahead of schedule," Kiriyenko said.
The first products of nuclear cooperation between Russia and Kazakhstan were the formation of uranium mining joint ventures. Russia's Atomredmetzoloto (ARMZ) is handing its stakes in these joint ventures to Canada's Uranium One in exchange for control over this company.
Plans emerged in 2008 to create a consolidated nuclear company, however talks were protracted, partly due to Kazakhstan's position, a Rosatom source has said, and Russia had also lost interest in this project.
MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax) - Russia wishes economic integration with Ukraine in many sectors, including atomic machine building, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said at a meeting of the government presidium.
"We are ready to use the capacities of Ukrainian machine building plants in fulfilling nuclear power plant construction and modernization projects in our countries and in third states," he said.
"Russia is also interested in repairing and building ships together with Ukrainian shipyards," he said.
ZHUKOVSKY, Moscow region. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - A large shipment of Russian BMP-3 armored personnel carriers to Greece is possible no earlier than in two years, head of the Rosoboronexport delegation to the Machine Building Technologies forum Alexander Yemelyanov told reporters on Thursday.
"There is an intergovernmental agreement on the delivery of a large number of BMP-3 vehicles to Greece. The drafting of a contract was in progress when the crisis began, and the process slowed down. I do not think the work can resume within the next two years," he said.
The contract will depend on Greece's ability to cope with economic problems and the political will of the Greek government to buy armaments, he said.
"It is difficult to make a forecast," Yemelyanov concluded.
ZHUKOVSKY, Moscow region. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - It is possible to deliver Iskander-E tactical missile systems to Syria after the local demand is fully met, head of the Rosoboronexport delegation to the Machine Building Technologies forum Alexander Yemelyanov said on Thursday.
"It is necessary to wait a bit, and the Syrians know that," he said in reply to an Interfax-AVN question.
Plants producing Iskander systems will soon be working for the Russian Defense Ministry, he said.
Yemelyanov did not rule out future deliveries to Syria.
Syria asked Russia to sell the systems several years ago, but Moscow abstained from delivering offensive armaments to Damascus.
The Iskander-E takeoff weight is 3,800 kilograms, including 480 kilograms of payload. The system is capable of hitting targets at a range of 280 kilometers and destroying two targets at an interval of one minute.
ZHUKOVSKY (Moscow region). July 1 (Interfax-AVN) - The decision on the supply of Russian helicopters to Afghanistan is current at the stage of working consultations, Russia's permanent representative to NATO Dmitry Rogozin told Interfax-AVN.
"Such agreements should be reached with regard for the commercial component. Providing assistance to the poor Afghanistan is one thing, but if it's a project related to NATO, a joint project, a decision on it should be made on the commercial basis," Rogozin told reporters on Thursday.
The decision on the supply of helicopters to Afghanistan has not been taken off the agenda, he said. "Putting it mildly, the issue has entered the stage of working consultations," Rogozin said.
Rogozin earlier said that "Russia will soon make a decision on the transfer of military helicopters to Afghanistan." "It will be made very soon," he said during a televised linkup from Brussels in May 2010.
At the same time, Rogozin reiterated that Russia will link this issue to the permission for direct sales of Russian weapons to NATO countries.
"We intend to seek a direct opportunity to trade in our military-technical products with the NATO countries," he said.
Rogozin recalled that the request to supply Russian helicopters to Afghanistan came from NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen during his visit to Moscow in early 2010.
Rogozin added that Russia would like to tie this issue to a broader context.
"If we are now actively discussing the possibility of the Mistral deal with France, the following question arises: we can buy helicopter carriers, but we can't sell helicopters to France," Rogozin said.
ZHUKOVSKY. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - Russian defense enterprises are interested in selling and buying modern technologies that are essential for the creation of competitive samples of weapons and military equipment.
"One of the reasons why we are holding this forum is to draw companies to offer interesting technologies that we would buy," Konstantin Biryullin, deputy director of the Federal Service on Military-Technical Cooperation (FSVTS), told Interfax-AVN at the international forum Technologies in Machine-Building 2010 held in Zhukovsky, Moscow region.
Biryullin said it is a very important issue because the export component depends on the level of technologies used in the development and production of military equipment.
SEVASTOPOL. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - The Black Sea guard ship Smetlivy has taken part in the Ukrainian naval parade marking the National Fleet Day, which was held in Sevastopol on July 4, Vyacheslav Trukhachyov, Black Sea Fleet press secretary told Interfax on Monday.
"In response to this, Russia offered the Ukrainian Navy the chance to present its ship at the Black Sea parade held in honor of Navy Day," Trukhachyov said.
Trukhachyov said the Ukrainian Navy has already decided that the frigate Hetman Sagaidychniy will take part in the Black Sea parade.
On July 2, the Ukrainian parliament sent an inquiry to President Viktor Yanukovych regarding the possibility of returning to joint celebrations of the Navy Day by Russia and Ukraine. Under Ukraine's former President Viktor Yushchenko, a separate day was chosen for Navy Day.
Russian Fleet Day is traditionally marked on the last Sunday of July, when Soviet Navy Day was marked.
BISHKEK. July 2 (Interfax) - Usen Sadykov, the leader of the party Zhany Kyrgyzstan and one of the key figures accused of organizing the mass unrest in Kyrgyzstan on May 12-14, has been released from prison and subjected to house arrest.
"The court has taken into account our reasons, including the defendant's illness, age, poor condition, and his promise not to leave the republic as long as the investigation continues and until his trial is completed," lawyer Tayana Chilnikina told Interfax.
Kyrgyz special services and law enforcement agencies have charged Sadykov, who was earlier an advisor to former President Kurmanbek Bakiyev, with organizing and financing the unrest involving seizures of administrative buildings in Bishkek, Jalal-Abad, and Osh on May 12-14.
Despite the fact that Sadykov is now older than 70, the court had earlier granted a request by special services that Sadykov be taken into custody and held at the National Security Service detention center.
Sadykov was arrested not far from Jalal-Abad on May 16, 2010.

"We appreciate the constructive position of the United States on Ukrainian-Russian relations. It is very important for us. A constructive strategic relationship with Russia would create all the conditions that are needed to integrate Ukraine with the European Union," Yanukovych said at a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Kyiv.
"I would like to confirm my invitation for the U.S. president, Barack Obama, to visit Ukraine when this is convenient for him," Yanukovych said, adding that he would be able to visit the United States in the second half of 2010.
TSKHINVALI, South Ossetia. July 5 (Interfax) - South Ossetia's president, who is serving his second term, promised not to seek a change to the republic's constitution to permit him to be elected for the third presidential term.
South Ossetia's constitution prohibits the same person from holding presidential office for more than two terms running.
"I want to declare that I am not going to seek to persuade or press people, least of all parliament, to make changes to the constitution about the third term," Eduard Kokoity, whose term expires next year, told a congress in the capital Tskhinvali of the republic's Unity party.
"It is not Eduard Kokoity as an individual that is the issue but the prestige of South Ossetia," Kokoity said.
"We are a young normal civilized modern state. And we are not going to change the basic law of our republic to please anyone - everything will be in compliance with the constitution. There will be no manipulation concerning the third term. But this doesn't mean that we must change the course or the strategy that we have been following until now," Kokoity said.
KYIV. July 5 (Interfax) - Ukraine's President Viktor Yanukovych has confirmed the country's course towards the European integration.
"Ukraine's course towards the European integration has no alternative and there have never been any doubts about that," he said at a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
Hopefully, the United States will support Ukraine on this path, he said.
"[Ukraine] is prepared to continue its relations with NATO in the context of the Ukrainian army reform and joint participation in peacekeeping counter-terrorist measures," he also said.
At the meeting he raised the issue of cooperating in the framework of Euro-Atlantic security. Ukraine is keen to develop relations in modernizing security systems in the European and Euro-Atlantic space, he said.
Yanukovych thanked the U.S. for the last year publishing of the Budapest Memorandum providing security assurances for Ukraine. "We are certainly keen to continue the dialog with the U.S., aimed at working out a mutually acceptable formula of providing stronger security assurances to Ukraine," the president said.
Ukraine is pursuing a non-aligned policy aimed at preventing the appearance of new divisive lines on the European continent, Yanukovych said.
CHISINAU. July 5 (Interfax) - Moldova's ruling liberal coalition decided on Friday to call a referendum for September 5 to choose whether the president is to be elected through a vote in parliament, as has been the case until now, or through a national vote.
However, the four member parties of the ruling Alliance for European Integration (AIE) were unable to reach a consensus on the date for the dissolution of the current parliament, which made two abortive attempts to elect the president last year.
The AIE decided to set the parliament disbandment date after the referendum, when it becomes clear which presidential election procedure the country will have.
KYIV. July 5 (Interfax) - Ukraine and the United States are studying the possibility of optimizing their energy cooperation, in particular, nuclear energy and energy production.
"Today we have agreed to step up our efforts to attract the U.S. experience and investment in the energy sector, which is our priority. Prospective areas include, in particular, energy resources production and cooperation in modernizing the Ukrainian gas transportation system (GTS)," Ukraine's Foreign Minister Kostyantyn Hryshchenko said at a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Kyiv on Friday.
The parties also discussed cooperation in diversifying nuclear fuel sources for Ukrainian nuclear power plants and increasing the safety at the existing nuclear power units, the minister said.
Energy sector is an important area of the U.S.-Ukrainian bilateral cooperation, said Clinton. An energy sector based on transparency, market prices and efficiency could put an end to high-profile crises on the Ukrainian energy market and provide big control over the future of the energy sector, including through the creation of a transparent international energy sector based on the Ukrainian resources, as has already been discussed between the two countries' presidents, the U.S. Secretary of State said.
ASTANA. July 5 (Interfax) - Kyrgyzstan is grateful to the Eurasian Economic Community (EurAsEC) for its assistance, Kyrgyz President Roza Otunbayeva has said.

At the same time she said that Kyrgyzstan is determined "to help itself and does not need any handouts".
YEREVAN. July 5 (Interfax) - Armenia views its relations with the United States as a factor of regional stability and development, Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan told U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Sunday.
"We view a high level of bilateral relations as a key factor of national economic and political development and regional peace and stability," he said.
"The settlement of the Karabakh conflict in keeping with international laws is the most important problem of the Armenian people. The people of Karabakh have the right to develop and to choose their future on the native land," he said.
"That is an unswerving right, and many peoples in the world are happy now because they have used it," he said.
Sargsyan praised the U.S. efforts in the Karabakh settlement process, a source at the Armenian presidential administration told Interfax. "Thank you for your assistance," he told Clinton.
He also thanked U.S. President Barack Obama for assisting normalization of Armenia-Turkey relations.
"Although the Turks were not ready and are still not ready for establishing relations with Armenia without preconditions, the U.S. attitude is extremely important for us," Sargsyan said.
Clinton said she was honored to visit Armenia, especially on U.S. Independence Day.

The Ukrainian sailor was given medical aid and returned to the ship, ministry press secretary Oleksandr Dykusarov told Interfax with reference to the Ukrainian embassy in Nigeria and the Polonia operator.
The twelve crewmembers of the Polonia were set free on July 4, he said, referring to the German consul general in Lagos, Nigeria.

ASTANA. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - Kazakhstan will build a satellite assembly and testing center in Astana in 2012 to produce all types of satellites for local and foreign clients together with France's EADS Astrium, Kazakhstan Garysh Sapary President Gabdullatif Myrzakulov told Interfax.
The company is a component of the Kazakh Space Agency.
"The prospective center will enable Kazakhstan to assemble all types of satellites, such as optical, radar and telecommunications. I would not call it a 'screwdriver' factory," he said.
"True, main parts will be manufactured in France, although we may have some other suppliers whose products have proven their value. We will be assembling and testing satellites," he noted.
Kazakhstan's contribution to the work will grow eventually, from 10% in 2014 to 40% in 2020, mostly with software, Myrzakulov said.
The center will be producing three satellites in two years at first, and will reach its full capacity by 2015, he noted. Final production parameters of the center are yet unknown.
The agreement on building the satellite assembly and testing center was signed during a Kazakh visit of French President Nicolas Sarkozy on October 6, 2009.
He told Interfax later that EADS Astrium would build the Astana center by the end of 2012. EADS Astrium will have 27.5% in the joint venture, and the rest will belong to Kazakhstan.
ASTANA. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - Kazakhstan Garysh Sapary, a component of the Kazakh Space Agency, will build a telecom satellite for CIS Central Asian states by 2018, Company President Gabdullatif Myrzakulov said.
"We will start building a regional telecom satellite for CIS member countries in 2018. This project will ensure effective use of orbit frequency resources of Central Asian states," he told Interfax.
"We will coordinate the idea with regional neighbors" within six to seven years, he added.
The Kazakh satellite assembly and testing center may cost 131 million euros, Myrzakulov said.
"EADS Astrium will bear almost a third of the expenditures," he added.
KYIV. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - The wages of Ukrainian officers and military pilots will double beginning on October 1, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych said during the celebrations of the Ukrainian Fleet day in Sevastopol on Sunday.
"Our task is to create a strong fleet ready to react appropriately to modern challenges and threats. We should revive Ukraine's power as a strong sea state," Yanukovych said aboard the Ukrainian frigate Hetman Sagaidachniy, the presidential press service has reported.
Yanukovych said the development of the Ukrainian fleet should become a top priority for all branches of the Ukrainian administration.
"I am convinced that we can restore the shipbuilding industry in the nearest future and sailors will get modern ships and weapons," Yanukovych said.
STEPANAKERT. July 2 (Interfax) - Any attempts to change the format of the OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) Minsk Group will have an adverse effect on the Karabakh conflict settlement process, said Bako Sahakyan, President of the breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR).
The full-format negotiations must resume, with Artsakh (the self-designation of Nagorno Karabakh) participating on an equal basis, Sahakyan said at a meeting with OSCE Minsk co-chairmen Robert Bradtke (the United States) and Igor Popov (Russia) in Stepanakert on Friday, the NCR president's press office told Interfax
The co-chairmen concurred with him, having stressed that it was only a matter of time, the press office said. The parties also dismissed a force-based conflict resolution as absolutely unacceptable.
Azerbaijan's destructive steps are the biggest impediment to the peaceful conflict resolution, the NCR president said. The international community has failed to react to recent breaches of a cease-fire agreement, thus toughening Azerbaijan's position even more.
"The independence and safety of Artsakh are not a subject of trade, and any attempt to bring back the past may have unpredictable implications," the NCR leader said.
TBILISI. July 5 (Interfax) - Georgia's new Cabinet has approved a governmental strategy plan with respect to its "occupied territories" [Abkhazia and South Ossetia] at its first meeting on Saturday.
The action plan covers those specific mechanisms that are needed for the governmental strategy to become more than just ideas on a paper, Georgia's State Minister Temur Yakobashvili told journalists after the meeting.
Efforts will be stepped up in four key areas, he said. "These are the humanitarian sphere; the human sphere which covers human relations with both sides in the 'occupied territories;' the social sphere focused mainly on education, health care and environment protection; and the economic sphere, including trade and business," Yakobashvili said.
To implement specific projects, we are planning to create tools such as a coordination mechanism with a neutral status, neutral certification and road document, trust fund, a joint investment fund, a cooperation agency and an integrated social and economic zone, the state minister said.
"There will also be an adequate financial instrument that will ensure the realization of the projects necessary for developing humanitarian, social, trade and business relations," Yakobashvili said.
Work over these documents will start tomorrow "so that by the end of the year we have specific results," he said.

"The Korsakov patrol ship stopped the Sakhalin Bataysk fishing vessel within the limits of the Russian exclusive economic zone, southeast of Cape Aniva [southern Sakhalin], on Sunday. The vessel flies the Russian flag; it is registered in Nevelsk and has the crew of 14 Russians. The ship was carrying 14 tonnes of live crab. The crew did not have a crab fishing license," he said.
The fishing boat was brought to the Korsakov port for examination. The captain was charged with a breach of rules in the Russian exclusive economic zone, and the ship was detained.
In all, the Sakhalin Coast Guard stopped criminal activities of three groups of persons and seized 48 vessels, including 35 foreign, for breaching border and environmental rules in January-June 2010. Sixty-one border trespassers and 203 violators of border rules were taken into custody.

BISHKEK. July 2 (Interfax) - The European Union will send more humanitarian supplies worth seven million euros to Kyrgyzstan, Kristalina Georgieva, EU Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid, International Cooperation and Crisis Response, said at a news conference in Bishkek on Friday.
The EU was among the first organizations to provide humanitarian aid worth five million euros for the people affected by the ethnic clashes in Osh and Jalal-Abad, she said.
Georgieva said that during her visit to Kyrgyzstan, she would collect all the necessary information and forward it to the European Commission, which would decide how to distribute the planned seven million euros as effectively as possible.
The EU commissioner said she would travel to the city of Osh in the south of Kyrgyzstan on Saturday.
The EU currently plans to spend the financial aid on projects to restore local healthcare institutions and infrastructure, as well as on confidence building measures between the Uzbek and Kyrgyz communities in the south of the republic, she said.
MOSCOW. July 2 (Interfax) - U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Beyrle has said he hopes that Russian-U.S. relations will see a lot of exciting achievements in the future.
Speaking at the Fourth of July reception at the Spaso-House residence on Friday, Beyrle said he expected the next 12 months to add many unforgettable emotions and substantial concrete achievements to relations between the two states.
A similar reception took place at the U.S. ambassador's residence in Moscow a year ago ahead of President Barack Obama's visit to Russia, while this year's reception comes just a few days after Russian President Dmitry Medvedev's visit to the United States, which was very productive, the diplomat said.
These two events are separated by 12 months of great success and major achievements in relations between Russia and the U.S., including the signing of the new START and the launch of a bilateral presidential commission, which is a very dynamic format for cooperation, Beyrle said.
Serious commercial deals were also signed, including between Russia's state corporation Rostekhnologii (Russian Technologies) and Boeing, he said.
However, there was one event that symbolized the renewal of Russia-U.S. consolidation, Beyrle said.
Russian people applauded as U.S. troops marched under a U.S. flag during the Victory Day military parade in Red Square in Moscow on May 9, he said.
KYIV. July 2 (Interfax) - U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Friday declined to comment on the current spy scandal in which 10 people have been arrested in the United States and one more person in Cyprus as a suspected ring spying for Russia.
Clinton, who was speaking at a news conference in Kyiv, refused to comment on the scandal before the U.S. justice authorities have finished investigating it. She said American President Barack Obama had spoken in the same vein.
Washington has expressed hope the scandal would not obstruct positive developments that have been a feature of U.S.-Russian relations since Obama moved into the White House.
KYIV. July 5 (Interfax) - The United States is grateful to Ukraine for demonstrated leadership in renouncing highly-enriched uranium.
The U.S. and Ukraine continue to work over Ukraine's historical decision to remove highly-enriched uranium from its territory before 2012; the U.S. thanks the Ukrainian President for the leadership he showed at the recent Nuclear Security Summit in Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a press statement at a press conference held jointly by Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych in Kyiv on Friday.
The U.S. also hails the decision by Verkhovna Rada to allow foreign troops to hold military exercises in its territory, she said.
Clinton also thanked Ukraine for cooperation with NATO.
Ukraine has effectively begun the process of renouncing highly-enriched uranium, said Yanukovych.
"Preparations are underway, which should result in a one-off removal of highly-enriched uranium and the import of low-enriched uranium, technologies and equipment for our research centers," the president said.
This is necessary not only for scientific studies, "it is in line with Ukraine's desire to extend the non-nuclear zone on the Earth," he said.
Ukraine is proposing to hold an international conference in 2011 on the grounds of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, which will continue to address the agenda of the Washington summit, he said.
BAKU. July 5 (Interfax) - U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has recognized progress in the Karabakh settlement and called on the sides to refrain from the use of force and to observe the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act.
We believe progress has been made already, she said at a press conference in Baku at the end of her visit.
She said that Azerbaijan and Armenia should rely on the Helsinki principles. She noted the need for the speedy completion of coordination of the key principles of the settlement.

Earlier on Sunday Clinton had a meeting with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev.
YEREVAN. July 5 (Interfax) - The United States wishes to improve relations with Russia and will continue cooperating with it, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said.
At a Sunday press conference in Yerevan she said that the United States clearly declared that it wishes to improve relations with Russia. On a number of questions, for example, sanctions against Iran, Afghanistan, the OSCE Minsk Group we cooperate, she said.
But that doesn't mean that there should be agreement on all issues, she added.
Clinton said that the United States will not agree with Moscow's stance on Georgia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
We believe that it is possible to reach a certain cooperation program without freezing relations, she said. The cooperation of Russia and the United States proceeds from the interests of the two countries and the rest of the world, she said.
She also said that Kyiv, for example, wishes to improve relations with both Russia and Europe. That is Kyiv's right, she said.
There is nothing unusual in Russia and the United States cooperating in the framework of the OSCE Minsk Group on Nagorno Karabakh but disagreeing on other issues, for instance, on Georgia, she said. That's normal, Clinton said.
The secretary of state also said that Russia and the United States will continue working and cooperating irrespective of everything.
DELHI. July 5 (Interfax) - Two Russian-made Indian submarines inflicted minor damage on each other by colliding in trying to moor at Mumbai alongside each other, officials said.
One of the two subs, which belong to a class termed "Kilo" by NATO, had moored successfully when the other tried to moor alongside but crashed into it moving at low speed, both vessels getting minor damage, a port spokesman told Interfax on Sunday.
A navy spokesman in New Delhi confirmed to Interfax that there had been a collision and said it took place 10 days before.
However, he said, no one was hurt and the damage was so insignificant that it hardly deserved mentioning.
He added that parallel mooring often resulted in collisions.
He said no onboard weapons or equipment had been damaged and that the subs would be repaired on the spot.
Indian Navy sources said one of the subs had just returned to India after an overhaul in Russia.
YEREVAN. July 5 (Interfax) - The settlement of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict must be based on the Helsinki principles, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said.
A fairly active process is under way in the framework of the OSCE Minsk Group, she said at a joint press conference with Armenian Foreign Minister Edvard Nalbandian. Both Armenia and Azerbaijan have the understanding that any settlement must be based on the Helsinki principles of nonuse of force, equality, the right of peoples to self-determination and territorial integrity.
Clinton also voiced hope that the sides would reach progress in agreeing on the fundamental principles of the settlement. In her opinion, this will facilitate a final agreement.
A return to violence is unacceptable, she said and added that the United States condemns violence and the latest border incident. She called the violation of the truce reached by the sides in 1994 unacceptable.
The secretary of state also said that the United States is ready to help Armenia and Azerbaijan settle the conflict. That is not easy but it is a guarantee for a peaceful and safe future, she said.
BAKU. July 5 (Interfax) - Countries chairing the OSCE Minsk Group have developed a common approach to the settlement of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict, U.S. cochairman of the group Robert Bradtke said on Sunday as reported by ANS TV channel.
There is a common approach to the issue and there is no difference between us, including difference of opinions, he said. Close cooperation has been established, he said.
Bradtke said that the arrival of the cochairman of the Minsk Group in Baku demonstrates the unification of the efforts of the United States, Russia and France on the matter.
French cochairman Bernard Fassier said that there was a meeting with the de facto government of Nagorno Karabakh and the defense minister of Armenia. "We had full format talks with the minister of foreign affairs and Armenian President Serzh Sargsian," he said.
The statement of the presidents of the cochairman countries in Canada was discussed in detail in Yerevan, he said.
He said the meeting in Azerbaijan was fruitful and fairly constructive compared to previous ones. "We will traditionally issue a statement at the end of the visit," he said.
According to the Russian cochairman Igor Popov, the foreign ministers and cochairmen must fulfill the instructions of their presidents in order to achieve a speedy settlement of the conflict.
"With the Armenian side we discussed the June 18 incident on the frontline. After the incident we immediately issued a joint statement denouncing the incident and noting the negative impact of such events on the progress of the peace process. The Armenian side reported information about the killed and wounded. As for the recovery of the body of the killed Azerbaijani serviceman, as far as I know the issue is being discussed by the relevant authorities and the body will be returned in due order," he said.
On Sunday the diplomats are to meet U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who is in Baku for an official visit. They will discuss the current situation at the Karabakh settlement talks.
The meetings of cochairman with Azerbaijani officials are scheduled for Monday.
