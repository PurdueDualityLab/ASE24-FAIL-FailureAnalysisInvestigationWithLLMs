Glitch Causes Ship to Miss International Space Station

MOSCOW - An unmanned Russian supply vessel docked Sunday without trouble at the International Space Station, two days after a technical glitch forced a similar maneuver to be aborted.
Space officials said they managed to avoid the radio signal problems that forced them to abandon last week's docking. The Progress M-06M cargo ship, launched on June 30, is carrying 2.6 tons of fuel, food and water for the three Russian and three U.S. astronauts on the station.
"At 20:17 pm Moscow time, the Progress M-06M docked at the Star module of the ISS," the Russian Mission Control Center said in an Internet statement.
An attempted docking on Friday was aborted when a radio link with the ISS was lost about 25 minutes before the planned rendezvous.
Sunday's successful docking was done automatically under the supervision of experts in Moscow and the ISS team, it said, without using the radio link.
Progress launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on June 30.
It is the 40th Russian cargo vessel to dock at the station, the centre said.
In contrast to the troubles that plagued the first rendezvous attempt, Sunday's second try "was executed flawlessly," the U.S. space agency NASA said on its web site.
The space ship's failure to dock last week after flying past the ISS was notable largely because it was a rare mishap in a space program which usually strives for and achieves pinpoint accuracy.
During the mishap "in the beginning everything was normal, then the automatic (docking) mode failed, and later the station's crew could not dock the vessel in manual mode," a Russian space center spokesman told the Itar-Tass news agency.
The automatic docking system also failed during the last Progress supply ship docking in May, though the process was successfully carried out manually.
The ISS, which orbits 350 kilometers above Earth, is a sophisticated platform for scientific experiments, helping test the effects of long-term space travel on humans, a must for any trip to distant Mars.
Progress is carrying 862 kilos of propellant, 50 kilos of oxygen, 100 kilos of water and 1,210 kilos of experimental equipment, spare parts and other supplies to the station.
The rendezvous occurred 350 kilometers above Earth as both the ISS and resupply ship flew over the point where the borders of China, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Russia intersect.
