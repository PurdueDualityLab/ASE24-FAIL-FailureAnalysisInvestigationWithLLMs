Section: General News - An unmanned Russian cargo ship docks successfully at the International Space Station on its second attempt after missing its scheduled docking last Friday due to a faulty radio link.
Two days after a docking mishap, an unmanned Russian cargo vessel made a successful second attempt to dock with the International Space Station on Sunday.
Progress missed its scheduled docking on Friday after it lost communication with the station, forcing NASA to abort the process.
The glitch between the two vehicles, caused by a faulty radio link, occurred about 25 minutes before the Progress ship was due to automatically park itself at a berthing slip on the station's Russian Zvezda module.
Instead, the ship, carrying 2.5 tonnes of cargo including fuel, food, water, equipment and spare parts for life-support gear, floated past the station at a safe distance of about 2 miles.
The ship is the 38th Progress vehicle sent to the orbiting space station, a 100 billion U.S. dollar project of 16 nations. - Thai ASEAN News Network
