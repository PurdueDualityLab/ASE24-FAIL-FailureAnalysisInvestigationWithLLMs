A FAULTY radio link forced an unmanned Russian cargo ship to abort its docking at the International Space Station, US and Russian space officials said. The glitch between the two vehicles occurred about 25 minutes before the Progress ship was due to automatically park itself at a berthing slip on the station's Russian Zvezda module. Instead, Progress floated past the station at a safe distance of about 3km, said Nasa spokesman Rob Navias, adding that the six- member Russian-American crew was never in any danger.
