NASA delays shuttle finale until 2011
CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (Reuters) - NASA on Thursday postponed the final two missions of the space shuttle program until November and February due to delays preparing the last load of spare parts for the International Space Station. Shuttle Discovery's launch on a cargo resupply mission will be postponed from September to November 1, under a plan approved by NASA managers.
Russian cargo vessel misses space station
MOSCOW (Reuters) - A faulty radio link forced an unmanned Russian cargo ship to abort its docking at the International Space Station on Friday, U.S. and Russian space officials said. The glitch between the two vehicles occurred about 25 minutes before the Progress ship was due to automatically park itself at a berthing slip on the station's Russian Zvezda module.
Gene pattern predicts who will live the longest
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Researchers have found a pattern of genes that predicts with more accuracy than ever before who might live to be 100 or older -- even if they have other genes linked with disease. Their findings, published in Friday's issue of the journal Science, offer the tantalizing possibility of predicting who might hope for a longer life. They also cast doubt on the accuracy of tests being marketed now that offer to predict a person's risk of chronic diseases such as Alzheimer's.
Fossil of mega-toothed killer whale found in Peru
LIMA (Reuters) - The fossil of a giant whale called Leviathan for having teeth bigger than a grown man's forearms has been found in Peru by paleontologists who on Thursday said it may have been the largest predator to ever roam the seas. Leviathan Melvillei, which was named after the sea monster in the Bible and the author of "Moby Dick" Herman Melville, is an ancestor of the modern day sperm whale, said Rodolfo Salas, a paleontologist at Peru's Natural History Museum who took part in the study.
Frozen blood a source of stem cells, study finds
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Frozen blood from stored samples can be used to make cells resembling stem cells, researchers said on Thursday -- opening a potential new and easier source for the valued cells. They used cells from blood to make induced pluripotent stem cells or iPS cells -- lab-made cells that closely resemble human embryonic stem cells but are made from ordinary tissue.
Rogue cells explain Parkinson's transplant problem: study
LONDON (Reuters) - Scientists working with Parkinson's disease patients who had pioneering transplant surgery using aborted foetal tissue have figured out what causes one of the most damaging side-effects of the treatment. The finding opens the way for a revival of the controversial and unpredictable procedure, which was halted in the mid-1990s after many patients suffered bouts of serious sudden and uncontrolled movements.
