A faulty radio link forced an unmanned Russian cargo ship to abort its docking at the International Space Station on Friday, U.S. and Russian space officials said.
The glitch between the two vehicles occurred about 25 minutes before the Progress ship was due to automatically park itself at a berthing slip on the station's Russian Zvezda module.
Instead, Progress floated past the station at a safe distance of about three kilometres, said NASA spokesman Rob Navias, adding that the six-member Russian-American crew was never in any danger.
Interfax quoted the station's commander, cosmonaut Alexander Skvortsov, as telling Russian mission control that the Progress was "spinning uncontrollably" before disappearing from view.
But Russian space agency deputy head Vitaly Davydov later said the ship was not out of control.
"The Progress ship and the International Space Station are in working order and reliable communication with them is being maintained," Davydov said.
The Progress M-06M blasted off on Wednesday from Kazakhstan, packed with 2.5 tonnes of cargo including fuel, food, water, equipment and spare parts for life-support gear.
No additional docking attempts will be made for at least two days.
