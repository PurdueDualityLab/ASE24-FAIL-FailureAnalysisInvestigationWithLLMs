ZHUKOVSKY, Moscow region. July 2 (Interfax-AVN) - Arms and military hardware will be supplied to the national subdivisions of the Collective Security Treaty Organization's Collective Rapid Reaction Force (CSTO KSOR) at concessional prices, First Deputy Director of the Federal Service for Military Technical Cooperation (FSMTC) Alexander Fomin told Interfax-AVN.
"All bilateral and multilateral supplies will be made at the CSTO prices. This mechanism has already been tested," said Fomin, commenting on the results of an international conference, which focused on the supply of modern and compatible weapons to the CSTO KSOR.
The most advanced models of weapons and military hardware made in the CSTO countries will enter service in the KSOR upon mutual approval by the member states, he said. "The task is to take the best what can be offered by Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and other CSTO countries. The most important thing is to unify, harmonize and make compatible all types of weapons," Fomin said.
To be able to contain conflicts in any particular member state, the KSOR must be equipped with special weapons and hardware, including non-lethal weapons, he said. "It is important to promptly react to the epicenters of such threats to prevent them from getting more dangerous and widespread," Fomin said.
The recent events in southern Kyrgyzstan are an example of such threats, he said.
MOSCOW. July 2 (Interfax) - Russian state nuclear materials exporter Techsnabexport (Tenex) expects to boost its export order book more than 50% to $30 billion by 2020, the company said in its annual report.
By then, Tenex plans to be meeting at least a quarter of the needs of the world's nuclear reactors for uranium enrichment services, and to double its presence in the Asia-Pacific market.
Efforts to improve the trade environment for Russian uranium in the key markets need to be sustained for this to be achieved, Tenex said.
The export contracts portfolio for five years in advance exceeded $8 billion in 2009, not including shipments under the megatons-to- megawatts deal, by which Russia ships highly enriched uranium (HEU) removed from dismantled nuclear warheads to the United States in diluted form suitable for nuclear power pant fuel. The overall portfolio of long-term contracts, including for delivery after 2010, was estimated at $18 billion.
Tenex ships nuclear materials via the [port of St Petersburg, among others. It mostly uses the Northern Shipping Company (RTS: SEMP) and Atlantic Ro-Ro Carriers to ship materials to Europe and the United States.
The company's logistics partners are Transport Logistics International (U.S.), Nuclear Cargo+Service (Germany), TN Internationale (France) and Uranium Asset Management (UK).
Tuenex said its turnover could rise 11.6% this year to $3.85 billion from $3.45 billion. Europe accounted for $1.5 billion of turnover in 2009, North America - $1 billion and Asia (China, Japan and South Korea) - $500 million.
Tenex's share of the world market is an estimated 40%.
Tenex said uranium-related sales revenue rose 81.5% in 2009 to 76.346 billion rubles, after it switched to a purely contractual basis for delivery. The company received 30% of its revenue in the form of commission in 2008. Exchange-rate factors also influenced revenue.
At the same time, commercial uranium exports fell 8.8% last year to $2.011 billion because these had jumped the year before, due mainly to a supplementary shipment of materials to U.S. firm Palmco ($116 million in 2008) following an arbitration court ruling.
Shipments under the megatons-megawatts deal grew 8.3% to $886 million in 2009 as the cost of services to dilute the HEU rose. All proceeds from this contract go into the Russian budget.
Net profit rose 150% last year to 14.5 billion rubles and consolidated income grew 90% to 80.3 billion rubles.
Tenex expects quotas to re-export the Russian low-enriched uranium (LEU) via the U.S. to be eased. An anti-dumping duty used to prevent Tenex from signing direct LEU supply contracts with U.S. power companies, and an agreement was reached in 2008 to enable Tenex to raise direct shipments gradually, to 20%.
But the re-export restriction, imposed in the early 1990s, remains in place, and talks to relax this quota are under way, Rosatom told Interfax.
Tenex said also that Russian shipments had been subject to stealth quotas in Europe, but that permanent dialog with EU energy and Euratom had eased this problem for a while.
Tenex could take up more than half the quota it has agreed to for direct LEU shipments to the United States by 2020 by the end of this year or early next year, the company's chief, Alexei Grigoryev, has told Interfax. Grigoryev has said Tenex had signed $4.3 billion worth of long-term uranium contracts with U.S. companies to date.
Approximately half of all U.S. reactors work on Russian LEU, derived from weapons-grade uranium.
Tenex also said in the annual report that U.S. firm ConverDyn agreed to open U308 and uranium hexafluoride material resource accounts for the Russian company's Frankfurt-based Internexco subsidiary in 2009. Internexco, established in 1989, saw record sales revenue and net profit of EUR 375.2 million and EUR 6.7 million, respectively, last year.
Internexco signed a new long-term contract with a European customer to 2020.
Tenex registered the London-based subsidiary Tradewill Limited in June 2009 to promote nuclear goods and services under the Tenex brand and exported by other Rosatom organizations in the world market.
ZHUKOVSKY, Moscow region. July 5 (Interfax) - The Russian budget has not allocated funds for acquisition of Israeli drones and French Mistral ships for the Russian Armed Forces, Alexander Yemelyanov, head of Rosoboronexport's delegation at the Technologies In Mechanical Engineering forum, told journalists on Thursday.
"For us to be able to acquire [foreign weapons] for the Russian army, such acquisition has to be stipulated in a government defense order. The decision is made by the president, not the defense ministry. There must be a line in the government defense order," Yemelyanov said.
"So far there are neither such lines, nor decisions," he said.
ASTANA/MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax) - Russia and Kazakhstan will sign an agreement on marketing policy in the nuclear sector two months from now, Russia's Rosatom corporation said.
The understanding was reached in Astana on Monday, where Rosatom and Kazakh national nuclear corporation Kazatomprom signed documents, including an agreement to alter then format for cooperation under the auspices of the Uranium Enrichment Center joint venture. Now, instead of building new enrichment capacity, Kazakhstan will receive a stake in an existing Russian enrichment plant, namely the Urals Electrochemicals Combine in Novouralsk.
They also agreed to draft a joint sales and marketing policy for the joint venture and to sign a separate agreement to cover that.
Russia and Kazakhstan also signed a memorandum on integration and the development of cooperation, in which they affirm their commitment to forming a consolidated nuclear industry company on an equal basis.
The first step towards forming this company will be the joint sale of natural and low-enriched uranium, and other products and services for Russian-Kazakh joint ventures.
"This is a comprehensive agreement. The first is on joint participation in the enrichment plant. It's what we agreed on long ago, and the implementation of previously approved plans for global integration. We agreed we would not build a new plant because this would take too long. It would be more comfortable for the Kazakh partners to participate in an existing Russian plant, which will be our biggest one in Novouralsk, where we'll transfer some shares to Kazatomprom," Rosatom chief Sergei Kiriyenko told reporters.
The Rosatom and Kazatomprom chiefs also briefed the presidents of the two countries on preparations to build a first VVER-300 reactor in Kazakhstan under the auspices of a joint venture.
Kiriyenko said Kazakhstan had not yet decided where the new nuclear power plant would be located.
"These are all further steps towards accomplishing the mission that our presidents gave us a few years ago to integrate the Russian and Kazkah nuclear industries. We're even doing what we agreed a little ahead of schedule," Kiriyenko said.
The first products of nuclear cooperation between Russia and Kazakhstan were the formation of uranium mining joint ventures. Russia's Atomredmetzoloto (ARMZ) is handing its stakes in these joint ventures to Canada's Uranium One in exchange for control over this company.
Plans emerged in 2008 to create a consolidated nuclear company, however talks were protracted, partly due to Kazakhstan's position, a Rosatom source has said, and Russia had also lost interest in this project.
MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax) - Kyrgyzstan reported the largest industrial production growth in the CIS in January-May 2010 (56.8%), the CIS Interstate Statistic Committee said.
The committee explained the year-to-year growth with the resumed operation of the Kumtor gold mine operating at full capacity.
Tajikistan reported industrial production growth of 14.5%; the growth stood at 12.6% in Ukraine; 12.1% in Armenia and 11.9% in Kazakhstan.
Russian industrial production grew by 10.3% in January-May 2010. The growth reached 7.7% in Belarus, 6.1% in Moldova and 4.3% in Azerbaijan.
The committee has no information about industrial production in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in the aforesaid period. The growth stood at 7% in Uzbekistan in the first quarter of the year.
Ukraine had the largest inflation in the CIS, 10.3%. Year-to-year inflation reached 7.6% in Armenia, 7.2% in Kazakhstan, 6.7% in Russia and in Moldova, 6.5% in Belarus, 5.4% in Tajikistan, 4.7% in Azerbaijan and 2.8% in Kyrgyzstan.
The overall industrial production in the CIS grew by 11% in January-May. Cargo traffic enlarged by 6%, retail trade increased by 4% and investments in fixed assets went down by 2%.
Consumer prices in the CIS grew by 7% year-to-year.
ASTANA. July 5 (Interfax) - The single economic space should start working on January 1, 2012, Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov said.
"The full single economic space package should start working no later than January 1, 2012," Shuvalov told a briefing after the EurAsEC summit.
On Monday, the presidents decided that "the governments of the three countries need to take all measures and work very actively to ensure that all agreements forming the single economic space are ready by January 1, 2011," Shuvalov said.
Shuvalov recalled that it was initially agreed to prepare only the first of the 14 agreements by this date.
"However, it has been decided to speed up work and we need to do everything to develop and adopt the entire package by January 1, 2011," Shuvalov said.
ASTANA. July 5 (Interfax) - Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said he is hoping the work of the customs union will lead to the creation of a common market and a single currency market.
"We have now reached a very high level of integration. There is a Customs Union and it has started working. I believe the single economic space will lead to the creation of a common market, which will eventually lead to the creation of a joint currency space, which you have called for more than once and which the Russia Federation has always supported," Medvedev said during a meeting with his Kazakh counterpart Nursultan Nazarbayev in Astana on Monday.
ZHUKOVSKY. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - Russian defense enterprises are interested in selling and buying modern technologies that are essential for the creation of competitive samples of weapons and military equipment.
"One of the reasons why we are holding this forum is to draw companies to offer interesting technologies that we would buy," Konstantin Biryullin, deputy director of the Federal Service on Military-Technical Cooperation (FSVTS), told Interfax-AVN at the international forum Technologies in Machine-Building 2010 held in Zhukovsky, Moscow region.
Biryullin said it is a very important issue because the export component depends on the level of technologies used in the development and production of military equipment.
MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax) - Russia wishes economic integration with Ukraine in many sectors, including atomic machine building, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said at a meeting of the government presidium.
"We are ready to use the capacities of Ukrainian machine building plants in fulfilling nuclear power plant construction and modernization projects in our countries and in third states," he said.
"Russia is also interested in repairing and building ships together with Ukrainian shipyards," he said.
Russia and Ukraine are negotiating the formation of a joint venture of the United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) and the Antonov Corporation to promote Antonov aircraft in third countries, Putin said. Russia and Ukraine "will cooperate not only in traditional industries but also in innovative projects," he said.
For instance, they are forming a joint GLONASS navigation satellite space project, and a relevant agreement is already signed, Putin said.
Russia and Ukraine has formed a large portfolio of joint projects within several months, he said. "It is primarily the question of industries, in which cooperation of Russia and Ukraine will bring substantial competitive advantages, such as aircraft and ship building, energy and transport. We have certain advantages in those areas but there are many unresolved problems, as well," Putin said.
SERGEYEVSKY RANGE, Primorye territory. July 7 (Interfax-AVN) - The Vostok (East) 2010 strategic exercises, which are currently under way in Siberia and the Far East, should help adjust the Russian government's new weapons procurement program for 2011-2020, said Viktor Ozerov, chairman of the Defense Committee of the upper chamber of Russia's parliament.
"The Vostok 2010 operative strategic exercises have shown us in practice how the new personnel organization structure in the Russian Federation is functioning, and it has also shown us the possibilities, abilities and shortcomings of the state's new military organization," Ozerov told journalists on Wednesday.
Commenting on the continuing army reform, the senator said that "one of its key tasks is to provide the army with advanced weapons and military hardware."
"The first stage of the army reform - the creation of 100% standby military units, as well as the first steps to equip them with new state-of-the-art weapons and military hardware - has already been completed. Now we need to make sure that this new structure functions effectively," he said.
"I think that the government should see clearly how much money it needs to spend on the implementation of this program in 2011, as well as what adjustments should be made to the period of 2012-2013," Ozerov said.
VLADIVOSTOK. July 5 (Interfax) - The ability of fighters to make nonstop flights from the European part of Russia to the Far Eastern military district were checked for the first time during the Vostok-2010 exercise, chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Gen. Nikolai Makarov has reported to President Dmitry Medvedev.
The president asked how many times the fighters were refueled in the air. Makarov said that Sukhoi Su-24M aircraft were refueled three times and Su-34 aircraft two times.
At a conference reviewing the preliminary results of the exercise aboard the heavy nuclear-powered cruiser Pyotr Veliky Makarov said that strikes at orders received during the flight were drilled.
What makes the current exercise special is that it is conducted very dynamically at 18 testing ranges of two military districts and the Pacific Fleet, he added.
"The Vostok-2010 exercise is the biggest event in the training of troops this year," Makarov said.
He said that in the framework of the exercise three special drills were conducted in routing militant groups at three firing ranges. He also said there was a drill in repelling massive rocket and air strikes with range practice of three air defense brigades in Chita region.
The troops and forces of the Pacific Fleet also conducted an exercise in the Sea of Japan that for the first time in the Far East involved striking critical targets in Primorye, Makarov said.
DELHI. July 5 (Interfax) - India will modernize 50 Sukhoi Su-30 MKI fighters with help from the Russian United Aircraft Corporation within the next three to four years, an Indian Defense Ministry spokesman said ion Sunday.
The project is part of a program to modernize the aircraft fleet of the country's air force, the spokesman told Interfax.
Around five of the 50 jets would be modernized at the facilities of Russian aircraft manufacturer Irkut (RTS: IRKT). The others would be modernized at Indian facilities, the spokesman said.
ALICANTE, Spain. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - Russian helicopter builders will supply a Mistral ship with Kamov Ka-27M, Ka-52 and Ka-226 helicopters if the Defense Ministry approves the ship's purchase, First Deputy Managing Director of the Kumertau Aviation Plant Vyacheslav Kovalyov told Interfax-AVN on Monday.
"The state armaments program stipulates the purchase of a dozen helicopters for the ship. That would be Kamov Ka-27M, Ka-52 and Ka-226," he said.
A Mistral visited St. Petersburg last year, and Kamov Ka-27 and Ka-52 made a test landing on the ship, he said.
The plant has almost designed the Ka-27M, which will perform search and rescue missions, Kovalyov said. "The Defense Ministry has a keen interest in the Ka-52 bearing in mind the possible acquisition of the Mistral," he said.
Meanwhile, a defense industry source told Interfax-AVN that the Defense Ministry planned to order up to 100 helicopters for new helicopter ships.
ALICANTE, Spain. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - The Russian Emergency Situations Ministry will soon buy an additional batch of Kamov Ka-32 helicopters.
"The Emergency Situations Ministry has a number of Ka-32 helicopters, which are being used actively and modernized. Additional purchases are planned. A contract on the delivery of five Ka-32 helicopters is being prepared for signing," First Deputy Managing Director of the Kumertau Aviation Plant Vyacheslav Kovalyov said.
The delivery is due this or next year. "The Emergency Situations Ministry will keep buying the helicopters but Ka-32 exports are even more intensive," he said.
The Emergency Situations Ministry used the Ka-32 horizontal fire fighting system for the first time on June 30, 2010, for putting out a blaze at the Moscow Radio Instrument Research institute. "The Ka-32 put out the fire with the help of the horizontal water gun," Kovalyov said.
ALICANTE, Spain. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - Many countries are interested in buying Russia's Kamov Ka-32A11VS helicopters for putting out forest and city fires, First Deputy Managing Director of the Kumertau Aviation Plant Vyacheslav Kovalyov told Interfax-AVN.
"Thirteen Ka-32 have been supplied to Spain since 2004, and they want to order one or two helicopters next year. As a rule, the orders are made before the wildfire season. We were unable to fulfill the orders earlier because of the long production cycle. Now we produce helicopters in advance and can meet the demand," he said.
Apart from Spain, the Ka-32A11VS are sold to Portugal, South Korea, Vietnam, Malaysia, Laos, Canada, Algeria and Iran. "South Korea is the No 1 client. It has about 70 [Ka-32A11VS]. We have dispatched another helicopter [to South Korea] and have orders for three more," he said.
Canada is mostly using the Ka-32A11VS for carrying precious timber. "Algeria and Iran have one helicopter each. Negotiations are under way with Arab countries," Kovalyov said.
Experts proclaim that the Ka-32A11VS is the best fire-fighting helicopter. It displays unique characteristics in putting out fires, especially in mountainous areas or on the upper stories of high-rises in densely populated city districts.
ZHUKOVSKY, Moscow region. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - A Russian-Ukrainian joint venture will draft proposals on the integration of the United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) and the Antonov Corporation and will promote Antonov aircraft on the market.
"The joint venture with Ukraine is due to be formed by October 1. We have agreed to set up the joint venture of the UAC and Antonov rather than establish a new company," UAC President Alexei Fyodorov said at the Machine Building Technologies 2010 forum in Zhukovsky.
Ukraine will buy 50% in UAC Civil Aircraft for 12.5 million rubles. The company's charter capital will amount to 25 million rubles.
The joint venture will fulfill Antonov projects, among them An-140, An-148, An-124 and, possibly, An-70, Fyodorov said.
"The joint venture will concentrate on the drafting of proposals on the integration of the UAC and Antonov so that a single company could be formed in the future," he said.
In addition, the joint venture "will do the marketing, sell and provide maintenance [to Antonov aircraft] and ensure cooperation with partners," he added.
ZHUKOVSKY, Moscow region. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - Integration of the Russia-India BrahMos supersonic missile with the Sukhoi Su-30MKI multi-role fighter jet may start in the near future, Machine Building Research and Production Center leading designer Igor Kharlamov told Interfax-AVN on Friday, at the Machine Building Technologies 2010 forum in Zhukovsky.
"A contract on the BrahMos integration with the Su-30MKI is being drafted. It will be presented to Indian partners soon," he said.
The draft contract enumerates prospective works and estimates their cost, as well as the deadline for testing BrahMos missiles within the Su-30MKI system.
"The Indian Air Force will assign two jets for the testing and develop the missile launcher for integrating the missile into the plane system. All types of land and flight tests will be done, and a report will be drafted on the system worthiness," he said.
The works may take 30 months. The works will start as soon as the contract is signed and the funding begins.
ZHUKOVSKY, Moscow region. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - Russian Helicopters Holding will open about 30 service centers abroad in the next decade, its First Deputy General Director Igor Pshenichny said at the Machine Building Technologies 2010 forum in Zhukovsky on Friday.
"The Helicopter Service Company formed by the holding is building a multi-level service network for Russian-made helicopters," he said.
Service is an important element of the holding development strategy, Pshenichny said. He noted that the holding aspired for controlling 15% of the world helicopter market by 2020. Today the holding produces 7-8% of all helicopters in the world.
"The world is using about 7,000 helicopters. We must not forget about that," he said.
There are four Russian helicopter service centers based in India, China, Vietnam and the United Arab Emirates and one helicopter repair plant in Latin America. The holding will open five service centers and a regional logistic center in Latin America, seven service centers and one regional center in Asia, three centers in Africa and two in Europe by 2015, he said.
MOSCOW. July 8 (Interfax-AVN) - Scientists from Russia's Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI) have developed a new concept for a perspective long-haul aircraft with moderate passenger capacity, based on the 'flying wing' aerodynamic scheme, the Institute said in a press release.
"This scheme brings together the functions of a wing, empennage and fuselage, passengers are placed in the wide center-section of the wing," TsAGI said in the press statement, a copy of which was obtained by Interfax-AVN on Wednesday.
Apart from TsAGI, largest western aircraft makers Airbus and Boeing are also studying the possibility of applying the 'flying wing' scheme for passenger airplanes, the press statement said.
"The main studies focused on the prospect for creating transport aircraft with superhigh capacity (700-1000 passengers). At smaller sizes, it is hard to 'fit' the passenger compartment into the useful dimensions of the 'flying wing.' TsAGI specialists have managed to resolve this problem and to work out a new concept for a long-haul airplane with moderate capacity," the statement said.
As a result of theoretical studies and experiments conducted in aerodynamic pipes it has been proved that decreasing the aircraft capacity to 150-200 passenger does not deprive the 'flying wing' of its aerodynamic advantages.
With its reduced aerodynamic resistance, structure weight and fuel consumption, the 'flying wing' has a 20% higher aerodynamic quality. Using the TsAGI concept in creating aircraft of the post-Boeing 787 generation will ensure a 15% fuel consumption saving and a radical noise reduction to 30 EPN decibels by 2025.
ZHUKOVSKY, Moscow region. July 8 (Interfax-AVN) - The United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) estimates the demand for Russia's new medium-range MS-21 aircraft at over 1,000 units, UAC President Alexei Fyodorov told Interfax at the Machine Building Technologies 2010 forum in Zhukovsky.
"We hope to sell 1,000-1,200 planes," he said.
About two-thirds of the planes will be exported, Fyodorov noted.
The MS-21 program is on schedule, he said. "We are now planning the project details. First, we will make a preliminary design, and the engineering design will be done next," he said.
"The UAC business plan is being constantly updated. We have not made any serious amendments so far," Fyodorov said.
He said that the MS-21 will not compete with the Sukhoi Superjet-100.
"These aircraft are meant for different markets," he noted.
MOSCOW. July 8 (Interfax-AVN) - The Indian Saras light transport aircraft will be upgraded at the Myasishchev Experimental Machine Building Plant in Moscow, a defense industry source told Interfax-AVN.
"A framework contract was signed last September to upgrade and certify the Saras plane and to develop plane modifications in 2010-2011," he said.
India built two Saras planes and one of them crashed during a test flight. The second plane will be modernized with Russian help, he said.
"Saras test flights will start at the end of this year or at the beginning of next year," he said.
MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - Planned docking on Friday between a Russian supply spacecraft and the International Space Station was aborted as the space freighter missed the ISS and started rotating uncontrollably, the Russian mission control told Interfax-AVN.
The Progress M-06M "is moving away from us and running ahead toward the [Zvezda service module]," ISS commander Alexander Skvortsov told the mission control. He said he could see the Progress "rotating uncontrollably." "I can't see the freighter, it's gone ahead," he said.
A mission control spokesman told Interfax-AVN docking might be put off. He did not say what had gone wrong with the Progress.
MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - The docking of the Progress M-06M cargo spacecraft to the International Space Station has been postponed by almost 24 hours, the Mission Control Center (MCC) told Interfax on Friday.
"Most likely, the docking will be postponed by 24 hours," an MCC official said.
The docking initially scheduled for today was going smoothly when a failure caused the ship to pass by the station, he said.
Efforts to correct the situation have failed even after switching to the so-called teleoperator control mode, that is a manual mode operated by astronauts themselves.
MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax-AV) - A commission will be set up to investigate the breakdown and failed docking of the Progress-M-06M cargo spacecraft to the International Space Station.
"Due to the incident, a commission will be formed consisting of specialists from the Rocket Space Corporation Energia and representatives from the Central Research Institute of Machine-Building, which includes the Mission Control Center," a Corporation Energia official told Interfax-AVN.
The commission will attempt to investigate the incident within the shortest period of time, the company official said.
On Friday the Progress M-06M ship passed by the station due to an automatics failure. The astronauts failed to take control over the spacecraft and to perform the manual docking.
This is a second consecutive non-standard docking of a Progress series ship to the ISS. On May 1 the cargo ship had to be docked to the ISS manually.
MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - Russia's space mission control tentatively set a second attempt to dock the International Space Station with Russian supply spacecraft Progress M-06M for Sunday after the first attempt on Friday ended in failure, with the Progress missing the ISS, Vitaly Davydov, deputy head of the Federal Space Agency, said at the mission control.
A mission control spokesman told Interfax-AVN, however, that the docking attempt might be put off until Monday.
He said the source of the trouble was the Kurs automated docking system, which had also run into problems when the previous supply craft was trying to dock with the station in May.
Earlier on Friday, a mission control official told the ISS crew: "At this point, please have your dinner. Docking has been canceled. Nor is any work being done on the Progress. But please stay in contact."
A mission control spokesman told Interfax-AVN the Progress had passed the station at "a safe distance" of about 3 kilometers.
"The crew of the station was unable to take over control of the spacecraft when it became clear that the automated system was out of order," he said.
ISS commander Alexander Skvortsov said he could see the Progress "rotating uncontrollably."
KOROLYOV, Moscow Region. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - The cause of Friday's abortive operation to dock Russian supply spacecraft Progress M-06M with the International Space Station was a radio contact glitch in one of the docking systems, a deputy head of the Federal Space Agency said after a successful second docking attempt on Sunday.
However, the Progress' new digital control system had not been the source of the trouble, agency deputy chief Vitaly Davydov told reporters at the mission control outside Moscow.
"A commission is working on the cause of the unstable contact. We will definitely get to the source of the unstable contact within the next two weeks," said the president of the Energia rocket and space corporation, Vitaly Lopota.
MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - A Russian supply spacecraft docked with the International Space Station on Sunday after an unsuccessful docking operation on Friday in which it missed the ISS, a spokesman for the Russian mission control said.
Sunday's docking operation was carried through by an automated, the spokesman told Interfax-AVN.
On Friday, the Kurs automated docking system went out of order when the Progress was between 2 and 3 kilometers from the ISS, and an attempt by the station crew to use the manual docking control system was also unsuccessful. The supply craft missed the station and moved away from it.
MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - The S-500 missile-based air defense system currently being developed in Russia will be able to destroy any targets, including those being developed by Russia's potential foes, Maj. Gen. Sergei Popov, the commander of the Russian Air Force's Missile Anti-Aircraft Forces, said on Echo Moskvy radio on Saturday.
"The S-500, a new system being developed now, makes another step that is ahead of our potential enemy's by at least 15-20 years," Popov said.
"Those modern aircraft possessed or being developed by our potential opponents do not pose a great problem even to more or less trained anti-aircraft units," he said.
Igor Asurbeili, the general director of the Almaz-Antei air defense design bureau, had said earlier that the development of the S-500 system should be finished by 2015.
MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - Pantsir-S close-range anti-aircraft gun and missile system is being supplied to Russia's air defense units, Air Force Anti-Aircraft Missile Force Commander Maj. Gen. Sergei Popov said.
"The system took part in the VE-Day parade in Moscow on May 9, 2010. The system has proven its worth, and we are using it in all exercises," he said in a live program of the Ekho Moskvy radio on Saturday.
"In my opinion, the Pantsir-S is a rather good system which is bound to replace the old S-125. The Pantsir-S carries twelve rockets and 14,000 projectiles and three target tracing channels and can fire while in motion," Popov said.
Air defense units are armed with S-300 of various modifications, S-400 'Triumf' and a small number of Buk-M1.
The close-range Pantsir-S is a product of the Tula Instrument Design Bureau. It is a unique system capable of destroying all types of modern and prospective aerial targets, primarily high precision armaments at a range of up to 20 kilometers and an altitude of up to 15 kilometers. The missile speed is 1,300 meters per second.
The system can be used against land- and sea-based lightly-armored targets and personnel. It is capable of firing from stationary positions and in motion, as well as during brief stops.
ASTANA. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - Kazakhstan Garysh Sapary, a component of the Kazakh Space Agency, will build a telecom satellite for CIS Central Asian states by 2018, Company President Gabdullatif Myrzakulov said.
"We will start building a regional telecom satellite for CIS member countries in 2018. This project will ensure effective use of orbit frequency resources of Central Asian states," he told Interfax.
"We will coordinate the idea with regional neighbors" within six to seven years, he added.
The Kazakh satellite assembly and testing center may cost 131 million euros, Myrzakulov said.
"EADS Astrium will bear almost a third of the expenditures," he added.
MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - There will be no replacement for the Coronas Photon solar research satellite, which malfunctioned last year and was removed from the Russian orbiting cluster on Wednesday, for another five years, an aerospace sector representative told Interfax-AVN.
"We are fulfilling a federal space program for the period until 2015. No one is going to amend that program, because there will be no funds for new projects. The available funds for the Coronas Photon project will not be enough for building a new space vehicle," he said.
Coronas Photon was put into orbit on January 30, 2009, and sprang into life on February 26, 2009. The first month in orbit yielded about 10,000 solar images in both the X-ray and ultraviolet range.
The vehicle's batteries went flat in late November 2009 because they had not been recharged for a long time. Scientific instruments stopped functioning and contact with the spacecraft was lost.
ASTANA. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - Kazakhstan will build a satellite assembly and testing center in Astana in 2012 to produce all types of satellites for local and foreign clients together with France's EADS Astrium, Kazakhstan Garysh Sapary President Gabdullatif Myrzakulov told Interfax.
The company is a component of the Kazakh Space Agency.
"The prospective center will enable Kazakhstan to assemble all types of satellites, such as optical, radar and telecommunications. I would not call it a 'screwdriver' factory," he said.
"True, main parts will be manufactured in France, although we may have some other suppliers whose products have proven their value. We will be assembling and testing satellites," he noted.
Kazakhstan's contribution to the work will grow eventually, from 10% in 2014 to 40% in 2020, mostly with software, Myrzakulov said.
The center will be producing three satellites in two years at first, and will reach its full capacity by 2015, he noted. Final production parameters of the center are yet unknown.
The agreement on building the satellite assembly and testing center was signed during a Kazakh visit of French President Nicolas Sarkozy on October 6, 2009.
He told Interfax later that EADS Astrium would build the Astana center by the end of 2012. EADS Astrium will have 27.5% in the joint venture, and the rest will belong to Kazakhstan.
MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - Russia is hoping to send the Venera-D probe to the planet within the next decade to replicate the success of Soviet automated interplanetary probes, Director of the Russian Academy of Sciences' Space Research Institute Academician Lev Zelyony told Interfax-AVN.
"Venera-D is one of our future projects. It will be interesting from the scientific and technological points of view. We wish to reproduce the success of the 1970s. Venera-D will soon enter the designer stage," he said.
The interplanetary mission plan is still unclear, the academician said. "Institute staff have diverse opinions. Our French partners will take part in the project, but they have no common opinion either. However, the Russian space program for the period until 2020 will certainly include this project, and we hope it will be successful," he aid.
Venera-D will study Venus's atmosphere and surface and reasons why there is no water on the planet. The letter D signifies the long duration of the mission, i.e. comprehensive atmospheric studies. Bearing in mind the aggressiveness of Venus's atmosphere (high pressure and temperatures), the landing vehicle may be operational for several days or even hours.
The probe will be made up of the orbiter, the landing vehicle and two tanks. The orbiter will collect atmospheric data and transfer it back to Earth.
MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - Representatives of the Eutelsat European satellite telecom operator have visited Reshetnev Information Satellite Systems in Zheleznogorsk, Krasnoyarsk territory, to discuss the current status and further operation of the Sesat satellite that has been in orbit for ten years.
"The Eutelsat representatives said that professionalism and high skills of the Reshetnev personnel had enabled the smooth operation of the satellite through the entire period of its service life. The satellite continued to work for the client," says a Reshetnev report received by Interfax-AVN.
Sesat incorporates the best domestic and western technologies and various satellite philosophies, Reshetnev General Designer and Director Nikolai Testoyedov said.
"The successful project not only started fruitful international cooperation of Russian and European companies but also determined the path of further mutually beneficial contacts," he said.
Sesat was put into orbit on April 18, 2000. It re-transmits telephone, digital TV and Internet signals in Europe, the Near East, Eastern and Central Siberia.
BAIKONUR. July 7 (Interfax-AVN) - Four Russian carrier rockets will be launched from Baikonur, Kazakhstan, in the coming three months, a source at the cosmodrome told Interfax-AVN.
"There will be one launch each in July and August, and two in September," the source said.
A heavy-class Proton-M with a Briz-M upper stage is to blast off at 10:40 p.m., Moscow time, on July 10. It will carry the 5.5 tonne American telecommunications satellite EchoStar 15 to a geo-transitional orbit.
A Proton-M with Briz-M will be launched on August 17 to put the American-Canadian telecommunications satellite SkyTerra 1 (formerly called MSV 1) into a geo-transitional orbit.
September 2 will see the launch of a Proton-M with a DM-2 upper stage and three Glonass-M satellites for the Russian global satellite navigation system GLONASS. "The launch was previously scheduled for late August," the source said.
A medium-class Soyuz-U carrier rocket will send the Russian freighter Progress M-07M, the fourth one in 2010, to the International Space Station. "The launch will be carried out from a reserve launch site at Launch Pad 31," according to the source.
Baikonur is the world's first cosmodrome, which Russia is renting until 2050. As many as 1,336 carrier rockets have been launched from Baikonur, with 13 launched so far in 2010.
MOSCOW. July 8 (Interfax-AVN) - The European Space Agency (ESA) is holding talks with the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos) on the acquisition of additional places for European astronauts on Russian Soyuz spacecraft that take crews to the International Space Station (ISS).
"It is true that such talks are under way," head of the ESA permanent mission in Russia Rene Pischel told Interfax Wednesday.
However, he could not say when the talks would end or when such flights to the ISS may take place.
Earlier ESA Director of Human Spaceflight Simonetta di Pippo told the foreign media that the agency was discussing a deal with Roscosmos on additional short space flights of European astronauts to ISS starting with 2013-2016.
Head of the Roscosmos human missions Alexei Krasnov said that Roscosmos hopes to finance the expansion of the production of Soyuz spacecraft from four to five a year.
He said ESA would wish to increase the presence of its astronauts on ISS and the Russian-made Soyuz spaceship is the only vehicle for them. This means the fifth spacecraft could be used for such flights.
BAIKONUR. July 8 (Interfax-AVN) - The Proton-M launch vehicle with the U.S. EchoStar15 communication satellite was installed on the launch ramp of pad #200 of Baikonur cosmodrome on Wednesday morning, an Interfax correspondent reports.
The transportation of the space rocket from the assembly tower began at 4:30 a.m. Moscow time and at 8 a.m. it was placed in vertical position, a source at the cosmodrome told Interfax.
The takeoff of the space rocket with Briz-M upper stage and EchoStar15 satellite is scheduled for 10:40 p.m. Moscow time on July 10.
MOSCOW. July 8 (Interfax-AVN) - The Start Research and Production Center has developed a vertical launcher for Shtil ship-based anti-aircraft guided missiles, Start Assistant General Director for Investments and Marketing Alexander Motovilov told Interfax-AVN.
"We expect the Defense Ministry to organize state tests of the launcher," he said.
The launcher will be suitable for exports, Motovilov said.
"The navy had been using a launcher for firing one Shtil missile. The new launcher is capable of firing several missiles," he said.
The new launcher "will ensure its smart positioning on a ship, as it will be incorporated into the ship's hull," Motovilov said.
"The new launcher's missile firing interval has been reduced by six times, which is important for rapid fire," he said.
CHELYABINSK. July 8 (Interfax-AVN) - The Makeyev State Missile Center in Miass, Chelyabinsk region, aims to produce 4.3 billion rubles worth of products in 2010, the company said.
"The production will grow by 20.2% in 2010," the company said.
The company produced 3.6 billion rubles worth of products last year.
At the same time, sales revenue may reduce from 3.6 billion rubles to 3.3 billion rubles this year.
State defense orders make up the core of the center's portfolio, the company said. The center has almost designed the first stage of the Rus-M medium space rocket, which will replace Soyuz rockets and will be launched from the Vostochny spaceport in the Amur region.
The center is taking part in the modernization of the Brazilian VLS-1 space rocket. "The center has drafted a plan for upgrading security and reliability of the VLS-1 rocket and an analysis of the rocket's payload," the company said.
"The European Space Agency wishes to launch space rockets with decommissioned sub-based ballistic missiles. Project Expert was proposed in 2009. The fulfillment of this project will require permission from the Defense Ministry," the company said.
MOSCOW. July 8 (Interfax-AVN) - The crew of the International Space Station (ISS) has been unsuccessfully trying to repair the toilet in the station's U.S. segment for several days, an aerospace expert told Interfax-AVN.
"The Russian and U.S. astronauts have turned for help to experts and the toilet designer, the Energia Aerospace Corporation, but to no avail," he said.
The crew replaced the toilet pipe but the toilet still doesn't work. "The station does have spare toilet parts, however deliveries may be necessary," the source said.
Three U.S. astronauts have been using the toilet in the Russian segment of the station and in the Soyuz spaceships, which will return the crews to Earth.
Toilet repairs are not vital, the source noted. "The crew has lots of other work, such as the unloading of the Progress freighter and the continuation of scientific experiments. The experiments are what the station was built for," he said.
The toilet broke down on July 6, which led to the disconnection of the system processing urine into water.
Energia built the toilet for NASA at a cost of $19 million. NASA spent another $250 million on building the water regeneration system.
MOSCOW. July 8 (Interfax-AVN) - Russia's mission control plans to adjust the orbit altitude for the International Space Station, July 16 a tentative date for the operation, a mission control spokesman told Interfax, saying this would be a routine operation aimed at making it easier for spacecraft sent to the ISS to dock with it.
The next flight to the station is scheduled for September 8 - the Progress M-07M spacecraft will take the next shipment of supplies to the ISS.
MOSCOW. July 9 (Interfax-AVN) - The first new-generation space navigation satellite, Glonass-K, for the Russian global satellite navigation system GLONASS, will be launched from the Plesetsk cosmodrome at the end of 2010.
The date of the launch - December 2010 - was confirmed after the Glonass-K satellite's readiness was assessed by a commission at the Reshetnev - Information Satellite Systems company, the developer and manufacturer of the satellite, the corporate newspaper Sibirsky Sputnik writes.
The Glonass-K has a host of technical advantages over its predecessors Glonass and Glonass-M satellites. It is based on a nonpressurized bus, has improved characteristics and its service life is ten years. The launch of the first Glonass-K satellite will mark the beginning of the Russian satellite navigation system's overhaul.
The satellite will be put into a near-earth orbit by a Soyuz-2-1A medium-class launch vehicle with a Fregat upper stage from the Plesetsk cosmodrome.
The year 2010 will also see the launches of six Glonass-M satellites of the previous series, using two Proton-M carrier rockets (each to carry three satellites) with upper stages of the DM series. They will be launched from Baikonur on September 2 and November 10.
MOSCOW. July 9 (Interfax-AVN) - The new Russian spacecraft Rus, whose sketch design has been submitted to the Central Machine-Building Research Institute by the Energia rocket-space corporation, is in need of adjustments, the research institute's General Director Gennady Raikunov told Interfax-AVN
The sketch design will have been studied before the end of the year and the space Agency Roscosmos will decide what further steps will have to be made to develop the new spacecraft before it replaces the spacecraft of the Soyuz series, a source in the Energia corporation said on condition of anonymity.
Energia won a tender in April 2009 to develop the sketch design of an advanced manned spacecraft. Roscosmos announced it needed several modifications, intended for flights to earth and lunar orbits, for repairing satellites and for de-orbiting defunct satellites and space debris. The new spacecraft will also be used in space tourism. The basic modifications will be used for ferrying a six-member crew and a payload of at least 500 kilograms to and from orbit with an autonomous operation of up to five days. The lunar modification is to carry four crewmembers and a payload of up to 100 kilograms in an autonomous flight lasting for up to 14 days.
MOSCOW. July 9 (Interfax-AVN) - The U.S. segment of the International Space Station (ISS) has experienced a breakdown of not only the toilet but also of its oxygen generation system, a source in the space industry told Interfax-AVN on Friday.
"It is just some bad luck for the U.S. segment. Apart from the toilet, the oxygen generation system has also broken down. Now NASA astronauts are using the toilet in the Russian Zvezda module, but oxygen is being supplied to their segment from the Russian Electron system," the source said.
The breakdown of the U.S. oxygen generation system occurred on July 5, but was not officially announced by NASA until this Friday.
Oxygen can also be supplied from the canisters of Russia's Progress cargo ships docked to the station, NASA said on its website on Friday.
The toilet in the ISS' U.S. segment, made by Russian Rocket Space Corporation Energia and bought by NASA for $19 million, broke down on July 6.
The toilet in the U.S. segment could have broken down because of a pump malfunction, the NASA office in Russia told Interfax-AVN on Friday. The astronauts have checked again the toilet functioning systems, as a result of which specialists on the Earth concluded that it is probably due to a malfunction in the pump separator," the source said.
The station has a spare pump and the crew is trained to install it, the NASA official said.
Another possible cause of the breakdown is the toilet systems' control unit, according to the NASA website.
On July 8 the ISS crew replaced the oxygen intake but it failed to repair the system. The toilet control panel was switched off twice after its launch.
Three NASA astronauts continue using the toilet in the Russian segment, the NASA website said.
The current ISS international crew consists of Russian cosmonauts Alexander Skvortsov, Mikhail Korniyenko and Fyodor Yurchikhin, as well as U.S. astronauts Tracey Caldwell-Dyson, Shannon Walker and Douglas Wheelock.
MOSCOW. July 9 (Interfax-AVN) - Russia's leading rocket companies are developing space shuttles, Gennady Raikunov, the general director of the Central Machine-Building Research Institute, told Interfax-AVN.
"But their use should not be expected soon and they will likely appear after 2025-30, or even after 2035," he said.
On the advantages of using space shuttles, he said, "there won't be any need to waste so much metal and material, which fall off [during launch] and are never used again."
Restricted zones, where the separated stages fall onto, which are often polluted by toxic fuel, will become redundant, Raikunov also said.
One space shuttle can be used a dozen times, he said. This will cut spending on production. Space shuttles will have ample capabilities to maneuver and to put payloads into various orbits, he said.
Russia's leading firms - the Khrunichev space center, Energia corporation and TsSKB-Progress - are working on this radically new carrier rocket, Raikunov said.
MOSCOW. July 9 (Interfax) - Specialists from Rocket Space Corporation Energy have been called in to help repair the broken toilet in the U.S. segment of the International Space Station (ISS), Energia's First Deputy General Designer and head of the ISS Russian segment Vladimir Solovyov told Interfax-AVN on Friday.
"Certainly, Energia specialists are working on it. We have provided product guarantees and we are living up to them by helping U.S. colleagues," Solovyov said.
The breakdown was caused by "the not quite proper functioning of the urine removal pump system," he said.
"The pump is working automatically and manually. The manual duty is not coherent with the automatic one," the official said.
The U.S. segment toilet made by Energia Corporation and bought by NASA for $19 million broke down on July 6 and the U.S. oxygen generation system broke down on July 5.
The life support system in the U.S. segment operates differently from similar systems installed in the Russian segment, Solovyov said. Russian systems are more reliable and less dependent on the external factors, he said.
"Overall, life support systems on the U.S. segment are much less reliable than in the Russian segment. They break down often," Solovyov said.
The toilet broke down because "of improper maintenance," he said.
It is not known how soon the oxygen generator will be made operational, he said. "Its breakdown did not cause any problem. There are back-up sources," the official said.
To supply oxygen to the ISS, the Russian Electron system is being used, along with oxygen supplies delivered by the Russian Progress cargo ship, he said.
By trying to reach oxygen canisters, the ISS crew will unload Progress quicker, Solovyov joked.
MOSCOW. July 9 (Interfax-AVN) - The idea of building reusable spacecraft has a future but not on the format employed by the Buran and space shuttle projects, head of the Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos) Anatoly Perminov says.
"The idea of making reusable spacecraft is good in itself and will definitely be applied in the future," he said answering questions from students at an international scientific school on Tuesday.
Perminov is quoted in a report posted on the Roscosmos website.
He also said that the Buran project will not be revived. "I did not want to disappoint you but it is best to say from the very start that we are not planning to do that," he said.
He said that the main reasons why Russia and the United States have given up space shuttles are that they are costly to service and are unreliable.
"It costs NASA up to $500 million to launch one shuttle. This is a lot even for such a country as the United States," Perminov said.
Besides, 100% reliability of reusable spacecraft has not been guaranteed yet and the two disasters involving space shuttles prove that, he said.
"Despite the differences in the composition between Buran and [U.S. space] shuttles, Buran still has all the same shortcomings. This direction has proved to be unprofitable and dangerous," Perminov said.
MOSCOW. July 9 (Interfax-AVN) - Russia will be unable to arrange a human mission to Mars before 2035 because there are no technologies today that would permit taking humans to the red planet quickly and safely, head of the Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos) Anatoly Perminov says.
"No country will be able to conduct a fast flight to Mars or any other planet alone in the next few years. Everything boils down to energy matters. That is why our plans show dates after 2035," he said answering questions from students of an international scientific school.
Perminov is quoted in a report posted on the Roscosmos website.
He said that the main difficulty is that there are no "engines or fuel of a class that could take humans to Mars in no more than two-three months." A nuclear-powered engine currently being developed in Russia should facilitate such a mission.
"Many countries are working on a new engine type that would allow reducing the duration of the mission by 20 times, that is from a year and a half to two months," Perminov said.
MOSCOW. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - Russia is buying the Mistral helicopter carrier with the French technical stuffing, including the combat navigation system, but the weaponry and helicopters will be Russian, a source in the Russian military-industrial complex, participating in the Mistral talks, told reporters on Monday.
"We are buying not just the warship, but also the entire engineering data. The third warship of this class is to be built at a Russian shipyard. This is our mandatory condition in the Mistral talks," the source said.
"The helicopters will be Russian-made, but the deck will have to be raised a little. We plan to use this helicopter carrier in the northern latitudes, in the ice-sealed regions. Therefore, the board will have to be strengthened. But, again, this will not involve any serious changes in the design, or equipment," he said.
The source denied reports that Russia is allegedly buying the hull alone. "I would like to make a point that we are buying the Mistral with the entire navigation and engineering equipment, including the combat navigation component," he said.
The Mistral multifunctional helicopter carrier has the standard displacement of 16,500 tonnes, the length of 199 meters, the beam of 32 meters and the draft of 6.2 meters. The maximum speed is 18.8 knots, and the voyage range is 19,800 miles.
The ship carries 16 helicopters (including eight landing helicopters and eight assault helicopters). Six helicopters can be placed on the ship's deck simultaneously. Also the ship carries four light landing cutters or two air-cushion landing cutters.
The cargo deck with the length of 122 meters and the width of 13.5 meters can carry up to 1,100 tonnes of cargo, up to 470 marines (900 on short distances), 40 tanks or 70 vehicles. The ship is armed with two Simbad air defense launchers, two 30-millimeter Breda-Mauser artillery systems and four 2.7-millimeter machine guns.
The ship has a hospital with 69 beds and carries up to 150 staff officers. The crew size is 160, including 20 officers.
The French Navy has two Mistral helicopter carriers and is building a third one.
According to unofficial sources, the ship costs about 600 million euros.
KHABAROVSK. July 8 (Interfax) - In response to a letter by the staff of the Defense Ministry's Plant No. 30 (Primorye Territory), in which they poke against the disposal of a nuclear submarine at the plant, experts from the plant Zvezda responsible for disposal said the submarine disposal is safe to both the plant and the nearby village of Dunai.
"The disposal procedure will follow a classical scheme safe to the enterprise staff involved in the operation and the environment. The disposal of nuclear submarine No. 175 is among this year's top priorities set by the Russian government," Andrei Rassmakhin, general director of OAO Zvezda, told a briefing.
Alexander Kisilev, the head of the disposal department, said no work will be done in the reactor compartment of the submarine.
"The submarine is now air-tight and the reactor compartment is reliably isolated from the environment and will not have any effect. Specialists forecast that there will be no worsening of the radiation background in the area," he said.
At the same time, it is now much more dangerous to delay the disposal of the submarine. The head of the disposal department said the state of the hull and containers ensuring the floatability of the submarine is "unacceptable."
According to earlier reports, the staff of the Defense Ministry's Plant No. 30 have recently issued a address to the administration of the plant Zvezda saying the disposal of the nuclear submarine K-431, in which ten people were killed in an accident in 1985, will pose a danger to the plant and the nearby territories.
SEVERODVINSK. July 8 (Interfax-AVN) - The Severodvinsk nuclear-powered submarine has been launched from the Sevmash shipyard dock, the shipyard newspaper Korabel said.
Several towboats took the submarine out of the dock in a joint operation of shipyard personnel and submarine crewmembers.
"The startup of the fourth-generation reactor will be a landmark event. If the startup is successful, we will celebrate the victory together with the Afrikantov Machine Building Design Bureau," a plant representative told Interfax.
According to open sources, the OK-650V is a fourth generation, water-cooled, water-moderated thermal neutron mono-bloc reactor. It is capable of working for 25-30 years (the submarine service life) without recharging.
Sevmash started building the Severodvinsk in 1993, as the head sub of Project 855 Yasen.
The submarine can move at 16 knots on the surface and 31 knots underwater. The maximum depth of submersion is 600 meters. The autonomous voyage can last for 100 days. The submarine has a crew of 90 men, a surface displacement of 8,600 tonnes, an undersea displacement of 13,800 tonnes, a length of 119 meters, the maximum width of 13.5 meters, and a height of 9.4 meters.
The Severodvinsk is armed with ten 650-millimeter and 533-millimeter torpedo tubes, P-100 Onix anti-ship cruise missiles, X-35 anti-ship cruise missiles, X-101 strategic cruise missiles, 3M-54E and 3M-54E1 anti-ship cruise missiles and 3M-14E cruise missiles for shooting land-based targets.
KALININGRAD. July 8 (Interfax-AVN) - The Kaliningrad Yantar shipyard began the construction of an oceanographic vessel for the Russian Navy on Thursday, an Interfax correspondent reported from the shipyard.
The vessel of Project 22010 will have a displacement of 5,230 tonnes, a length of 108 meters and a width of 17.2 meters.
The Almaz Design Bureau designed the ship.
The construction is scheduled to finish in 2013. In addition the shipyard will build two auxiliary vessels for 7 billion rubles.
The construction of the first auxiliary ship of Project 11982, the Seliger, started in July 2009.
BLAGOVESHCHENSK. July 5 (Interfax) - Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has ordered to quickly improve the national border infrastructure in the Far East similarly to how the same was done in the Caucasus.
"Our business ties with neighbors are actively growing, and the success of this task will depend on resolution of the border and customs issues," the president said at a meeting that focused on the customs and migration problems in the border regions.
Another task is to protect the natural and biological resources in the Far East, the president said. "This has to be sorted out. This is a very difficult topic, and no result has been achieved throughout all the years it was being dealt with," the president said. "This requires better legislation and better control," the Russian president said.
CHITA. July 5 (Interfax) - World's largest military training ground at Telemba in Russia's Siberian military district will soon be expanded to enable tests of the newest S-400 surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems, head of the training ground Col. Sergei Kuryshkin said on Saturday.
"Currently, we are considering using the training ground for S-400 SAMs and other advanced systems," he said.
This will require a significant extension of the training ground's area, Kuryshkin said.
"Currently, we are in talks with the administration of the Republic of Buryatia over the handover of an additional 160 kilometer long, 70 kilometer wide land plot to the training ground," said the head of the training ground.
The land plot in question will not be attached permanently, but only for the duration of a firing period, following which it will be returned to the regional authorities, he said.
KYIV. July 8 (Interfax-AVN) - The Kharkiv Malyshev Plant is modernizing Topaz armored personnel carriers and T-62 tanks for Egypt, a plant source told Interfax.
The five-year contract was signed in January, on results of an international tender. The value of the contract has not been disclosed.
The deliveries of the modernized armor will start in the middle of 2011.
ZHUKOVSKY, Moscow region. July 2 (Interfax-AVN) - Alexei Fyodorov, head of Russia's United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), has said he does not rule out that India could order more Sukhoi Su-30MKI multifunction fighter jets from Russia in the near future.
"The chance of India buying another batch of Su-30MKI planes is quite real. As far as we know, the Indian side needs them. We hope that all this will evolve into a concrete order in the near future," Fyodorov told Interfax-AVN on the sidelines of the Engineering Technologies 2010 international forum in Zhukovsky, outside Moscow, on Friday.
The number of fighter jets India could order from Russia is quite large, and it will keep enterprises of the Irkut corporation busy for nearly the whole of next year, he said.
Commenting on whether or not Malaysia could purchase more Sukhoi Su-30MKM fighter jets from Russia, the official said that the Malaysian government had not yet decided what it would buy and when.
"If they decide to purchase multifunction combat airplanes, we will certainly be among the main potential suppliers," he said.
Malaysia successfully uses 18 Su-30MKM fighter jets purchased from Russia earlier, he said.
The Indian cabinet agreed to allocate $3.235 billion to purchase 42 Su-30MKI fighter jets from Russia.
ZHUKOVSKY, Moscow region. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - A large shipment of Russian BMP-3 armored personnel carriers to Greece is possible no earlier than in two years, head of the Rosoboronexport delegation to the Machine Building Technologies forum Alexander Yemelyanov told reporters on Thursday.
"There is an intergovernmental agreement on the delivery of a large number of BMP-3 vehicles to Greece. The drafting of a contract was in progress when the crisis began, and the process slowed down. I do not think the work can resume within the next two years," he said.
The contract will depend on Greece's ability to cope with economic problems and the political will of the Greek government to buy armaments, he said.
"It is difficult to make a forecast," Yemelyanov concluded.
ZHUKOVSKY, Moscow region. July 5 (Interfax-AVN) - It is possible to deliver Iskander-E tactical missile systems to Syria after the local demand is fully met, head of the Rosoboronexport delegation to the Machine Building Technologies forum Alexander Yemelyanov said on Thursday.
"It is necessary to wait a bit, and the Syrians know that," he said in reply to an Interfax-AVN question.
Plants producing Iskander systems will soon be working for the Russian Defense Ministry, he said.
Yemelyanov did not rule out future deliveries to Syria.
Syria asked Russia to sell the systems several years ago, but Moscow abstained from delivering offensive armaments to Damascus.
The Iskander-E takeoff weight is 3,800 kilograms, including 480 kilograms of payload. The system is capable of hitting targets at a range of 280 kilometers and destroying two targets at an interval of one minute.
ZHUKOVSKY (Moscow region). July 1 (Interfax-AVN) - The decision on the supply of Russian helicopters to Afghanistan is current at the stage of working consultations, Russia's permanent representative to NATO Dmitry Rogozin told Interfax-AVN.
"Such agreements should be reached with regard for the commercial component. Providing assistance to the poor Afghanistan is one thing, but if it's a project related to NATO, a joint project, a decision on it should be made on the commercial basis," Rogozin told reporters on Thursday.
The decision on the supply of helicopters to Afghanistan has not been taken off the agenda, he said. "Putting it mildly, the issue has entered the stage of working consultations," Rogozin said.
Rogozin earlier said that "Russia will soon make a decision on the transfer of military helicopters to Afghanistan." "It will be made very soon," he said during a televised linkup from Brussels in May 2010.
At the same time, Rogozin reiterated that Russia will link this issue to the permission for direct sales of Russian weapons to NATO countries.
"We intend to seek a direct opportunity to trade in our military-technical products with the NATO countries," he said.
Rogozin recalled that the request to supply Russian helicopters to Afghanistan came from NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen during his visit to Moscow in early 2010.
Rogozin added that Russia would like to tie this issue to a broader context.
"If we are now actively discussing the possibility of the Mistral deal with France, the following question arises: we can buy helicopter carriers, but we can't sell helicopters to France," Rogozin said.
ZHUKOVSKY, Moscow region. July 6 (Interfax-AVN) - Russia's new Kamov Ka-226T multifunction helicopter is successfully undergoing trials in India and is one of the front-runners in a tender announced by the Indian Ground Forces, which plan to purchase 197 such helicopters, said Igor Pshenichny, first deputy executive director of the Russian Helicopters holding.
"The Ka-226T is successfully being tested in India as part of its ongoing tender to purchase around 197 helicopters," Pshenichny said at a session of the business council of the interstate commission for military-economic cooperation, which took place on the sidelines of the Engineering Technologies 2010 international forum in Zhukovsky, outside Moscow, last Friday.
The Ka-226T, which has been presented by Russia's state controlled arms trader Rosoboronexport and Russian Helicopters, can be used for reconnaissance operations, and it is also able to airlift troops and cargo in highly mountainous areas, as well as to provide support for armed forces, he said.
"Our helicopter has undergone both winter- and summer-time trials successfully," he said.
Russia's Ka-226T and the Eurocopter Group's E-145 made it onto the final shortlist for the Indian tender after Italy's Agusta pulled out, Pshenichny said.
MOSCOW. July 8 (Interfax-AVN) - Russian helicopter manufacturers can satisfy the Afghan Air Force's need for military transport helicopters if they are tasked with such a mission, a source from the Russian defense industry complex told Interfax on Thursday.
"We have not so far been tasked with building helicopters for their further shipment to Afghanistan, but if we are given such a task, we will carry it out," the source said in commenting on a Kommersant report suggesting that Russia and NATO are about to conclude a deal on jointly supplying 21 new military-version Mi-17 helicopters to Kabul.
Afghanistan is currently operating Russian helicopters, which have proven to perform well in mountainous desert conditions, the source said.
The negotiations on shipping helicopters to Afghanistan have been proceeding since the start of 2010, Kommersant said. The matter originally involved 32 helicopters, but then the number in question was reduced. NATO urged Russia to supply them to Afghanistan for free as a contribution to the efforts toward settling the situation in that country, but Moscow insisted on a purely commercial approach.
Russia eventually agreed "to ship several helicopters to Kabul as a goodwill gesture," Kommersant said. NATO will finance the purchase of the rest of the helicopters.
Apart from selling helicopters as such to Afghanistan, Russia will also supply the country with fuel, weapons, and spare parts and will train pilots. The issue is likely to be discussed at a NATO-Russia Council session on July 16.
Considering that the export price of one new Mi-17 varies from $12 million to $15 million depending on how it is equipped, the whole value of the contract could reach $300 million, Kommersant said.
Andrei Shibitov, the executive director of the Russian Helicopters holding company, said earlier, "We have been supplying the coalition forces with the civilian version of the Mi-17 transport helicopter for three years."
