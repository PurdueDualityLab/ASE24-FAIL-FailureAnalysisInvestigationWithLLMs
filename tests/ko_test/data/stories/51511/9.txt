An unmanned Russian supply vessel docked Sunday without trouble at the International Space Station, two days after a technical glitch forced a similar docking to be aborted.
Space officials said they managed to avoid the radio signal problems that forced them to abandon last week's docking of the Progress M-06M cargo ship, launched on June 30. The ship is carrying 2.6 tonnes of fuel, food and water for the three Russia and three U.S. astronauts on the station.
An attempted docking on Friday was aborted when a radio link with the ISS was lost about 25 minutes before the planned rendezvous.
Sunday's successful docking was done automatically under the supervision of experts in Moscow and the ISS team, it said, without using the radio link. Progress launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on June 30.
It is the 40th Russian cargo vessel to dock at the station, the centre said.
In contrast to the troubles that plagued the first rendezvous attempt, Sunday's second try "was executed flawlessly," the U.S. space agency NASA said on its website.
