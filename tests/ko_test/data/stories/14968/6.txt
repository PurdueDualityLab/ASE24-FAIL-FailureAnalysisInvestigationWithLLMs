Seattle -- Jobe concludedthat the injury can be treated with rest and light exercise, with hope that Mondesi will respond quickly and be ready to play next Saturday when he is eligible to be activitated from the 15-day disabled list.
The 29-year-old has beenan integral part of the Jays this season, after coming over from the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange for Shawn Green.
Mondesi is hitting .272with 24 home runs, 67 RBI, 22 stolen bases and 78 runs scored. He is also Toronto's best defensive outfielder and one of the team's leaders.
Canadian Rob Ducey, whowas obtained in a trade Wednesday, took Mondesi's place on the 25-man roster and will be part of a platoon with Marty Cordova in right. Ducey hits from the left side, Cordova from the right.
SEATTLE -- Jim Fregosifigured he would eventually reach this milestone. Fregosi posted his 1,000th victory as a major-league manager and Esteban Loaiza earned his first win for Toronto as the Blue Jays rallied past the Seattle Mariners 7-2 Thursday night.
"When you manage for 50years, you should get a thousand," Fregosi joked. "It's nice, especially when you look back at some of the clubs I've been with and some of the struggles. It really is nice."
Pinch-hitter ToddGreene's two-run single keyed a five-run seventh inning. Greene has been successful in pinch-hit situations this season, going 4-for-9 with three RBI.
Seattle matched a season high with its third straight loss, and had its eight-game winning streak against Toronto stopped.
Fregosi is now1,000-1,063 with the Blue Jays, Philadelphia, the Chicago White Sox and the Angels. He is 46th manager to win 1,000 games in the majors.
The game was delayed 17minutes when a bank of Safeco Field lights went out in the bottom of the third inning. Last Saturday, there was a rain delay when the stadium's retractable roof failed to shut. Both times, blame was laid on a computer glitch.
Loaiza (6-7) limitedSeattle to two runs and six hits in seven innings. Earlier this season when he pitched for Texas, he was 0-2 with a 22.23 ERA in two starts against the Mariners.
"You can't worry aboutwhat happens in the past in this game," Loaiza said. "Every day is different and every game is different. You just have to keep a consistently positive attitude and try to win every game."
Seattle starter John Halama was not sharp, allowing 10 hits, three walks and one earned run over 52/3 innings.
