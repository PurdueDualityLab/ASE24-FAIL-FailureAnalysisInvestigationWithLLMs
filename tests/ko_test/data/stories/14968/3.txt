Seattle -- "When youmanage for 50 years, you should get a thousand," Fregosi joked. "It's nice, especially when you look back at some of the clubs I've been with and some of the struggles. It really is nice."
Pinch-hitter ToddGreene's two-run single keyed a five-run seventh inning. Greene has been successful in pinch-hit situations this season, going 4-for-9 with three RBIs.
"I've never done well inthose situations until this year," said Greene, a backup outfielder for the Blue Jays. "I never understood my role in the past, but here it's pretty simple. Whether I get a hit or not, I know that I'm not going to start the next day. I don't have a lot of pressure on me."
Seattle matched a season high with its third straight loss, and had its eight-game winning streak against Toronto stopped.
The Blue Jays won withoutright-fielder Raul Mondesi, who was put on the 15-day disabled list because of ligament damage in his right elbow. Mondesi, batting .272 with 24 home runs and 67 RBIs, was examined during the day in Los Angeles by Dr. Frank Jobe, who said more testing is needed.
"I don't think there isany question that we are going to miss him," said Fregosi. "He's had a great season for us, and has been a leader in the clubhouse. We've just got to battle through it, and win some games while he's out."
Fregosi is now1,000-1,063 with the Blue Jays, Philadelphia, the Chicago White Sox and the Angels. He is 46th manager to win 1,000 games in the majors.
The game was delayed 17minutes when a bank of Safeco Field lights went out in the bottom of the third inning. Last Saturday, there was a rain delay when the stadium's retractable roof failed to shut. Both times, a computer glitch was blamed.
With two outs in theseventh, Greene singled off Arthur Rhodes (3-5) to put the Blue Jays ahead 3-2. Alex Gonzalez also hit a two-run single, and another run scored on third baseman David Bell's error.
Loaiza (6-7) limitedSeattle to two runs and six hits in seven innings. Earlier this season when he pitched for Texas, he was 0-2 with a 22.23 ERA in two starts against the Mariners.
"You can't worry aboutwhat happens in the past in this game," Loaiza said. "Every day is different and every game is different. You just have to keep a consistently positive attitude and try to win every game."
Seattle starter John Halama was not sharp, allowing 10 hits, three walks and one earned run over 5 2/3 innings.
"Toronto leads the leaguein home runs, so you have to go out there with your 'A' game or they'll put some quick numbers on you," Halama said. "I made some good pitches, but they hit whatever I threw up there."
Toronto scored in the first on singles by Shannon Stewart and Homer Bush and a double by Carlos Delgado.
Dan Wilson led off the Mariners fifth with a double and scored on Rickey Henderson's double.
Seattle later took a 2-1lead on an RBI single by Alex Rodriguez. It was his first RBI since returning from the disabled list on Monday. In the three games he has played, he is hitting .455 (5-for-11).
