"* Seattle's offense continues to struggle.
SEATTLE - Sure, when the lights went off at Safeco Field Thursday night, it had nothing to do with the Seattle Mariners' own recent power outage.
But the symbolism wasn't lost on those who follow the team.
In the Mariners' 7-2defeat to the Toronto Blue Jays, Seattle's offense continued to be in the dark. Toronto simply waited for Mariner pitching to crack, which it finally did in the seventh inning.
The defeat was theMariners' third in a row, which ties a season-high. The last such string was in May 23-25 in Baltimore. They are 7-8 since the All-Star break.
These days, that's the only aspect of the club that's even remotely offensive.
The Mariners made BlueJays starting pitcher Esteban Loaiza (6-7) look like a contender for the Cy Young Award. In seven innings, Loaiza allowed just six hits, two runs, struck out six and walked two. This, coming from a guy Seattle battered for eight runs in 2 2/3 innings May 9, when he pitched for Texas.
None of the power that seeped out of the SafecoField lighting system dropped into the Mariner bats. It may take that to shake the team out of its slumber. Monday's trading deadline looms, and it's no secret that general manager Pat Gillick is scouring Major League rosters for a bat - left-handed, right-handed or wrong-handed. It hardly matters at this point.
Seattle mustered two runsin the fifth, which qualifies as a veritable outburst lately. Until then, the Mariners had gone scoreless in 12 straight innings.
The stadium turned dark because of a computer glitch.The lights over left field, the clock in left and most of the lights down the third-base line slowly petered out in the bottom of the third inning. Umpires called the game while workers feverishly worked on the stadium's computer system.
So, the SafecoField brass entertained the 40,398 in attendance with a recording of Bruce Springsteen's Dancin' in the Dark"" blaring over the sound system and with live video of fat guys in funny hats, boogieing in the stands.
The lights went on 10 minutes later and the game resumed after an 18-minute delay.
So if you're scoring at home, that's one power outage and one roof malfunction in five days.
And one team with power issues of its own.
The Mariners that hadn'tscored a run since the first inning on Wednesday against the Oakland A's. Rickey Henderson's one-out, fifth-inning RBI double off Loaiza in the left-field corner drove in Dan Wilson, and the Mariners' 12-inning scoreless streak was done.
Henderson seemed to giveSeattle's slumbering offense life, if only for a moment. Alex Rodriguez, celebrating his 25th birthday, drove in Henderson with a sharp single to center, and suddenly, Seattle led, 2-1.
The Mariners kept itclose with their defense, which turned three double plays in the first five innings. Despite giving up just one earned run, starting pitcher John Halama wasn't sharp, allowing leadoff runners to reach base in four of the six innings he walked out to the mound.
Halama allowed 10 hits, walked three and struck out four in 523 innings before giving way to Jose Paniagua.
The Blue Jays struck a decisive blow in the seventh with five runs.
Todd Greene'sbases-loaded, two-out, two-run single up the middle off Arthur Rhodes gave the Blue Jays a 3-2 lead they would never relinquish.
