The Texas-Seattle game was halted for 54 minutes by rain Saturday when Safeco Field's retractable roof failed to close because of a computer glitch.
The roof started to shut, but didn't get far before it stopped. About 20 minutes later, the roof began to close as the fans applauded. The game resumed after groundskeepers worked to dry out the field.
The umpires stopped the game after three innings with the Mariners and Rangers tied at 2. A tarp was then unfurled to cover the infield and many fans scurried for cover.
The roof has been closed for parts or all of eight of the Mariners' 45 home games this season.
Despite leaden skies, Saturday's game began with the roof open. In Friday night's game between the teams, a 12-3 Seattle victory, the roof was closed in the second inning after it began to rain.
The Mariners moved into their $517.6 million stadium in the middle of last season after playing 22 1/2 seasons in the Kingdome.
There was never a rainout there, but a game with Cleveland in the Kingdome was suspended in the seventh inning when an earthquake rocked Seattle May 2, 1996. On July 19, 1994, ceiling tiles fell in the Kingdome before a game between the Mariners and Baltimore, forcing Seattle to finish the season on the road.
The last rain delay in Seattle was Sept. 12, 1969, when the Pilots played the California Angels at Sicks Stadium. That game was completed the next day.
The Kingdome was imploded in March in order to make way for a new outdoor football stadium. Sicks Stadium was torn down when the Pilots left Seattle after one season and became the Milwaukee Brewers.
