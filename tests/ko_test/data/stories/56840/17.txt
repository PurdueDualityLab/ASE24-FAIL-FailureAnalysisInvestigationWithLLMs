Fukuoka, Dec. 10 (JijiPress)--Coolant water containing radioactive materials has leaked inside the Genkai nuclear power plant in the southwestern Japan prefecture of Saga, officials at the plant's operator said Saturday.
About 1.8 tons of coolant water leaked inside a pump system at the No. 3 reactor at the Genkai plant run by Kyushu Electric Power Co. .
All leaked water was collected and sent to a tank, officials said, adding that the incident poses no safety problem.
The company noticed the leak Friday morning when an alarm sounded for unusual rises in temperatures in the pump system.
The company announced the pump glitch Friday afternoon. But it made no mention of the water leak at that time.
The power firm reported the leak to the host municipality of Genkai only on Saturday morning.
Kyushu Electricsaid it thought it did not need to report the leak because the incident did not resulted in any leak of radioactive substances outside the plant.
The No. 3 reactor has been offline since December last year when inspections began.
