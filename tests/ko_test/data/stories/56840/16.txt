World News: New Leak Detected At Nuclear Facility

TOKYO -- A new leak of contaminated water has been detected at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear complex, raising concerns about the possibility of additional radioactive materials reaching the ocean waters adjacent to the plant.
A pool of about 45 metric tons of contaminated water was found Sunday morning around a condensation unit used by a water-purification system, the plant's operator Tokyo Electric Power Co. said on Sunday.
While Tepco said the leak wouldn't affect its operation to cool the reactors at the plant, the latest leak again highlights how vulnerable its current make-shift water-purification system is to glitches.
The development comes a couple of weeks before Tepco is expected to announce a cold shutdown of the plant, a condition in which damaged reactor fuel is brought under stable control, an important yardstick of progress.
Tepco said it shut down the condensation unit after subcontractors found the pool of water, but a later inspection showed that water was leaking from a crack in a concrete wall.
Tepco has been storing and treating contaminated water in existing facilities converted into a makeshift water treatment system as hundreds of thousands of tons of water poured over the damaged reactors continue to leak and flood facilities at the plant.
The water in the pool has already been treated for cesium contamination, but Tepco said the water may contain other radioactive materials, such as beta-ray emitting strontium.
The utility said beta-ray radiation from the surface of the pool was measured at 110 millisieverts per hour. At that level, a worker at the plant would be exposed to the maximum level of radiation allowed under revised government regulations in about 2 1/2 hours.
In addition to concerns over the increased risk to workers cleaning up the leak at the plant is the possibility that the water may be leaking into the sea, potentially causing contamination of the food chain. A local media report citing Tepco officials said 220 metric tons of water may have leaked from the facility with some of this reaching the sea, 500 meters away.
