Eight major Japanese automakers saw their combined global output fall 3 pct from a year before to 1,909,857 units in November, down for the first time in four months, due chiefly to flooding in Thailand, according to press releases Thursday.
Global production plunged 30.1 pct at Honda Motor Co. because the massive floods forced Honda to close its Thai assembly plant and caused glitches in parts supplies to domestic plants.
Global output fell 11.4 pct at Mazda Motor Corp. , which also halted production of some models in Thailand, while Toyota Motor Corp. suffered a 3.4 pct decline.
By contrast, Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. , which produces Subaru models, saw its global production soar 21.1 pct as the flooding had little effect.
Output grew 19.1 pct at Nissan Motor Co. , which ramped up production in China and Mexico.
The total overseas production at the eight automakers, also including Daihatsu Motor Co. , Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and Suzuki Motor Corp. , slid 7.4 pct to 1,114,961 units, down for two months in a row.
Their domestic production rose 4.0 pct to 794,896 units, up for the second straight month, in a rebound from November last year, when auto output slumped following the termination of government subsidies for buyers of eco-friendly vehicles.
But the pace of growth slowed substantially from 19.7 pct in October.
A meager 1.0 pct increase was logged in exports, with the yen's appreciation taking its toll on profitability.
Following are company-by-company unit production figures in November with year-on-year percentage changes in parentheses:
