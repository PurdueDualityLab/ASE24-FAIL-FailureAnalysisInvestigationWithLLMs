World News: New Water Leak Detected At Japanese Nuclear Plant

TOKYO -- A new leak of contaminated water has been detected at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear complex, raising concerns about the possibility of additional radioactive materials reaching the ocean waters adjacent to the plant.
A pool of about 45 metric tons of contaminated water was found Sunday morning around a condensation unit used by a water-purification system, the plant's operator Tokyo Electric Power Co. said in a statement. The utility said Monday that almost all the leaked water was inside the building housing the unit, adding that it doesn't know if any of the leaked water has reached the sea near the plant.
Tepco says the leak won't affect its scheduled operation to cool the reactors, but the latest problem has exposed workers to radiation risks and highlights how vulnerable its makeshift water-purification system is to glitches. The company said the water was treated for radioactive iodine and cesium, but not for other radioactive materials.
The development comes just a couple of weeks before Tepco is expected to announce a cold shutdown of the plant, a condition in which damaged reactor fuel is brought under stable control, an important yardstick of progress in tackling the nuclear accident.
The leak was spotted Sunday morning by subcontractors prompting Tepco to shut down the condensation unit. By the time sandbags had been used to contain it on Sunday afternoon, up to 300 liters (about 80 gallons) of the pool of water may have escaped into an adjacent gutter leading to the sea about 500 meters (550 yards) away, Tepco said Monday.
The utility has been storing and treating contaminated water in existing facilities converted into a water-treatment system as hundreds of thousands of tons of water poured over the damaged reactors to cool them continue to leak and flood facilities at the plant. The system was thought to be running smoothly after a string of earlier glitches led to repeated suspensions when it started operating in June.
Tepco said the leaked water contains very little cesium. But the water may contain other harmful substances, such as beta-ray emitting strontium, which is known for causing bone cancers. It may take two to three weeks before it can be determined how much strontium is contained in the water, the utility also said.
The utility said beta-ray radiation from the surface of the pool was measured at 110 millisieverts per hour. At that level, a worker at the plant would be exposed to the maximum level of radiation allowed under revised government regulations in around two and a half hours.
