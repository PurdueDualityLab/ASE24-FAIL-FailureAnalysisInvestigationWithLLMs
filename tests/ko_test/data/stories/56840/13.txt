Tokyo, Dec. 13 (JijiPress)--Japan's nuclear plant utilization rate rose in November after eight months of decline, thanks to a resumption of a southwestern Japan reactor, an industry group said Tuesday.
The utilization rate rose 1.6 percentage points from October to 20.1 pct, the Federation of Electric Power Companies said.
The percentage had been on the decline since March when the country's nuclear crisis began as Tokyo Electric Power Co.'s Fukushima No. 1 power plant was crippled by tsunami.
The figure rose on the Nov. 2 resumption of the No. 4 reactor at Kyushu Electric Power Co.'s Genkai plant, which had been suspended due to a glitch.
But the utilization rate is expected to restart falling soon as the Genkai reactor and the No. 2 reactor at Kansai Electric Power Co.'s Oi plant are set to go offline this month due to routine inspections.
It remains uncertain whenthe country will be able to resume operations at suspended reactors. At present, the country has 54 reactors, of which only eight are operating.
The federation also saidthe total amount of electricity generated and procured by 10 major power firms in November fell 5.4 pct from a year earlier to 72.05 billion kilowatt-hours.
The amount lost groundfor the ninth consecutive month thanks to relatively warm weather and energy-saving efforts by users, the federation said.
Tokyo Electric posted a drop of 8.3 pct and Tohoku Electric Power Co. reported a decrease of 9.2 pct, both the steepest drop for November.
