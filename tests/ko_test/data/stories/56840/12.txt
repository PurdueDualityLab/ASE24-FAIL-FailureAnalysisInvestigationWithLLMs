Tokyo, Dec. 27 (Jiji Press)--Immediately after the gigantic earthquake on March 11, 65.4 pct of people living along the sawtooth coastline in northeastern Japan predicted the ensuing tsunami while 58.7 pct of those living more inland did not, a land ministry survey has shown.
The survey, conducted between September and December, covered 9,574 residents in 62 municipalities in six prefectures--Aomori, Iwate, Miyagi, Fukushima, Ibaraki and Chiba--along the Pacific Ocean whose homes were damaged by the tsunami. Of them, 90.1 pct saw their homes either swept away or destroyed.
During the time between the 9.0-magnitude quake and tsunami warnings, 45.4 pct of those living in the ria coast areas from Misawa in Aomori to Ishinomaki's Ojika Peninsula in Miyagi said they thought a tsunami would definitely come and 20 pct thought there was a possibility.
Among residents in flat inland areas from downtown Ishinomaki to Ichinomiya in Chiba, the combined proportion of the two answers stood at a mere 41.3 pct.
In contrast, 32.4 pct said they hardly considered the possibility of a tsunami and 26.3 pct did not believe the quake would trigger it.
Of those who anticipated the tsunami, 86.1 pct said the shake was very big, and 21.4 pct in the ria coastal and 13.9 pct in inland areas said they remembered tsunami stories passed down from older generations.
Asked about reasons for ruling out the possibility of a tsunami, 34.7 pct of coastal residents said they live far from the ocean, while 44.3 pct of inland dwellers said their assumption was based on their own experiences and knowledge.
Among people who heard tsunami warnings, 64.2 pct of coastal residents and 57.2 pct of inland residents thought they should evacuate immediately.
Meanwhile, a combined 9.8 pct said they did not take the warnings seriously enough to leave.
Those who checked tsunami prevention maps distributed by municipalities before the March disaster accounted for 45.9 pct in the coastal regions and 24.9 pct in inland areas.
On the maps, however, only 50.2 pct of homes in the coastal areas and 32.5 pct in the flat areas were supposed to be hit by tsunami.
A detailed survey covering 4,421 of all respondents revealed that 62.6 pct began evacuating before the tsunami reached their homes, while 26.8 pct did not.
As major obstacles during evacuation, 46.9 pct of the coastal residents cited traffic signal glitches, while 48.1 pct of the inlanders pointed to traffic jams.END
