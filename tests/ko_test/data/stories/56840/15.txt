Fukuoka, Dec. 26 (Jiji Press)--Kyushu Electric Power Co.halted operations at the No. 4 reactor at its Genkai nuclear power station Sunday night for routine maintenance, bringing all nuclear reactors in its service area offline.
The utility, covering theKyushu southwestern region, had already suspended its other five reactors--the No. 1 to No. 3 Genkai reactors in Saga Prefecture and the No. 1 and No. 2 reactors at the Sendai plant in Kagoshima Prefecture.
It is the first time thatthe number of active nuclear reactors in the region became zero since the Genkai No. 1 reactor, the first such facility there, was idled for routine check in 1980.
The move cut thecompany's electricity supply capacity to 14.69 million kilowatts, a meager 0.8 pct excess over maximum demand of 14.57 million kilowatts estimated for this winter.
The situation raises concern that supply shortages will occur with unexpected cold waves or possible glitch-triggered suspensions of the company's thermal power stations.
In order to address the concern, Kyushu Electricasked corporate clients and households in its service area to cut electricity use by 5 pct or more Monday through Feb. 3 from the previous winter.
The company also plans tobuy electricity from businesses that have in-house power generation systems and other utilities in an effort to ensure stable supplies.
The company is bracingfor some one billion yen per day in extra costs for liquefied natural gas and other fuels because it faces the need to boost thermal power generation.
