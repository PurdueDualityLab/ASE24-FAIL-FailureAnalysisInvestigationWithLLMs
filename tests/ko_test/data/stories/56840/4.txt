Japan's Kansai Electricsaid Wednesday that it will shut its 500 MW No. 2 nuclear reactor at its Mihama nuclear power plant in western Japan in the early hours of Thursday after finding a glitch.
Kansai Electricplans to start reducing output from around 8pm local time (1100 GMT) Wednesday with an eye to shut the unit by 4am on Thursday, the company said.
Kansai Electric'sshutdown of the Mihama No. 2 reactor means there will be only eight nuclear reactors with a combined power generation capacity of 7.979 GW operating in Japan, 16.3% of the country' total installed capacity of 48.96 GW at 54 reactors, according to calculations by Platts Wednesday.
Nuclear capacity represents 21% of Japan's total installed power generating capacity of 228.479 GW.
Japan has entered itswinter power demand season, which normally runs from December to March. The weather and nuclear utilization rates have a direct impact on crude, fuel oil and LNG consumption for thermal power generation.
Kansai Electric,Japan's second-largest power utility, has estimated it would need need another 4.5 million mt LNG-equivalent of oil and LNG from October 2011 to March 2012 due to its extended nuclear outages. Based on this estimate, Kansai Electric's oil requirements are seen to be about 2 million kl (103,000 b/d) over December-March, Platts reported earlier.
