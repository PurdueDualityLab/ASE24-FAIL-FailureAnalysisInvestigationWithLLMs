Japan's second largest electric power utility Kansai Electric Power Companyhas begun scheduled turnarounds at its 1.175 GW No. 2 Oi nuclear reactor and 500 MW No. 2 Mihama nuclear reactor -- taking the country's nuclear operation rate to a record low of 13.9%, according to Platts calculations.
Kansai shut the Oireactor Friday for about four months, a company official said Monday. The Mihama reactor was shut December 7 due to technical glitch, following which a planned five-month turnaround began Sunday, the official added.
With the shutdowns, onlythe company's 870 MW No. 3 Takahama reactor is operating among all its 11 nuclear reactors with a total capacity of 9.768 GW. This means that Japan's nuclear operation rate has dropped to a record low of 13.9%, with only seven reactors operating out of 54.
The previously low was inOctober this year, when Japan's average nuclear operation rate fell to 18.5%, according to data from the Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan which began recording the rate in April 1977.
The FEPC issues nuclearoperation rates on a monthly basis, and an FEPC official told Platts Monday that the December rate would likely be a record low.
Japanese utilities arefacing difficulty in restarting their nuclear reactors following the March 11 earthquake, and have been boosting oil and LNG consumption as a result.
