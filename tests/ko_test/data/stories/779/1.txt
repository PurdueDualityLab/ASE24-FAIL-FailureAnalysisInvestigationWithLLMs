Hola? Policia?
I would like to report a robbery.
What's that? Yes, the victim is uninjured. Griffin is his name. Eric Griffin. Yeah, the boxer. That's right.
No, he still has his wallet. His watch and twin diamond earrings, too. Oh, and that gold front tooth is still there.
But come quick.
The incompetents have stolen his dream, and the politicians have sold him down the stream.
Even by boxing standards, this is sleaze on parade. It is a convention of back room officials, struggling to defend a flawed scoring system that represents their future even if it means selling out an athlete to do so. It is as if they are saying: Nothing personal, Eric Griffin, you just got in the way.
Want to know why boxing has a bad name? Come for a ride.
The scene of the crime was a boxing ring on Saturday, when Griffin was minding his own business by repeatedly bashing Spain's Rafael Lozano in the face. Another round and Lozano's face would be so flat it would be put next to King Juan Carlos on the 100-peseta coin.
Next thing you know, Griffin was declared a loser. And boxing was right back in the old sewer.
This stinks. Mind you, Griffin didn't just beat Lozano, he ran up the score. This was the 49ers against the Broncos, Georgia Tech against Cumberland.
Put it this way: The 10 people who were responsible for determining who won the fight unanimously agreed that Griffin should have won.
And still he lost.
Of course, all of this was inevitable. Olympic boxing always is a controversy waiting to happen - ask Evander Holyfield and Roy Jones, victims long before Griffin.
Besides, as soon as boxing adopted this new computer scoring system, you knew it was bound to crash.
Think about it: Boxing people with computers. Frightening, isn't it? What's next, cavemen with nuclear reactors?
In this scoring system, five judges sit around five tables with pads about the size of a portable CD player in front of them. If the boxer in blue lands a clear punch, the judge is supposed to push the blue button.
For a punch to count, three judges must hit the button within one second. Otherwise, it doesn't matter if one boxer shoves the nose of the other into his ear; the blow doesn't count and the judge, we suppose, doesn't advance to the next screen of Super Mario Brothers.
The system has been criticized from the start. It doesn't score body punches, doesn't reward flurries. It turns every boxer into a headhunter, for those are the blows obvious to the judges.
Stupid ideas lead to stupid decisions. The only surprise was that it happened to Griffin, a four-time world champion.
All five of the judges - from Ghana, Argentina, Pakistan, Canada and Yugoslavia - had Griffin winning by an average of 16-10. All five jury members (backup judges in case the computer fails) had Griffin winning.
None of it mattered.
Officially, Lozano won 6-5 in the ultimate computer glitch. Evidently, the judges were so slow that some blows they admitted Griffin landed never were registered. Griffin had a standing-eight count on Lozano in the second round - and received no points for it. He had a five-punch flurry in the final seconds of the second round - and received one point. He had a similar flurry late in the fight - and received nothing.
"It's crazy," Griffin said Sunday. "They're bringing people into the Olympics who don't know what's going on. If the computer system doesn't work, we don't need it. We can go back to the old system."
No, they can't. Boxing has been a sport under scrutiny, and this system was created to be the cure for all the politics and protests that have hounded it. There has been a clear statement from the IOC that boxing must clean up its act or take it on the road.
So it was hardly surprising Sunday when IABA (the governing body of amateur boxing) tossed out Griffin's protests with the air that he was a crybaby for even filing it. Had they supported Griffin, it would have admitted a flaw in the system. So they sacrificed Eric Griffin for their own.
Not once in a news conference did any of the three IABA representatives stand up and say, "You are wrong, Lozano won the fight fair and square."
I would disagree, but such views are subjective.
Nor would they say, "We are wrong, but there are judgment calls in sports."
A wronged fighter is nothing new. But to defend a system that encourages injustice is insane.
As it turns out, Griffin is not alone. IABA vice president Arthur Tunstall said Sunday that seven other fights have ended with the five judges saying one boxer won and the computer saying another. Yet, he defends the system: "I think it's working fine."
Fine? When the judges agree a guy wins a fight and he doesn't, that's fine? How arrogant. How insulting.
No wonder Griffin had such a bewildered look Sunday, the look of someone who was trying to figure out what hit him.
He is not an educated man. Sunday, he struggled to spell his son's name. But he has come so far since 1988, when he tested positive for marijuana at the U.S. Trials. He remained an amateur, dreaming of the gold, and was considered his team's best shot. But four years of rebuilding his life destroyed by nine minutes of judges who couldn't push a button, and the governing body could care less.
For U.S. coach Joe Byrd, part of the failure of the system was the age of the referees ("around 65") who were working it.
"You need younger people with better reaction time," Byrd said. "If you have a good typewriter and you don't know how to type, you still don't have nothing. I don't know if some of those people had even seen a computer before the Olympics."
Which brings us to Ghana's Kenneth Dadzie and the question of what in blue blazes he was doing sitting as a judge. Three days earlier, Dadzie had been suspended for failure to score enough punches. Twice, he scored fights 0-0, which means he did not see a punch land by either boxer.
"Maybe he's afraid if he hits the button he'll be electrocuted," Griffin said.
So tell me why a referee in any sport who is suspended should be allowed to return? Yet, there Dadzie was at ringside during the fight. Even then, he registered only 13 blows (the Canadian judge registered 43). You wonder if Dadzie even knows where the button is. Somehow, you get an image of a Badalona garage door raising and lowering as Dadzie hits a switch.
"They ought to take the whole computer system and throw it in the Mediterranean, along with the judges," said Randy Gordon, a New York State boxing commissioner. "It doesn't work. If dishonest people work the computer, it's a dishonest computer. If incompetent people work the computer, it's an incompetent computer."
Yes. And if illogical men defend an illogical scoring system that selects an illogical winner, it isn't hard to figure out the result.
