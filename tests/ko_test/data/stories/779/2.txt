IT wasn't robbery on a grand scale. The people who run the Olympic Games save major larceny for the times when they have to keep Dave Johnson in the decathlon, or keep Sylvie Frechette away from a gold medal.
In fact, Chris Johnson admitted that he lost his bout yesterday with American Chris Byrd.
A win would have given a chance to fight for gold in the middleweight class, the defeat gave him a bronze, Canada's first boxing medal in Barcelona and seventh since 1984. (There will be another today when Toronto's Mark Leduc fights in the light welterweight semi-final, where he is guaranteed at least a bronze.)
But there were certainly extenuating circumstances, and not just the usual excuses that go with the sport. Yesterday, the system let Johnson down.
"I didn't feel robbed," he said, unsuccessfully trying to fight back tears. "I just felt that justice wasn't given."
In 1988, the boxing tournament at Seoul was marred by a number of very, very bad, apparently politically motivated decisions. That wasn't new, though, and it wasn't a surprise, since as in all sports that are judged subjectively, it's easy to be corrupt.
Added to the spectre of brain damage caused by blows to the head, the unfair scoring was on the verge of pushing boxing out of the Olympics altogether. So the sport's great minds got together and found a solution.
What they came up with is the computer system in use here. Five judges sit on the same side of the ring on the floor, a few feet below the level of the canvas. Each has two buttons, red and blue, one for each boxer. The judges are supposed to hit the appropriate button each time they see a legitimate scoring punch - which in amateur boxing, means any blow with the knuckle area of the glove landed above the belt to the torso or the head.
If any three judges hit the same button within a second of each other, the corresponding boxer is awarded a point.
In theory, that's fine, and in practice the system has yielded fewer terrible deicisons than the old one. (World champion Eric Griffin's loss, when all five judges hit his button more often, but not in the proper sequence, was an exception, the ultimate computer glitch.)
But what the computer has also done is fundamentally change the nature of an Olympic boxing contest.
Johnson's fight with Byrd was a classic example. In the first round Johnson came out with his gloves held high, and tried to jab his way inside. Byrd, a boxer in the mold of former middleweight champion Michael Nunn, dropped his hands, leaned away, and flicked out soft, meaningless punches.
Meaningless except in the eyes of the judges, who like any punch landed to the head in the middle of the ring that they can clearly see.
Johnson, on the other hand, did his best work inside, landing hard, powerful shots to the body, then moving up to the head. At the end of the first round, the contest seemed to be close, and it was easy to argue that Johnson was in the lead.
Up on the screen came the score: 7-1 for Byrd, an all but insurmountable total under the new system.
"As soon as I heard the ding at the end of the first round, I went back to my corner feeling great, because I knew I was doing what I wanted to," Johnson said. "Then I looked up and saw the score and I couldn't believe it. They didn't count any of my punches, but they counted everything he threw. After I saw the 7-1 score, it just kind of brought me down dramatically. After that I wasn't able to get myself psyched up."
That pattern continued for the next two rounds, with Byrd becoming ever more elusive and Johnson ever more discouraged. "I was talking to him," Byrd said afterwards. "I was telling him, you can't hurt me, you can't hurt me." The final score had Byrd winning 17-3 to advance to Saturday's final.
Johnson and Byrd are actually good friends, and Johnson is invited to the wedding of Byrd's brother, Patrick, on Aug. 15. "I don't know if he's still coming," Byrd said after the fight.
Still, the Olympic tournament was hardly a washout for Johnson, who turns 21 tomorrow. The Kitchener, Ont., native plans to turn professional along with his brother Greg, who is a welterweight. Here, well known managers and promoters have been all over him.
"I think Greg and I both have the potential to be professional world champions," he said. "I'm going to take a couple of months off, and then take it slow.
"I'm a dreamer," Johnson continued. "One dream ends and another one begins."
