Boxing can't seem to shed sleaze, scandal

BARCELONA - "Gold medal in noise."
"I love to sleep, if you please."
"Quiet room, loud street."
"Contaminated Olympics."
"Leave us alone."
Those angry messages were scrawled on bedsheets, which hung from at least 15 apartment windows adjacent to the gymnasium.
The noise is bad enough. The stench from storm sewers, dumpsters and bus fumes is worse.
Every Olympiad must have a dark side. At these Summer Games, the armpit is a densely populated slum called Pep Ventura and its arena, Pavello Club Joventut, site of Olympic boxing.
Here, the sport has sunk to the level of its surroundings, just like four years ago. In Seoul, crazed crowds overfilling a small gym created a stage for chaos and corruption. Several outcomes ignited near-riots; I've never felt more endangered than during one incident after a South Korean lost.
Boxing was ordered to change after that. International Olympic Committee leaders told the sport to clean up its act or face being removed from the Games. Not coincidentally, boxing was assigned this dank, aging facility here.
Yet, after great expense for new technology in an effort to eradicate wicked judging and scandalous decisions, the sport continues to suffer.
And wouldn't you know, another American has been victimized. In '88 it was Roy Jones, who soundly whipped his South Korean opponent for the gold but lost the fight amid clear indications of bribery. Boxing's establishment circle felt badly enough to honor Jones as the most outstanding boxer of those Games.
Now it's Eric Griffin on the short end. Griffin, a four-time world champion, clearly defeated Rafael Lozano of Spain. But the computerized scoring system, ignoring many inarguable points scored by Griffin, gave Lozano a 6-5 decision.
Appeals failed, but now Brazil has joined the enraged chorus. After one of his boxers lost a similarly debatable 8-7 decision, Brazilian federation president Ralph Adler lashed out.
"The new scoring system is too technical to dispute the final result, because you can't argue with a machine," Adler said. "The computer is unable to answer questions. We are not happy with this system and we hope it won't be used in the next competitions."
Nobody blames the computer for a mediocre U.S. start in boxing. Nine of the 12 Americans have been eliminated before the semifinals.
The computer didn't cause all those defeats. But it did give Griffin, and the guy from Brazil, a raw deal. If the new system malfunctioned even once, it undermines the sport's integrity just as the judging did in Seoul.
Don't dismiss Griffin so fast. He doesn't deserve it. Here's a young athlete destined for pro success. A gold medal would have enhanced his market value tremendously. Now he has to settle for much less as a new pro, and a much tougher road to the top, just because of incompetent judges or a computer glitch. That's injustice.
And don't put this case in the same category as U.S. men's volleyball, which had a victory against Japan overturned. That mess reeked, but the U.S. player did misbehave.
Griffin did nothing wrong. He got a standing 8-count on his opponent, Rafael Lozano of Spain. Standing 8-counts mean an automatic point; Griffin got zero. He also clearly won on all five judges' scorecards (the operative method in 1988) and all five jury members' cards.
What's the catch? In order to activate the computer, enough judges must punch a button within one second of any point-scoring blows. Otherwise, the computer doesn't acknowledge anything. One judge in Griffin's bout was just coming off a two-day suspension because he had scored several fights 0-0. Various other judges here are brittle and feeble. For them to react in one second is too much to ask.
What we have here, then, is a fancy scoring system that isn't foolproof.
Joe Byrd, the U.S. head coach, defends the computer technology. It has worked well in American events, where judging is superior.
"It's an improvement over the past," Byrd said. "There's nothing wrong with the machine. They just need to educate the guys operating it."
Educate? Now? Isn't this a little late? Meanwhile the competition continues, just another irreparable glitch away from the next disaster.
One thing is certain: The residents of Pep Ventura, tired of being invaded by so many strangers and transport buses, can't wait to see Olympic boxing end.
It's hard to disagree with them.
