BADALONA, Spain - U.S.lightweight boxer Oscar De La Hoya raised his arms in triumph yesterday at the Joventut Pavilion, convinced he had done what was necessary.
But he couldn't becertain. Not after what happened to teammate Eric Griffin. Not with these judges. Not with this crazy scoring system.
He couldn't be certain of the outcome until the referee raised his arm.
"There was some doubt," the 19-year-old native of Los Angeles said.
This time, the glitch-marred electronic scoring system worked, relatively speaking anyway.
The hand of the 132-poundfighter was raised in victory as he earned a 16-7 decision over Bulgaria's Dimitrov Tontchev to advance to the semifinals with at least a bronze medal.
Yet De La Hoya did notescape the computer-spun madness. He did not know what to think after he peppered Tontchev's head with a series of jabs in the first round, and all he had to show for it was a 2-1 lead. He listened to coach Joe Byrd's instructions between rounds. Stick to the game plan, Byrd said. Work the left jab. Work the head.
De La Hoya looked over atthe five judges sitting at ringside. Although their faces change, collectively, they have become known as the five blind mice of the Barcelona Games.
To score a bout, theypress the key pads stationed at their side. The key pads are linked to a computer, which tabulates the scoring when three of the five judges press the key pads within one second.
Otherwise, the judges,when they are not taking sobriety tests, are only required to look vaguely alive, which perhaps explains why De La Hoya held only a 2-1 advantage after three minutes.
He thought it should havebeen 20-1 after he treated the Bulgarian's head like a punching bag. He had an unnerving thought at one point: Either the judges don't like Americans or they need new eye wear.
"Maybe they just droppedthe zero from the 20," De La Hoya said later, laughing. "I don't think they like Americans. The scoring has frustrated us. It does have us worried."
De La Hoya didn't feel much better after the second round when the scoreboard showed he was ahead by only 7-6.
"I figured I had to step up the pace," De La Hoya said. "I couldn't take any chances. It was too close."
He pressed the attack inthe third round. It wasn't pretty for Tontchev. The Bulgarian took one-two-three-four shots to the head, one barrage after the other.
"I knew who had won," DeLa Hoya said. "I knew inside. He was like a little bull, and I was the matador. He didn't really know what to do. They just aren't counting all the punches. I caught him with a left hook to the body one time, and it stopped him for a moment. But they aren't scoring body punches. You have to stick with the head."
Byrd has tried to easehis team's concerns with the scoring. He knows Griffin won, and he knows Griffin won easily, but his disgust has been recorded, and it is time to move forward, with seven of the team's 12 fighters still in the gold-medal hunt.
"There's nothing wrong with the machine {computer}," Byrd said. "They just need to educate the judges."
De La Hoya is the best ofthe remaining U.S. fighters. He used to train by jogging to his mother's grave in the wee hours of the morning. He stopped when it became too painful for him. She passed away two years ago with cancer.
"It started getting to me, so I had to quit," he said. "But that was my way of trying to stay close to her."
