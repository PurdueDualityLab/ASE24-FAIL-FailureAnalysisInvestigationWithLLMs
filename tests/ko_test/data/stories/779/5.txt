BADALONA, Spain -- Science lied yesterday.
Five judges watchingAmerican light flyweight Eric Griffin fight Spaniard Rafael Lozano in the second round of the XXVth Olympic Games boxing tournament yesterday said the gold medal favorite had advanced as expected into the quarterfinals. Three said he did it by a wide margin.
A computer said differently.
An Argentine judge saidGriffin won, 10-9. A Canadian judge said he won, 26-17. A Yugoslavian judge said he won, 18-9. A Pakistani judge said he won, 19-10. A Ghanian judge, who had been suspended the previous two days for twice scoring bouts 0-0, said he won, 8-5.
A computer said differently.
The computer lied.
What the computerinsisted, in the same stubborn way it insists you haven't paid last month's phone bill even when you have the canceled check in your hand, was that Eric Griffin was a 6-5 loser. And for the moment at least, that decision will stand, regardless of the opinion of the five men who actually watched the fight.
So a computer did what noamateur boxer in the past four years could do, wiping out all the painstaking efforts that had been focused on clearing Griffin's name the old-fashioned way, with sweat rather than lawyers, after he was tossed out of the 1988 US Box-offs when he tested positive for marijuana. The computer had eliminated him from a major boxing tournament.
But the computer lied.
"They stole the fightfrom me," Griffin said as he sat in his still-soaking USA boxing jersey and tried to fathom how a four-time world amateur champion had won and lost the same fight. It was the beginning of a long day in which two other Americans, bantamweight Sergio Reyes and welterweight Pepe Reilly, also lost, with only lightweight Oscar De La Hoya surviving.
"I came back from mysuspension for four whole years to get here so they could do this to me?" continued Griffin. "They put in this computer {scoring} after the problems in 1988 {at the Seoul Olympics when Roy Jones was ruled a loser to a Korean light middleweight in a fight he won in lopsided fashion} and got rid of the paperwork. But nothing has changed.
"This here is the worstdecision I ever got. I worked four years to get this opportunity to win a gold medal and this was my last shot. I figure they had it set up some kind of way before I stepped into the ring. I was up against the hometown boy. I'm sure there was some kind of jealousy against me. I think they've got something against the Americans."
Actually, after a review of the scorecards, it seemed more like some kind of computer glitch, but the result was the same. Elimination of a fighter. Destruction of a dream. Sorry about that.
But how, in the computerage, could such a thing happen? How could a computer fail at simple addition? How, you ask? The same way 10-year-olds batter their fathers at video arcades playing Super Mario and other Nintendo games.
It is all about reflexes.
Under the scoring system,at least two judges must hit a button that registers a scoring point within a second after the first judge does. If they do not, the point is not awarded by the main frame computer, even though each point will be recorded individually.
Hence, Griffin couldregister 81 individual points and end up with five on the scoreboard, while Lozano could be credited with 50 clean punches and end up with just six alongside his name at the end. This was baffling even to Griffin's longtime sponsor, computer company consultant Bob Jordan, who should know about such things.
"There's a lot of things Idon't understand," Jordan said. "I guess this has to happen once every four years to an American fighter. It's pretty tough to swallow."
It was so tough that USAteam manager C. "Buzz" Buzalsky and USA Boxing executive director Jim Fox filed a protest with the International Amateur Boxing Association within 60 seconds after the decision was announced to a raucous crowd of smiling Spaniards at the Pavello Club Joventut. Meanwhile, a small coterie of American supporters sat in stunned silence as their team's cocaptain and most likely gold medalist was defeated by a machine.
Backing it up were thescorecards, computer printouts and a videotape supplied by NBC showing, often in slow motion, at least six clean punches scored by Griffin in the fight's final nine seconds that apparently were not registered.
"This is the first appealto AIBA using the scoring system," Fox said. "The raw data indicates to us our kid won the fight. Everyone we talked to thinks our kid won. The judges all say he won. The flaw in the system is the reaction time of the judges, but the reality is that a tragedy occurred to an outstanding young American athlete."
Tragedy or not, there ismore to the Olympic Games than computerized scoring, and US coach Joe Byrd seemed to sense it even as his outrage over the decision parboiled his normally placid temperament. There is also politics, and once again, boxing finds itself in the middle of it this morning.
"I think that's just awaste of time," Byrd said of the protest, which will be ruled on today by the Referees and Judges Committee and IABA president Anway Chowdry. "It's opening up a can of worms. We gonna be like sitting ducks now.
"I couldn't believe thatlow scoring. He got one point in the second round when he landed a five-punch combination and got a standing 8 out of it. When I saw 3-2 {after two rounds}, I couldn't believe it. The guy wasn't scoring on Griff at all and they didn't give Griff anything."
Actually, they did, the computer just didn't notice.
"I knew we'd get a baddeal somewhere, but I thought it would be from a referee, not from the judges," Byrd said. "The crowd got to the judges. After two rounds, he asked me how he was standing and I said, `You ain't standin' too good.' I don't know anymore just what is a scoring blow."
Obviously, neither did the computer. Or at least it didn't know what addition was.
All it knew was a lie.
