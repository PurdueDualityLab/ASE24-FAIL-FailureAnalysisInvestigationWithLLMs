ONCE THE challenge of Juan Pablo Montoya had evaporated, Michael Schumacher waltzed majestically to the 59th win of his career in Montreal yesterday, his sixth of the 2002 season bringing Ferrari a record 150 triumphs.
Montoya had gone to the starting line with images in his head of losing the advantage of pole position in Monaco a fortnight ago due to a glitch with the BMW Williams' launch control software. But the Colombian made a perfect start from the premier position to beat Schumacher to the first corner, as Rubens Barrichello also made a strong getaway to ease out his team leader for second place. Montoya had no time to savour the lead however, for Barrichello outdragged him down the pit straight at the end of the first lap to take the initiative.
Deployment of the safety car on the 14th lap to clear away Jacques Villeneuve's stalled car, persuaded BMW Williams to gamble by bringing in Montoya immediately for a long refuelling stop. So after 15 laps it was a Ferrari one-two, with Montoya dropping back to fifth and rejoining just ahead of David Coulthard.
The safety car went back in at the end of the 17th lap. Immediately Montoya's fortunes looked rosier when both Raikkonen and Schumacher Jnr made mistakes in the final corner at the end of the 18th lap, allowing him to pounce dramatically on both as they ran three abreast to the first corner on the 19th lap, and move up to third place.
Barrichello's initial pace was confirmed as a light fuel load when he pitted for replenishment on the 26th lap, but his plan backfired as he dropped from the lead to sixth place. This was bad news for the Brazilian, who needed to avoid being bottled up behind anyone if his two-stop strategy was to pay off.
Schumacher, meanwhile, began piling on the pace in the lead, a series of fastest laps building him a 17secs gap over Montoya's fuel- heavy Williams. The world champion needed to build a big cushion in order to make his own stop and still get out of the pits ahead, just in case the Colombian was on a similar single-stop strategy.
By the halfway point Schumacher was 21secs ahead of Montoya, but neither Raikkonen, Ralf Schumacher nor Coulthard had pitted yet and Barrichello was still trapped and had lost 33.5secs to his team leader. At this stage it had become a two-horse race between Schumacher and Montoya.
Schumacher made his stop for fuel on the 38th lap, the Ferrari being stationary for 11.4secs. It was quick, but not fast enough for him to retain his lead over Montoya. Now the Colombian was the one going quickly, and the German the man with a fuel-heavy car. But Raikkonen's steadfast defence of third place had denied Williams the chance to use Ralf Schumacher as a buffer between his brother and Montoya. It would all come down now to just how well Montoya could eke out his fuel supply.
There were further fuel concerns for Williams when Ralf stopped on the 42nd lap, as a fuel hose feed problem kept him at a standstill for 21secs, dropping him from fourth to sixth place. Then he had to pit again a lap later to be refuelled from Montoya's rig. Now he was seventh, out of the points, and yet another stop was needed after another lap.
In the 49th lap Coulthard finally stopped for fuel, surrendering what had become third place to Barrichello, who was now only 15.7secs behind Montoya and five behind his team leader. Quick pit work by McLaren got the Scot out ahead of his partner, Raikkonen.
The answer to the Montoya conundrum came on the 51st lap as the Colombian dived into the pits for an 8.2secs stop, surrendering the lead to Schumacher and losing second place to Barrichello, who also pitted for fuel on the 54th lap.
The last threat to Schumacher disappeared when, for the second race running, Montoya rolled to a halt with a broken engine as he passed the pits to complete his 56th lap. Now the world champion nursed a 10secs lead over Coulthard, as Montoya walked calmly back to the pits waving to the appreciative crowd. 2002, assuredly, is not his year.
The closing stages were enlivened as the battling Coulthard and Barrichello closed on Schumacher in their duel for second. But Schumacher had everything under control. For a while it had seemed touch-and-go, but in the final analysis it was another straightforward success for the red steamroller.
With his 13th consecutive race finish in the points, Schumacher is fast approaching Carlos Reutemann's all-time record of 15 set in 1980-81. His latest victory was simply further confirmation that nothing is likely to stop him donning a record-equalling fifth World Championship crown long before this season of demonstration is over.
