MI C H A E L Schumacher yesterday triumphed for the fifth time at the Gilles Villeneuve circuit to deliver Ferrari's 150th Formula One victory.
Yet, it was Scotland's David Coulthard who was arguably the star of the show with another demonstration of his growing maturity.
Coulthard added an unexpected second place here in Canada to the amazing victory he enjoyed in Monaco a fortnight earlier.
His McLaren boss Ron Dennis, famed for his somewhat pompous 'Ronspeak', said: ' We optimised our performance.' What he should have said is that Coulthard grabbed his podium chance with a performance of grit, determination and assurance.
Coulthard said: 'I really didn't expect to be on the podium, but I made a good start and hung in there hoping to take advantage if any of our rivals had problems.
They did and I profited from them.' Both Williams-BMW drivers, Juan Pablo Montoya and Ralf Schumacher, had misfortunes and the challenge to the men in scarlet evaporated amid much frustration.
In the end, Schumacher had a comfortable run to the flag and extended his lead in the title chase to a formidable 43 points.
Even the German does not bother to argue too fiercely against the strength of his situation.
'Yes, we have a comfortable lead and we just have to make sure we do not slip up now, ' h e s a i d. ' B u t y o u cannot take anything for granted.
Something could happen to stop us but we have such a good package.' Indeed, they do. Ferrari are in a league of their own, which is why Coulthard's drive was so impressive.
To achieve results above and beyond your car's potential is a special talent and Dennis is happy to admit the Scot has that quality. He fought a tremendous late battle with thirdplaced Rubens Barrichello and kept the Ferrari No.2 at bay, even though rookie Japanese driver Takuma Sato got in their way.
Coulthard said: 'It was all a bit marginal but hopefully I didn't do anything wrong. It was a good fight between Rubens and myself.' Montoya defended his pole position slightly longer than he did at Monaco, but it was still for only a solitary lap.
At the end of the first circuit he was overtaken by the fast-charging Barrichello, who had edged in front of Schumacher at the beginning of the race.
Coulthard also made a flying start to go from ninth to sixth place, which he consolidated in the opening phase to put some pressure on Ralf Schumacher immediately ahead of him.
Jacques Villeneuve's jinx at his home race continued when he was back in the BAR garage twiddling his thumbs after a ninth-lap retirement from the middle of the pack, while Barrichello continued to dominate proceedings until the safety car was deployed on the 14th lap.
Ironically, it was to enable marshals to remove Villeneuve's car, which was stranded dangerously at the exit of a fast bend. By the time the cars were back at racing speed two laps later, Montoya was fifth, having made a pit-stop, and the two Ferraris led the field.
The Colombian soon powered his way back into third but found it tough to make ground until the Ferraris made their stops - Barrichello after 26 laps, Schumacher after 38.
Ralf Schumacher, last year's winner, went out of contention after a mid-race glitch with the refuelling rig in the Williams pit, while team-mate Montoya resumed his lead until his second pit-stop. He then suffered a 57th-lap breakdown.
The late battle for second place between Coulthard and Barrichello was thrilling, especially on the 60th lap when the Brazilian thought he had overtaken the Scot in the long, high-speed final straight, only to be beaten under braking with Sato in the way.
Coulthard had worked long and hard for his place and was not about to surrender it easily.
It was not a great day for the other British drivers, however, with Eddie Irvine ( Jaguar), Alan McNish (Toyota) and Jenson Button (Renault) all failing to finish after inauspicious races.
But they might as well begin the crowning ceremony for Michael Schumacher right now. With six victories from eight races, the man is invincible.
