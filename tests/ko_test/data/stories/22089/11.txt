SEVEN RACES into the least rewarding season of his career, David Coulthard has finally achieved the victory that he had had been expecting much sooner. The 31-year-old Scot went into 2002 anticipating launching a strong challenge for the World Championship. He was considered weak- willed when he conceded within three races that it was a hopeless task, but he was really only saying what others already knew to be true: the McLaren-Mercedes package was not going to be a match for Ferrari's F2002, especially when the red missile was being driven by a competitor as committed and focused as Michael Schumacher.
In six races Coulthard struggled, his morale reaching rock bottom, but as he prepares for another circuit that should favour his silver arrow this weekend, here on the Ile Notre Dame in Montreal, his motivation has been restored as he quietly basks in the glory won in Monaco.
"I don't know anybody who has the ability to see in the future," he said, "but certainly it was what we expected it to be, our best opportunity in the first half of the season because of the areas where we think we improved the car over last year. We had more downforce and it's only logical that if you hang all the wing on it around the streets of Monaco that that's going to help you." Montreal does not require so much downforce, and though it is another circuit on which overtaking is difficult, it is nowhere near as `impossible' as it is in Monaco.
Coulthard concedes that he may not be able to challenge for victory here, but the triumph in the Principality has raised spirits not just at McLaren and Michelin but also at Mercedes, which has been criticised a lot this season for its failure to match BMW and Ferrari power outputs. They run beyond 880bhp, whereas conventional wisdom suggests that the Mercedes V10, once the pacesetter, is lucky if it musters 850.
"Naturally," Coulthard suggests, "we wouldn't expect to be quite as strong around this circuit although we do have some improvements and we do have a little bit more horsepower for here. You never know, the tyres could be a big factor. There are a lot of straights here, you don't run a lot of downforce on this track. We're not exactly sure where our performance is going to be. We would be very surprised if we were on the front row but obviously that's going to be the goal."
The Monaco success finally exorcised the ghost of Coulthard's disastrous race there the previous year, where a software glitch on the formation lap put him from a brilliant pole position to the back row of the grid and consigned him to an embarrassingly long stint in the race following the rookie driver Enrique Bernoldi's Arrows before he finally mustered a disappointing fifth place. "I was watching the highlights, as I do before the races, of last year's race and all the frustration came flooding back to me so I should have fast-forwarded the start," he admits. "But it is just one race in your career."
This year's win also provided him with another timely boost as his inexperienced team-mate Kimi Raikkonen was beginning to overshadow him in both qualifying and races. In Monte Carlo the roles were reversed, as Raikkonen damaged his car early in practice and played second fiddle to the on-form Scot all weekend.
The success is helping Coulthard to come to terms with the disappointments he has suffered so far this season. "Your goal doesn't change, first of all. You still want to be quickest and you still want to win, so that is a constant. But your realistic expectations for the performance of the car vary with the circuit and ultimately you go out and try to give it 100 percent. The feel- good factor of being quick or quickest at a lot of the tracks obviously isn't there when you don't have the performance, but I don't think it really changes a great deal. The good thing is, having had the performance in the past with the team, then you know the key people are there to get the ingredients right for the future, and we just have to be patient." After Monaco, it's slightly easier to wait for the good times to roll again. Illustration
