The gap between Michael Schumacher and the rest is being closed down by the young Columbian, who is on pole in Montreal, says Richard Rae
WHISPER it, but the gap is narrowing. For the second race in succession, Michael Schumacher's Ferrari was comprehensively out-qualified by the Williams of Juan Pablo Montoya, setting up a potentially riveting Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal this afternoon.
It is a measure of how far both driver and car have come, because a year ago Montoya qualified 10th for this race before crashing out. This year, the "bumper-car boy from Bogota", as one Montreal newspaper has dubbed him, is a very different proposition.
"I am a lot more experienced, the team understands me a lot better and it just makes things easier," said the Colombian. "I feel happy with the car, and when you are comfortable pushing you go faster. I gave it a go and it was a pretty good lap, although it could have been faster. We should be competitive in the race, but we need a good start."
Two weeks ago in Monaco, Montoya had problems with his car's launch control system at the start and conceded the vital first corner to David Coulthard's McLaren. He had problems of a similar nature in Brazil and Austria, but while he will not want a repeat with Schumacher alongside, he is confident the team have sorted out the glitch.
Here's hoping. It is a relatively short distance from the grid into the first corner at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve and after the collisions between the two men in Malaysia and Brazil earlier in the season, Montoya is adamant he will not concede an inch. The start of the race at least will be unmissable, and the attritional nature of the circuit, a notorious car-breaker, suggests an eventful 70 laps of the Ile de Notre Dame.
Schumacher said he was reasonably content to be on the front row. "We didn't quite get it together, but we are always confident for the race, though it could be difficult to find a way past," he said. "The gap between the teams is obviously closing, as we always thought it would. There will be circuits where we may still have an advantage, but this track may favour them."
The second row also features a Williams-Ferrari combination, with Montoya's teammate Ralf Schumacher in fourth behind Rubens Barrichello.
Coulthard will start his McLaren Mercedes from the fourth row, alongside the Sauber of Nick Heidfeld. The Scot had been fastest during Friday practice, but his warning that it was not likely to be replicated in qualifying proved correct, as the Mercedes engine's deficit in straight-line power, masked by the twists and turns of Monaco two weeks ago, left him unable to match the pace of Ferrari and Williams.
He was also out-qualified, for the fifth time in eight races, by his young teammate Kimi Raikkonen and, for the first time this season, by the Jordan of Giancarlo Fisichella.
Cloudy skies ensured lower than expected air temperatures throughout the hour long session, which should have been good news for Ferrari, whose Bridgestone tyres tend to be more effective in cooler conditions. With rain a possibility, Williams sent their cars out early, Montoya immediately being 0.6sec faster than his teammate. The McLarens of Raikkonen and Coulthard were faster than Montoya in the first two sectors of the track, losing out on the long straight into the final corner.
Fisichella briefly put the Jordan into fourth, but now the red cars were on the track and making everything else look like a milk float. Schumacher took a second off Montoya's best, Barrichello six-tenths.
The gauntlet had been thrown down and Williams picked it up in breathtaking fashion. Montoya spectacularly gave it the works, using every inch of the track to record a superb 1min 12.836sec and claim pole by half a second. The grandstands rose. Ralf, just behind, slipped into second ahead of his brother by 0.03sec.
After a brief hiatus while the smoke billowing from the back of Takuma Sato's Jordan cleared, Michael came back out but could only split the Williams. Montoya sat tight in the garage, watching the German try again and fail by just under two-tenths of a second. Barrichello, having gone third, spun as the rain began to fall. Schumacher, already out on the circuit, felt the rain and abandoned his final flying lap.
Local hero Jacques Villeneuve will start eighth, BAR's much anticipated aerodynamic changes to their cars clearly an improvement. Both BAR and Jordan had also hoped to have a new and more powerful Honda engine available at a circuit where "grunt", as the pit-lane refers to horse-power, and stability under braking are the critical factors.
Unfortunately for both teams, testing last week at Silverstone revealed the new engine to be as yet insufficiently reliable to race.
On Friday, BAR had been quick enough to suggest the improvements to the car were significant, until Villeneuve, who is incapable of dissembling, revealed the cars were running on minimal fuel load "so it looks good". The 31-year-old Quebecois, whose £10m annual salary is second only to Schumacher's £18m, has a year left on a contract which specifies a £1m close-season rise, so he would have to take a substantial pay cut to have a chance of securing a more competitive drive elsewhere.
While Williams are clearly getting closer, Schumacher's 33-point lead still makes him a short odds favourite to retain his world championship. Next season looks as though it is going to be different story, and could be further affected by a meeting between the sport's governing body, the FIA, and team principals in London next Thursday.
On the agenda are further cost-cutting proposals, including restrictions on testing, a possible engine manufacturers' world championship, and the sharing of components.
However, having already reluctantly gone along with FIA president Max Mosley's proposal to restrict teams to a single engine per weekend from 2004, the big three of Ferrari, Williams and McLaren are unlikely to make any further concessions.
