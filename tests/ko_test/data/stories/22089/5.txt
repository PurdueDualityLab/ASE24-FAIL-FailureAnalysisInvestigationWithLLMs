Ralf Schumacher ends up fourth: Technical problem with Williams-BMW car does damage to his hopes of a repeat victory

Ralf Schumacher's hope of winning his second straight Air Canada Grand Prix suffered a serious dent yesterday as he could muster no better than fourth place in qualifying.
A technical problem with his Williams-BMW forced last year's winner into the spare car for most of the session, hampering his efforts at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve.
That leaves the German on the second row of the grid for today's start, with two Ferraris between him and teammate Juan Pablo Montoya on pole position.
'I wasn't very lucky,' Schumacher said afterward outside the team's trailers along the Olympic Basin. 'To be on pole is always nice. It makes things a little easier. But it wasn't possible today.'
BMW sporting director Gerhard Berger described the glitch as a 'pneumatic pressure problem.'
'Bad luck,' he summed up. 'He had a technical problem so he had to go in the T-car and he didn't have a chance to fight.
'But one car on first row, one car on second row - that's a good result.'
Schumacher also looked on the bright side, saying 'under these conditions, I must be happy with the second row.'
He posted a fastest lap of one minute, 13.301 seconds - just 0.465 seconds slower than Montoya.
Pole Position
'The T-car was set up for Juan, but I have managed to take the best out of it anyway,' Schumacher said. 'There was no way I could aim for pole position, though.'
And he did not rule out a repeat of last year's result, when he finished ahead of the Ferrari of his big brother Michael to win his first Canadian Grand Prix since entering Formula One in 1997.
'There's a very long race ahead of us; anything can happen,' Schumacher said.
'My target first is to come through the first few corners without any incidents and take it from there.'
But in the same breath, he suggested that - despite Montoya's dream starting position - the Ferraris will be hard to beat unless they are struck by some misfortune.
'It has always been very close in qualifying, and sometimes we have been even stronger. But in the race we have been more than a second away,' Schumacher said.
'So I would be surprised if there's a close fight. I rather expect Ferrari to be very strong in the race again.'
Schumacher sits second in the drivers' championship with 27 points, tied with his teammate and trailing his older brother by 33 points.
His only victory this season came at the Malaysian Grand Prix, the second stop on the 17-race calendar.
And he has yet to grab pole in 2002 - a feat the less experienced Montoya has achieved three times.
Schumacher insisted yesterday he is not worried about the internal rivalry, and he played down talk that he does not get along with his partner.
The truth, he said, is that the two are getting closer all the time.
'It's the same in every team - you try to be in front of your teammate. There's nothing unusual about it,' he said.
'I think Juan and myself get on better and better. We've always got on better than the press has said, actually. We respect each other more and more.
'Sure I would prefer to be on pole, but it wasn't possible. You have to admit that he did a good job and that's why he deserves it.
Second Season
'He had a very good day and a good car. It's always the same between the two of us. Sometimes he's going to be good, sometimes me.'
Montoya, in his second F-1 season, has yet to score a victory in 2002 - and Berger agreed he faces a struggle this afternoon despite starting from pole.
'It's a long race and Ferrari is very competitive,' he said. 'It's going to be very difficult.'
Still, he said he expects a better performance from his cars than at the last race in Monaco two weeks ago, when they struggled to keep up not only with Ferrari but also the lagging McLaren-Mercedes team.
'In Monte Carlo we were struggling a bit in the race on tire wear and we didn't set up the car in the best way,' Berger said. 'But we did some homework here, and we should be good for the race (today.)'
Both the Williams and McLaren teams use Michelin tires, which are generally thought to perform less well in cooler conditions than the Bridgestones used by rivals Ferrari.
Berger agreed that Montoya's result yesterday suggests Michelin rubber has made progress.
'It's not any more that sensitive for temperature,' he said. 'In hot weather, it still works a bit better - but not much of a difference.'
Michelin motorsport director Pierre Dupasquier said the common wisdom was wrong to begin with.
'I have always said that we are able to run competitively in warm or cool weather.'
