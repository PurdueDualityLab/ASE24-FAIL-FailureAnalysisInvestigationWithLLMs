Gateway Center officialssaid three office buildings damaged by flooding would remain closed today, but a city official said two were close to reopening.
One, Two and Three Gateway Center were to remain closed today, according to the Gateway Center Web site.
But Ron Graziano, chiefof the city Bureau of Building Inspection, said yesterday that tenants could be allowed into One and Two Gateway Center as soon as today if a fire alarm glitch is repaired.
Graziano said because of the amount of water damage to Three Gateway, it could be several days before it is reopened.
He said crews must evaluate the electrical system in Three Gateway to determine whether wires must be replaced or repaired.
The buildings aresuffering the lingering effects of a water main break that swamped their basements last Wednesday, forcing power to be shut off.
A boil-water advisory bythe Allegheny County Health Department has been lifted for all Gateway Center office buildings but remains in effect for the Gateway Towers condominium.
Holly Parada,communication coordinator for the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority, said the advisory will be lifted after the system has been flushed and samples tested.
Cynthia Ott, buildingmanager for Gateway Towers, said more than half of the 350 tenants and some businesses have moved back into the building.
She said most services have been restored, but they were still awaiting air-conditioning.
Ott said the city istemporarily hauling garbage from the premises because a trash compactor was submerged. The parking garage remains closed.
