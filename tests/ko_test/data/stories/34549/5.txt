Eight days after a 90-year-old water pipe unleashed millions of gallons of water into the basements of Gateway Center, businesses and firms will be allowed to return to two of the buildings this morning -- One and Two Gateway Center.
Despite a sliver of hope that a fire alarm glitch would be resolved, One, Two and Three Gateway Center remained closed yesterday.
Ron Graziano, chief of the city Bureau of Building Inspection, said the managers of One and Two Gateway received an all-clear from the Fire Bureau last night.
Gateway Towers residents remained under an advisory to boil water before consumption, and air conditioning had not yet been restored yesterday. Gateway Four was open, but air conditioning in the building was spotty.
During the past week, Gateway tenants have been escorted for 15- minute visits to their offices to check e-mail and conduct small amounts of business. That will continue at Three Gateway Center, which otherwise remains closed.
For businesses without multimillion-dollar clients or backup plans to cushion the impact of the disaster, the past week has been a lesson in how easily years of hard work could be washed away.
Last Wednesday, as Joe Ciniello cut a customer's hair in his 30- year-old barber's chair in the basement of Two Gateway Center, water gushed under his door and submerged the soles of his shoes. The customer in the chair got up with only one side of his hair cut, paid Ciniello and ran out.
Ciniello's Joseph Hair Styling -- a fixture for the past nine years in the basement of Two Gateway -- was inundated. Ciniello, without anything more elaborate than liability insurance, is struggling to come to grips with how he'll continue business.
The shop took on water that reached the seats of his four chairs.
Ciniello, who returned to turn off his barber's pole still twirling outside the shop six days after the flood, was going through a list of his 30 or so regular customers to earn some of the money he has lost in both time and equipment.
He has managed to salvage his four chairs and is renting a spot at Hair Fashions By Howard in a back room, where he will continue business. But it's back to square one for the 69-year-old barber. Illustration
