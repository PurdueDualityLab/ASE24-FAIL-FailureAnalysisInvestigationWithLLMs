"We also reviewed progress of 124 files that were applied earlier. The applicants were asked to comply with the required guidelines to get passports at the earliest," passport officer Padma Mahanti said. "To avoid last minute glitches, we have taken some advance measures so that the Haj applicants do not suffer. We would request police to expedite the verification of the applicants so that they do not miss the Haj pilgrimage," Mahanti added.
