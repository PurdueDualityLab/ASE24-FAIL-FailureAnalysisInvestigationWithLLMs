BHUBANESWAR: If the regional passport office (RPO), Bhubaneswar has its way, students would no longer need to stand in serpentine queues to apply for passports. The RPO has decided to organize a series of passport fairs in the city to make the registration process easier for students.
The first such fair is scheduled to be held here in April. 'We have not yet fixed the date. But it will surely be held in April. It will be the first of its kind fair in Bhubaneswar,' passport officer Padma Mahanti told TOI. Details would be chalked out about the number of applications to be received and passports distributed during the proposed fair.
On an average, the passport office receives around 300 applications (both general and Tatkal categories) everyday and distributes the same number of passports to applicants, everyday. One-third of these applications are received from students.
'The city has become an education hub. Everyday we notice hordes of young aspirants coming to apply for passports either for pursing higher study or doing jobs abroad,' Mahanti said.
Students expressed their gratitude at the RPO's 'target group' move. 'It will be a huge relief for us. Police personnel should also be present at the fair for speedy verification of applications,' Sambit Agarwal, an engineering student said.
'Since such fairs cannot be held everyday, the government should open more counters at the RPO to ease off the rush. It will be great if dedicated counters are opened for students and senior citizens,' Nirmal Mishra, another student, said.
RPO authorities said the passport registration and distribution system would be improved in next three months as the proposed Passport Seva Kendra (PSK) would be functional from June. The PSK that was to operate from the OCAC Tower would now function at the RPO building. Interior renovation is going on at the RPO to house the PSK.
Like students, the RPO also aims to help Haj pilgrims get passports quickly in June. Another passport fair for Haj pilgrims would be held here on March 25.
'To avoid last minute glitches, we have taken some advance measures so that the Haj applicants do not suffer,' Mahanti said.
