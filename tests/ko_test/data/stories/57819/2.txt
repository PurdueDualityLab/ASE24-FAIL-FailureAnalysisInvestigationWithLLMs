CHENNAI: Officials of the ministry of external affairs met in New Delhi met recently to discuss a possible glitch that has downed the online passport system, leaving thousands of applicants unable to get appointment dates.
Many applicants inChennai too, some with important commitments abroad, caught in the apparent computer malfunction, were unable to submit their documents at the three Passport Seva Kendras and the regional passport office in Shastri Bhavan.
Viswanathan K, who hasbeen trying to get an appointment for his son for the past week, said the appointment window opens at 4 pm but is filled within five minutes.
Officials say thesituation could have been caused by a technical problem that allows travel agents and touts to infiltrate the system and swamp it by quickly completing the nine stages of the online application before the general public can.
"Though the passport feeis only Rs 1,000, those who are not literate and who do not have internet access are shelling out close to Rs 3,000 to agents to get an online appointment," an official said. Top officials in the RPO admit that there is a glitch in the system and said they have been informed about the problem.
The ambitious Rs 1,000 crore project by Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) wasintended to make the process of applying for a passport easier, but it has made it even harder to get an appointment at the passport offices than before, said a source.
"Why don't they simplyrevert to the old system where at least one is assured of an appointment either a week or a month later?" asked an applicant. "With this system it appears to be impossible to get a date. If the government has spent Rs 1,000 crore of taxpayers' money then I suppose it should be answerable to applicants," said Dominic Natarajan, who has been running from pillar to post get an appointment as he has to go abroad on an assignment.
Regional passport officer(Chennai) C Senthil Pandian said the ministry of external affairs has instructed its offices to attend to applicants who are not able to get appointments online. "We already have a system in place where 10 categories of applicants can walk into the Passport Seva Kendra offices in Tambaram," he said.
When contacted, TCS officials declined to comment on the issue.
