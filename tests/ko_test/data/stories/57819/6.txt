KOLKATA: The external affairs ministry introduced Passport Seva Kendras (PSK) for quick and glitch-free issuance of passports , but the shift to this new system has not come tailor-made . It's not a one-off case that citizens in Kolkata are facing problems in getting seamless services. Even the PSKs in Bangalore and Hyderabad took almost a year to iron out all the problems, which include internal goofups and tackling the touts.
"There were a lot of teething problems when the PSK project was initiated. Since this was a new initiative, we tried out various ways. Some compounded problems instead of solving them. For instance, people queued up all night and then sold the spot to applicants in the morning at a premium . While this may have been the practice in the old system, we could not allow this to continue," reminisced Golok Kumar Simli, the principal consultant and chief technology officer and one of the architects of the project.
The bandwidth problem, too, had cropped up at the initial stage, forcing those engaged in the project to try out various measures and then hastily make course corrections. When appointment dates were opened up without restriction, all slots got filled for three months. When officials tried out a new system of allowing only specified number of applicants to fill up the form so that they could all get appointments, travel agencies and cybercafs with high bandwidth began controlling the process.
"It is after a lot of trial that we arrived at the present system. This may not be the most perfect one in a situation where demand outstrips supply by a huge margin , but it is the closest we could get to," Simli explained.
All PSK centres faced some common troubles, including time for passport officers and staff to migrate from an antiquated manual system to an IT-enabled modern system. In Kolkata, that time took slightly longer. The second problem was the absence of adequate number of granting officers. In Kolkata, there are just 13 granting officers, including regional passport officers and assistant regional passport officers. Of these, seven officers are deputed at the PSK though it has a capacity for 10.
"If the officer count increases and 10 persons are allotted to the PSK, we can process twice the number of daily slots from 850 to 1,600-1 ,700 applications," said regional passport officer R Sivakumar.
The other major problem is that Kolkata has the only PSK in the state. Once the Behrampore PSK opens mid-April , around 400 daily applicants from Behrampore, Nadia, Birbhum and North Dinajpur and South Dinajpur will apply there, reducing the load on Kolkata. Thereafter, focus will shift on mini-PSKs that will have a daily processing capacity of around 150 applications.
"We plan to set up mini-PSKs in Siliguri , Kharagpur, Gangtok and Agartala. That will take a huge load off Kolkata. Another mini-PSK is proposed at the Brabourne Road office. Then a citizen can expect to get a passport within a month of application," said Muktesh K Pardeshi, joint secretary & chief passport officer at external affairs ministry.

In the past, the process of issuing passports was extremely opaque. The mystery that shrouded the process also bred corruption. Passport Seva Kendras have made the process transparent. But they have led to new problems with applicants from rural areas facing the digital challenge and others unable to get appointments online. Also, the verification process still lacks transparency. Not only is there a need for more PSKs in Kolkata and rest of Bengal, village-level kiosks are critical to empower people to obtain a passport. The verification system needs to be streamlined so that passports can be issued within a month.
