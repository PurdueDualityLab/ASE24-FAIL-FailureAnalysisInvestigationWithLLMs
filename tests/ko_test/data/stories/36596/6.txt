Wheeler keeps Academic Decathlon crown after scoring glitch is overcome: [West Bay Edition]

The Rhode Island Academic Decathlon has crowned a champion - again.
Fortunately, it's the same high school -- The Wheeler School, in Providence -- that was declared the winner when the event was held more than a week ago, and before a computer glitch called the final scores into question and forced a full rescoring.
Wheeler, now the winner of 17 of the 23 Academic Decathlons held in Rhode Island, will move on to the national competition in San Antonio, Texas, late next month.
While Wheeler remained on top, the rest of the 23-team field shifted beneath it: Narragansett High School jumped from 11th to 8th, Johnston from 5th to 3rd, and Middletown from 21st to 18th, when comparing their new scores with those received on March 5.
At the same time, scores changed dramatically in the individual events. Decathlon officials decided not to take back any medals from students who were mistakenly declared winners last Sunday. Instead they are minting and awarding new medals to the actual winners. That means awarding at least 45 more medals.
Rhode Island Decathlon President John Howell, the publisher of the Warwick Beacon, said that the problem lay in the software handed down by the national Academic Decathlon. It gave numerous students scores of zero out of 1,000 points on their essay questions, and under-scored portions of the arts and the language-and-literature sections.
Seeing the zeroes show up on their score sheets, several team coaches pointed it out to officials. The medals had already been awarded, but decathlon officials called for a full rescoring, and sought the source of the problem.
Unknown to them, several other states were experiencing the same problem, due to a flaw in the scoring software distributed by the national decathlon.
Late last week, the national organization sent a corrected version of the software, and the local officials spent Thursday through Saturday rescoring the competition.
"They sent us an updated version of the program. I suspect they updated it as soon as we brought it to their attention," Howell said.
The error was a pricey one for the local organization -- getting a technician to check the scanner that reads the documents for errors cost $500, and minting new medals for the award winners will cost close to $500.
Officials from the schools involved said they didn't care who won in the end; the competition and the achievement are what matters, said Wheeler Headmaster Daniel Miller, not who goes to San Antonio.
Cranston High School West Principal Edward Lemoi, whose team dropped from fourth to sixth place after the rescoring, said that he was so impressed with the tenacity displayed by his students that it reminded him of watching some of the more physical sports -- particularly, the Cranston West wrestlers he used to coach.
"They competed with the same ferocity as some of my wrestlers."
Howell said that the additional medals will be presented at a ceremony at the State House in May. Next year, he said, the local organization will be much more vigilant about checking its score sheets before handing out awards, and will put the scoring system through test runs before the actual event.
"That's our credibility. If we don't have good scores, what's the point of the competition?" Howell said. "We don't want to have this happen again next year. We'll be more thorough in printing out all the reports that we need."
The decathlon tests students in 10 categories: art, economics, essay, interview, language and literature, mathematics, music, science, social science and speech.
