WARWICK - It's a scoring controversy to rival the judging debates at the Olympics, or the pileups at the end of nearly every college football season: who is the real winner of this year's Rhode Island Academic Decathlon for high school students?
Is it Wheeler School, the perennial champion, and the team that was given the first-place medal after the event Sunday night? Is it second-place Bishop Hendricken? Third-place St. George's School? Or even a team as low as eighth place?
Right now, it's all up in the air. Just after the annual competition at the Community College of Rhode Island, in Warwick, was over and the medals had been awarded, decathlon officials discovered a series of errors in their scoring system, serious enough to alter the results of the competition.
"In theory, someone right now in eighth place could wind up in first," said John Howell, president and founder of the Rhode Island decathlon.
"This is not what you would expect -- but in any event, it's happened," he said.
The outcome matters for more than pride; the winning nine-person team gets an all-expenses-paid trip to the national competition in San Antonio late next month.
Now, students from the schools in contention are biting their nails waiting to hear if they will suddenly find themselves winners - - or losers.
"They're curious, very curious," said Deborah Foppert, a history teacher at St. George's, in Newport, and the coach of the current third-place team. "They're real curious about what's going to happen -- they check in with me once in a while, they want to know if I've heard anything."
The problem is either in the computer system that the national Academic Decathlon gives to the state competitions each year, or with the scanner that processed the students' scoring sheets.
After the medals had been awarded, organizers noticed that on some of the individual scoring sheets, several students had received 0 out of 1,000 points on their essay questions -- possible, but extremely unlikely.
Officials checked some of the other scores, and talked with coaches from some of the 23 schools in the competition, who said there were surprising figures all over the scoring sheets: their best art student scoring 80 out of 1,000 on the arts portion? Again, possible, but unlikely. The more they looked, the more zeroes and improbably low scores they found.
"Then we said, something is ka-fooey here," Howell said.
The problem is probably with the scanner and its ability to read one section of the scoring sheets, Howell said, and so the scores will probably not change dramatically. But with the teams so close, if one picks up 100 points and another loses that much, then the overall results could change.
The current tallies have Wheeler in the lead with 28,679 points, followed closely by Hendricken with 28,088 and St. George's with 28,059. Cranston High School West and Johnston High School are slightly farther back at roughly 27,750 each.
As of Tuesday, Howell said that the organizers have decided to rescore the entire competition, after the computer program and the scanner are checked by their manufacturers to determine where the problem lies. It is not known how soon they will be able to start the process.
If the scoring problems remain after both the scanner and the computer system have been checked, the organizers will rescore the competition by hand -- an arduous process when dealing with 261 students from 23 schools, competing in 10 categories.
If the scores change in the individual scoring categories, students who won will not be stripped of their medals. Howell said, however, additional medals may be awarded to the "new" winners.
Wheeler has won 16 of the previous 22 decathlons. The school's Web site, in fact, lists them as having now won 17 of 23.
The decathlon tests students in 10 categories: art, economics, essay, interview, language and literature, mathematics, music, science, social science and speech.
