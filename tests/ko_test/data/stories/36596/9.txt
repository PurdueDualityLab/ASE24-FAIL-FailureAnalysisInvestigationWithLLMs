WARWICK - It appears that The Wheeler School, in Providence, was the winner of the Rhode Island Academic Decathlon yesterday -- keeping the title this school has won 17 times in the competition's 23 years, and has held since 1998.
But after the winners were announced and the medals given out, a glitch was discovered in the computer tallies, said John Howell, of the state Academic Decathlon.
Some essay scores weren't counted, which could affect the outcome of how the teams and individual students placed, he said. The scores were close, with Wheeler, Bishop Hendricken and St. George's in the lead. The remaining top-scoring schools were Cranston West, Johnston High, Warwick Veterans team one, South Kingstown High, Narragansett High, East Greenwich High, and Classical High, of Providence.
For the Super Quiz, St. George's placed first, followed by Pilgrim High School, and Warwick Veterans High School team one in third place. The overall student winners were:
Benjamin Strom-Weber, from Wheeler School, in the varsity division; William Dilauro, Warwick Veterans High School team one, in the scholastic division; and Christopher Gage, Bishop Hendricken High School, for the honor division.
The final tallies are expected today. Meanwhile, The Wheeler School coach and students celebrated their school's big win -- and the upcoming competition at the U.S. Academic Decathlon next month in San Antonio, Texas.
"The students really took control of this team and led their way through the subject," said new Wheeler coach John Campbell. "This is the result of great student leadership."
The Academic Decathlon, founded in 1981, is a scholastic competition that tests students in 10 categories: art, economics, essay, interview, language and literature, mathematics, music, science, social science, and speech.
The crowd watching in the auditorium at the Community College of Rhode Island whooped for the scores like the teams were shooting baskets instead of nailing down critical and sometimes obscure facts.
On the floor, where the academic athletes competed from desks facing the questions projected on a big screen, Classical High School displayed a bouquet of purple balloons, the school's color. Narragansett High School's team kept trading off a large, pink sombrero. Every time a Pilgrim High School student got the answer right, he or she waved a yellow pompon at the crowd.
