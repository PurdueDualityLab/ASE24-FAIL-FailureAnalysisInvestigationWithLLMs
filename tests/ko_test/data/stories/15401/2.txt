Net access providers to move past traditional dial-up access for traditional PCs.

What's a 21st century Internet service provider to do?
Stocks in traditional ISPs, such as Atlanta-based EarthLink, are hovering near all-time lows as Wall Street's love affair with the traditional dial-up ISP begins to wane. Investors are demanding more products and services and evidence of additional revenue streams from high-speed access, Web hosting, advertising and electronic commerce.
Meanwhile, the Microsoft Network (commonly known as MSN and soon to be renamed Microsoft.net), which had been practically written off as an afterthought of the software giant, is rolling out a new product strategy this week in New York designed to highlight the company's Web-based content across a variety of platforms and devices.
At the same time, the days when Internet access was limited to those who had access to a computer and a dial-up telephone connection rapidly are disappearing.
Cell phones, pagers, personal digital assistants such as the Palm Pilot and other devices _ including your television set _ all allow users to connect to the Web.
This doesn't mean PC Internet access is going to be replaced by cell phones or other space-age devices.
It does mean that ISPs such as EarthLink will have to do more than offer a reliable connection to the Web from a desktop PC.
Jupiter Communications analyst Dylan Brooks says the recent downturn in ISP stocks is an indicator that Wall Street wants to see more from access providers than just millions of dial-up customers. Brooks says that to stay competitive in a rapidly changing marketplace, these ISPs have to start thinking about ways to keep their dial-up subscribers loyal as other access devices move into the mainstream.
'You are hard-pressed to find an ISP that doesn't recognize the need to smarten up its pipes,' he says. 'They know they need to derive more of their revenue from non-access charges, including paid content, Web hosting, advertising and commerce. The value placed on those revenue streams is higher than those placed on access revenue alone. The ISPs valued most highly have significant application plays and content revenue.'
EarthLink has blamed its stock slide on the downturn of the entire Internet sector. It also has aggressively begun to advertise and roll out high-speed broadband services. (The company topped the 100,000 high-speed user mark last week). It has increased its offerings to its small-business Web-hosting customers to prove it can generate alternative revenue sources.
However, despite the best efforts, the stock continues to stumble, and EarthLink has little choice but to stand by its 'connectivity is king' strategy.
Meanwhile, the Microsoft Network continues to focus on the design and development of its Web sites such as CarPoint, HotMail, HomeAdvisor and MSN Search. The company has been sending mixed signals to analysts with an Internet strategy that focuses on content, a computer rebate program that focuses on access and a wireless strategy that seems unrelated to any of its other Internet plays. Company spokesman say that this week it will announce a new, unified strategy that will tie the disparate pieces of the Microsoft.net puzzle together. Microsoft also promises that the services will be built to deliver the company's content over a variety of platforms, not just the Windows PC.
While America Online and Microsoft still say access is important, the slight shift of focus to content gives each an edge over companies like EarthLink, which built its reputation and its subscriber base of more than 4 million on outstanding service and support.
However, it's much too soon to count anybody out, including EarthLink. The service-based ISP earlier this year ended its TV commercials with the tagline: 'It's your Internet, we just connect you to it.' In the future, what EarthLink or any other ISP connects you to may be just as important as how fast and how well it connects you. Microsoft is banking on content; EarthLink is banking on a strong infrastructure to make sure users get to the content they want.
EarthLink's strategy is to hang on to its dial-up users it has already won over with its service-based model by assuring them that, as new technologies develop, the company will be there to make sure every problem is solved, every glitch fixed and every question answered.
Company President Mike McQuary says EarthLink will hold to the same high standards of service for users of emerging technologies it has always had for its PC dial-up customers.
'We already know who you are,' says EarthLink Chief Executive Garry Betty. ' And if you want to configure your phone to access your EarthLink personal start page, we'll be there to deliver to you the content you already access and are already using.'
'Because of our core competencies, we have many potential partners who want to work with us,' McQuary says. 'But we won't roll out any new service until it's ready. It's important to us to maintain trust with our subscribers. We have to make sure that when we roll out something to our customer base, we can service them and give them the help they need. '
While EarthLink continues to focus on connectivity, AOL, the nation's largest ISP with more than 23 million members, is immersed in its 'AOL Anywhere' strategy. AOL is in a better position because it can offer a staggering amount of content, a huge number of subscribers and a merger with Time Warner that will provide it with virtually instant broadband access. The company already is providing users with access to several wireless devices, Web-based mail and even AOL TV.
AOL users who enter the keyword 'AOLanywhere' will find not just a listing of the wireless products that can be used to access the service, but a buyers guide. College students also will find out how to get their AOL mail via the company's Web site (www.aol.com). Information about AOL's TV offering can be found at the keyword 'AOLTV.'
'Now people really understand the value of AOL,' says AOL's Marta Grutka, who works with the product development team. 'Our members have really come to understand how we can enrich their lives with our content. We can tell them they can send (instant messages) while they are watching 'Friends' or get e- mail from their cell phones.'
AOL knows that its mail, news, stock, shopping and other services are vital to users, but it's no longer for information that users need AOL. Like EarthLink, it is counting on the loyalty _ as well as the inertia factor _ to migrate users to a variety of devices.
'AOL has always been platform and access agnostic,' Grutka says. 'We want to let consumers and AOL members access their favorite features and services no matter where they are or how they connect or at what speed.'
