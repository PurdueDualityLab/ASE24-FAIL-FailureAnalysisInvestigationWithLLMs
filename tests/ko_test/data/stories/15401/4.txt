What's a 21st century Internet service provider to do?
Stocks in traditional ISPs, such as EarthLink, are hovering near all-time lows as Wall Street's love affair with the traditional dial-up ISP begins to wane.
Investors are demanding more products and services and evidence of additional revenue streams from high-speed access, Web hosting, advertising and electronic commerce.
Meanwhile, the Microsoft Network (commonly known as MSN and soon to be renamed Microsoft.net), which had been practically written off as an afterthought of the software giant, is rolling out a product strategy designed to highlight the company's Web-based content across a variety of platforms and devices.
At the same time, the days when Internet access was limited to those who had access to a computer and a dial-up telephone connection are rapidly disappearing.
Cell phones, pagers, personal digital assistants such as the Palm Pilot and other devices - including your television set - all allow users to connect to the Web.
This doesn't mean PC Internet access is going to be replaced by cell phones or other space-age devices.
It does mean that ISPs such as Atlanta-based EarthLink will have to do more than offer a reliable connection to the Web from a desktop PC.
Jupiter Communications analyst Dylan Brooks says the recent downturn in ISP stocks is an indicator that Wall Street wants to see more from access providers than just millions of dial-up customers. Brooks says that to stay competitive in a rapidly changing marketplace, these ISPs have to start thinking about ways to keep their dial-up subscribers loyal as other access devices move into the mainstream.
'You are hard-pressed to find an ISP that doesn't recognize the need to smarten up its pipes,' he says. 'They know they need to derive more of their revenue from non-access charges, including paid content, Web hosting, advertising and commerce. The value placed on those revenue streams is higher than those placed on access revenue alone. The ISPs valued most highly have significant application plays and content revenue.'
EarthLink has blamed its stock slide on the downturn of the entire Internet sector. It also has aggressively begun to advertise and roll out high-speed broadband services. (The company topped the 100,000 high-speed user mark last month). It has increased its offerings to its small-business Web-hosting customers to prove it can generate alternative revenue sources.
However, despite the best efforts, the stock continues to stumble, and EarthLink has little choice but to stand by its 'connectivity is king' strategy.
Meanwhile, the Microsoft Network continues to focus on the design and development of its Web sites such as CarPoint, HotMail, HomeAdvisor and MSN Search. The company has been sending mixed signals to analysts with an Internet strategy that focuses on content, a computer rebate program that focuses on access and a wireless strategy that seems unrelated to any of its other Internet plays.
MSN announced new software last week in its latest bid to capture customers from AOL. The software is a test version of the MSN Explorer, which can be downloaded onto a computer for free, and works like a browser.
Later this fall, the software will be distributed on disks. MSN Explorer is part of a promised revamp of the entire Microsoft online business. The company also plans to offer high-speed Internet access by the end of the year.
While America Online and Microsoft still say access is important, the slight shift of focus to content gives each an edge over companies such as EarthLink, which built its reputation and its subscriber base of more than 4 million on service and support.
However, it's much too soon to count anybody out, including EarthLink. The service-based ISP earlier this year ended its TV commercials with the tag line: 'It's your Internet, we just connect you to it.'
In the future, what EarthLink or any other ISP connects you to may be just as important as how fast and how well it connects you. Microsoft is banking on content; EarthLink is banking on a strong infrastructure to make sure users get to the content they want.
EarthLink's strategy is to hang on to the dial-up users it has already won over with its service-based model by assuring them that, as new technologies develop, the company will be there to make sure every problem is solved, every glitch fixed and every question answered.
Company president Mike McQuary says EarthLink will hold to the same high standards of service for users of emerging technologies it has always had for its PC dial-up customers.
'We already know who you are,' Garry Betty, EarthLink's chief executive officer, says. 'And if you want to configure your phone to access your EarthLink personal start page, we'll be there to deliver to you the content you already access and are already using.'
