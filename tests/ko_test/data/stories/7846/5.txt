As a foster-child placement agency, All About Kids grew up in a hurry.
It was formed in 1997 byJudith Malin, who had worked for six months at a private foster agency when she decided to create a competing business. Weeks after she got her state license, the agency she left alleged she was using its records to lure away foster parents.
In the ensuing months,the state Division of Child Welfare Services learned All About Kids' child-placement supervisor lacked the required experience and threatened action against its license for allegedly soliciting foster homes and their children from four existing programs.
But after foster parents came to the agency's defense, the state dropped its investigation.
That might have ended AllAbout Kids' regulatory troubles, except that it placed four foster children with a couple who have criminal arrest records and a history of resigning from other foster care agencies. And one of those children, 2 1/2-year-old Miguel Arias- Baca, was beaten to death earlier this month.
This week, as Westminsterpolice prepare to ask prosecutors to file a murder charge against foster father Ricky Haney, Colorado legislators are re-examining a child protection system that increasingly relies on private agencies to find foster homes. Agencies' role crucial
These agencies play acrucial role in the state foster care system, taking thousands of abused and neglected children that counties cannot place in their government-licensed homes. But critics of privatized foster care also see tragic exceptions to a system that is supposed to be all about kids.
Too often, they say, it's all about money.
"What you have are anumber of modest-sized operators, some of whom are very well run and very well motivated, some of whom are poorly run and motivated by greed and advantage taking," said David Littman, a lawyer who serves as a guardian to foster children.
"The advantage is beingtaken of significantly neglected and abused children to make a living - and sometimes a very, very handsome living - at their expense."
Colorado has an unusualtwo-tiered foster care system. Some foster children go to county homes, which are licensed and regulated by 63 separate counties. Others go to private child-placement agencies, which are licensed by the state but allowed to certify their own foster homes.
All foster parents mustbe fingerprinted, checked against a child- abuse registry and provide three references. They also must pass a home inspection and a "family assessment" of their suitability conducted by either a private agency or a county.
Examine the inner workings of this system, and puzzling discrepancies appear.
*State records showColorado is paying an average of three times as much for children placed with private foster care agencies as it does to county foster homes. Of the $27 million spent for foster care so far this fiscal year, $21 million went to private agencies placing just over half the foster children.
*County officials saythey have forced families to surrender foster care licenses only to discover the same families have been certified by a private agency - and there's nothing they can do but complain to the state.
*Foster care costs andpractices vary widely from county to county. Pueblo, for example, spends almost twice as much for each child placed outside the home as Boulder. The reason? Pueblo sends 95 percent of its foster children to private agencies, while Boulder places 90 percent of its foster children in county homes.
*Staff support for fosterparents varies greatly among private placement agencies. In Denver, Lutheran Family Services employs 11 people to provide 24-hour-a-day support to 40 foster children. Crayon Academy, another Denver placement agency, had its license suspended recently after a foster parent called for help with a boy threatening suicide - and couldn't find a single staff person.
*Payments for foster carecan range from less than $400 to more than $2,000 a month, depending on the therapeutic needs of the child. Yet placement agencies say they know of no state regulations to distinguish the qualifications of "therapeutic" foster parents from other foster parents.
*Colorado foster parentsare registered with the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, which is supposed to notify the agency employing them of any arrest. In separate errors - one computer, one human - the bureau failed to notify the foster care system when Ricky Haney was arrested in 1997 and E'von Haney in 1998. A difficult challenge People who become foster parents accept a terrible, sometimes terrifying, responsibility. Few of the children entering the Colorado system are healthy. Foster parents may be asked to take a child who starts fires, or threatens suicide, or is fed from a gastrointestinal tube, or handles the trauma of childhood sexual abuse by smearing feces on walls.
By all accounts, even the toddlers coming into this system are getting tougher.
Liz Shackford, theprogram coordinator at Lutheran Family Services in Denver, was horrified to see a 3-year-old foster child squish a baby's hand, calmly and deliberately, with a rocking chair. "We're getting kids who are 2 years old who are showing signs of severe aggression. And it's scary," she said.
The compensation fortaking a foster child in Colorado historically has been meager. Until a year ago, the state government limited county home payments per child to $359 a month - less than a dollar an hour for round-the-clock care. Today's rate averages about $510 a month.
At the same time, thestate negotiated contracts with private foster care placement agencies whose rates range to $2,000 or more a month. The higher rates went to care for children with special medical or emotional needs. Parents in these "therapeutic" foster homes could take as many as four children and earn closer to $1,000 a month per child.
In effect, the statecreated a system that drove foster parents who were found and trained by county agencies into an expanding private foster care network.
And who can blame them,asked John Ozzello, the county social services director in Lake County. "If you were a foster parent and I said I can pay you $359 a month, and some guy came to you from a child-placement agency and said I can pay you $700 to $800 a month, what would you do?" Small beginnings
Colorado's private fostercare network started small in the 1970s with a few agencies such as Jefferson County-based Synthesis, which offered to care for disturbed and handicapped children previously confined in institutions.
The network grew quickly.By 1986, Colorado had licensed 49 private foster care and adoption agencies. It had 59 in 1990, 86 in 1995. Today there are 104.
Placement agencydirectors and their foster parents say Colorado children have gained much from this network. It provides homes to children with severe medical or emotional problems. It offsets the higher cost of care by providing caseworkers, therapists and other services that otherwise would be left to the county.
At Synthesis, now a largeand respected placement agency, a 24- person staff oversees 140 children in 53 foster homes and two group homes. "Our caseworkers carry a smaller caseload than the county departments," said Pam Hoggins, its executive director.
Yet some who providelegal, social and adoption services to Colorado children say that in many cases they can find little difference in quality between county foster homes and the therapeutic foster homes of private agencies that charge three times as much for a placement.
Neither could a 1998state audit. "We did not see measurable differences, in outcomes or services" between county and private foster homes, said deputy state auditor Joanne Hill. "There was no underlying basis for the differences in cost."
In some cases, fosterparents deemed unfit by county agencies become foster parents at private placement agencies. "We've only had three situations where that's happened in the last year and a half," said William Baird, Larimer County's child welfare director, "but it's three too many as far as I'm concerned."
Baird recently visited afourth home to investigate an allegation of child abuse. While the complaint was not substantiated, he found the foster parents had such worrisome "family and mental health problems that I just questioned how they could be caring for other people's children."
Because the home wascertified by a state-licensed private placement agency, there was little he could do. "We registered our concerns," he said.
Placement agencies alsolearn sometimes that foster parents they deem unsuitable for such challenging work turn up at other agencies.
Pam Hoggins particularlyremembers a couple who resigned after she decided Synthesis would no longer use their foster home: Ricky and E'von Haney. She took it hard when a child placed by another agency was beaten to death in their home.
"I have a grandson 2 1/2 years old, and this made me sick," she said.
Hoggins would not explain why she forced the Haneys to leave, but said she forwarded all of her records about them to police.
She wishes Colorado had abetter system for tracking foster parents who hop from home to home. She has learned the Haneys had worked for two child-placement agencies after leaving Synthesis, "and we never, ever had a request for their records from anybody."
She also wonders whathappened to the notification system that is supposed to inform the Division of Child Welfare Services whenever a foster parent is arrested.
Ricky Haney was arrestedin 1997 for drunken driving and driving without a license. He later pleaded guilty to a reduced charge. E'von was arrested in December on a felony theft charge, suspected of stealing $3,000 from an after-school program she supervised. That case is unresolved.
The Colorado Bureau ofInvestigation admits it failed to notify the state and the placement agency, All About Kids, of either arrest. In E'von's case, the computer system flagged her as a foster parent, but the operator did not forward that information to anyone.
In Ricky's case, a computer "glitch,"discovered after he became a murder suspect, improperly coded his arrest as noncriminal. "That has since been corrected," said Robert Sexton, head of the bureau's crime information center.
The Haney case has alsobrought a legislative proposal from state Sen. Doug Linkhart, a Denver Democrat who wants child-placement agencies to conduct more extensive background checks of prospective foster parents.
According to Westminsterpolice, the fatal beating was not the first time Miguel had suffered abuse in the Haney home. The examination of his dead body found "bruises that appeared to be healing," spokeswoman Jacki Tallman said.
The three other childrenwho were in the Haneys' care - including Miguel's younger brother - have been removed from the home. The Haneys' only income source was caring for foster kids.
Division of Child WelfareServices records contain no evidence that the state worried about the safety of children placed by All About Kids, now based in Littleton. Government officials were concerned, however, about the qualifications of its child-placement supervisor, Allison Colalancia, and about its allegedly aggressive recruitment of foster parents and children from other programs.
In March 1997, a monthafter All About Kids was licensed, a complaint was lodged against its director, Judith Malin, and against Colalancia by the child-placement agency they left, Children's Network. It alleged that "foster home record information was taken from Children's Network by these staff members" and they "arranged for three foster homes to leave Children's Network and come to their new agency."
A month later, the statefound that Colalancia lacked the child- placement experience its standards required. It waived the standard, asking instead that someone with a master's degree in social work supervise her for a year, a requirement she fulfilled.
In August 1997, alicensing supervisor notified All About Kids it was under investigation. Her letter accused All About Kids of improperly soliciting foster parents from four programs and stated that other agencies "found that it was difficult to continue a positive working relationship" with parents denied permission to transfer.
All About Kids respondedwith numerous letters from foster parents praising the prompt and cheerful support that Malin and Colalancia provided. The state dropped the investigation in December 1997.
Child welfare officialsremoved three foster children from the Haney home after Miguel died Feb. 2, but have taken no action so far against All About Kids' license. Colorado Department of Human Services spokesman Dwight Eisnach said 42 foster children remain in 13 All About Kids foster homes, or slightly more than three foster children per home.
Malin, All About Kids' director, and her lawyer declined to comment for this story.
According to DanaAndrews, the supervisor of child care licensing in Colorado, only one child-placement agency has ever had its license suspended.
That happened in December, after a suicide attempt in an Aurora foster home. State records give this account:
The foster father, ManuelMontoya, called 911 after a boy in his home attacked other children. The boy pulled a knife, then tried to kill himself. When Aurora police arrived, they refused to take the boy to the Denver Family Crisis Center because it was outside their jurisdiction. Fearing the boy would jump from the car, Montoya also declined to take him. He called Mitzi Kennedy, the executive director and placement supervisor for Crayon Academy. She told him she no longer worked for Crayon Academy.
Montoya tried to callFelicia Everett, the owner of Crayon Academy. He got a recording that the number was disconnected. He left a message for a third person at Crayon Academy, and did not get a reply in the next two weeks.
Crayon Academy "basicallydisappeared," said Assistant Attorney General Betty Wytias. "If you don't have any staff at the child placement agency, what do you have?"
