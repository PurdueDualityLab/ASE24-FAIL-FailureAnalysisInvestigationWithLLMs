Police arrested a Westminster foster father Thursday for allegedly killing a 2 1/2-year-old boy in his care by throwing the toddler to the floor because he had dirtied his diaper.
Ricky John Haney, 37, was being held on suspicion of child abuse resulting in the death of Miguel Arias-Baca. Bail was set at $100,000.
"He was irritated and he threw Miguel off the dresser onto the floor" after he found the boy had soiled his diaper, an arrest affidavit states.
Haney told police he picked up the boy and then slammed him to the floor, striking the back of his head, the affidavit said. Haney said he smeared feces on the boy's face and placed him on the toilet. He told police he'd been drinking.
The incident occurred the night of Jan. 31 after Haney returned home from a Super Bowl party. It's one of several recent cases to trigger an investigation into Colorado's child protection system by state officials.
Haney and his wife, E'von, brought the unconscious child to the hospital about 1 a.m. Feb. 1, saying he had fallen from a toilet. Miguel died the next day.
An autopsy report said the boy died of non-accidental massive trauma to the head and had bruises over most of his body. The report said the injury behind the boy's left ear would have led to death "in a very short time."
Haney's confession came Feb. 8 after police told him of the coroner's report.
"I didn't mean to kill no baby," he told detectives, according to the affidavit. "I'm not a murderer or anything like that. ... It was death by accident."
"I didn't mean to hurt him," Haney told detectives. "I love those kids."
Haney said he put the excrement on the boy's face as punishment, according to the affidavit.
His 14-year-old stepdaughter told detectives she heard what sounded like Haney hitting Miguel in the bathroom, the affidavit said. She looked in later, saw the toddler sitting on the toilet "with poop on his face and he was crying." 'I won't make it in prison'
She later saw the boy lying on the couch, "breathing shallow and staring into the air." The Haneys then took Miguel to the hospital and left the teenager home with their three other foster children.
Haney told detectives he would do anything to avoid jail because "I won't make it in prison."
"I'll volunteer for 20 years to pay for what happened. I'll do charity work. I'll work for kids programs," he said.
After the boy's death, Haney tried to commit suicide by taking NyQuil and Tylenol. In the affidavit, his 31-year-old wife told police he had suggested they both commit suicide by running a car in a closed garage.
Haney initially blamed his wife for Miguel's injuries. E'von Haney told police the day after the boy died she believed her husband was responsible, the affidavit said. Other foster kids removed
Miguel and his 14-month-old brother had been placed in the Haney home by a private child placement agency after social workers took them away from their mother in October because of drug use.
In all, the Haneys were caring for four foster children. It was their sole source of income. The other foster children were removed from their home after Miguel was taken to the hospital.
Miguel's mother, Odelia Baca, declined to comment Thursday, referring questions to her lawyer. The attorney could not be reached.
The Haneys each have arrest records - he for drunken driving in 1997 and she on suspicion of theft in December. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation should have notified the placement agency of their arrests but didn't because of two separate glitches.
Haney was arrested Thursday afternoon at his mother's home after police presented their case to Adams County District Attorney Bob Grant. Police had asked for a first-degree murder charge.
"We filed the charges that were appropriate," Grant said.
If convicted, Haney faces up to 48 years in prison. He's being held in the Adams County Jail and is expected to make his first court appearance today. Staff Writer Sheba R. Wheeler contributed to this report.
