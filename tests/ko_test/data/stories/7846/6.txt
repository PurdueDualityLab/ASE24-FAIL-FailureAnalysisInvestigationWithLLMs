Child deaths prompt study

Responding to reports of failures in the state's child protection system, Gov. Bill Owens on Monday directed his top human-services official to study the system and recommend changes to his office and the Legislature.
'The Denver Post has revealed the tragic consequences which occur when some of our most vulnerable children do not get the protection they deserve from our child protection systems,' Owens said in a statement. 'While I am convinced the vast majority of foster parents are dedicated to their foster children and provide loving homes for them, it is also clear that the system needs to be evaluated for quality of care.'
Marva Livingston Hammons, recently appointed executive director of the Colorado Department of Human Services, said her department is 'taking this very seriously.' 'Colorado's child welfare system needs to do a better job for children,' she said in a statement.
The Post reported Sunday on the deaths of 14-month-old Kayanna Pierce and 4-month-old Marquisha Richardson and on problems in the state's privatized foster-care network.
In Kayanna's case, family members, babysitters and an emergency-room doctor warned government social workers that the baby was being abused. Relatives pleaded with county officials to remove Kayanna from her Delta home, but they did not. Kayanna was beaten to death there in January by her mother's boyfriend, authorities said.
In Marquisha's case, a University Hospital social worker, physical therapist and outside specialist warned a Denver caseworker that the baby - born three months prematurely and in need of round-the-clock medical attention - might die if sent home with her 17-year-old mother.
The social worker did not intervene. Marquisha died three weeks after she went home with her mother, who allegedly missed all of her followup medical appointments. The medical examiner concluded that Marquisha might have lived if she had received followup care and questioned whether the baby's oxygen tank ran dry.
The Post also reported that when social workers do remove children from their homes, the youngsters face a two-tiered foster-care system of government-licensed homes and a private foster-care network, an industry that has boomed in recent years with little government oversight.
Last month, 2 1/2-year-old Miguel Arias Baca allegedly was beaten to death in his privately certified foster home in Westminster. The Colorado Bureau of Investigations was supposed to notify the private agency that the child's foster parents had arrest records. But in two separate glitches, the notifications never were made.
State Sen. Dorothy Rupert, D-Boulder, welcomed news of the state-level review and said it's time to re-examine Colorado's child protection laws. For decades, Colorado's laws emphasized keeping families together. Those laws changed last year to put the needs of the child first, but critics say social workers still bend over backward for abusive and neglectful families.
'Family preservation has been almost a mantra,' said Rupert, who sits on a statewide child fatality review panel and two Senate committees that deal with child welfare issues. 'Certainly it's important to keep families together, but if we don't keep the interest of the child first, then we've lost our battle,' she said.
Adoree Blair, a longtime Colorado foster parent who has helped reform child welfare laws, said the state needs to change confidentiality laws that allow counties and the state to hide bad decisions that harm children.
'We need to change our attitude from covering up our mistakes to saying, 'Let's work together to improve the system,'' she said.
