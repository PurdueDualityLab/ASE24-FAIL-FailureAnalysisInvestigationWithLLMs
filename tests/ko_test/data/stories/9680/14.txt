BASIC SKILLS TEST RESULTS: MANY SCHOOLS DO BETTER 9 PAGES OF CHARTS INSIDE: SCORES STILL INDICATE GAP BETWEEN WEALTHY, LOW-INCOME AREAS.

Local students continued to perform better than their peers across the state in California's basic skills test, but they struggled a bit with questions linked to the state's tough new academic standards.
Scores rose noticeably in many local elementary grades. But wide disparities in performance continue to exist between high-poverty schools and those in more affluent neighborhoods.
Those are just some of the conclusions gleaned from the school-by-school test results that the Mercury News is publishing today.
Charts on the following pages detail how area schools from Hayward to Hollister did, on average, against a national sample of students. Parents can use the information to see how their neighborhood schools performed in certain subject areas or grades.
This is the second year of California's Standardized Testing and Reporting program, which uses the Stanford-9 test to measure basic skills such as math and reading.
All second-grade through 11th-grade students enrolled in a California public school for more than 12 months -- regardless of language ability -- were required to take the Stanford-9 test unless parents requested they be exempted.
This year's release of results was beset with controversy. Because of a technical glitch by the testing company, Harcourt Educational Measurement, the state was unable to distribute scores for students with limited English skills. Those scores are expected to be available sometime next week.
Some unknowns
That makes it impossible to gauge the effects of Proposition 227, which all but banned bilingual education in the state last year. And it makes it impossible to see which schools on the following pages had large numbers of non-English-speaking students in their testing pool. That information is important because scores from limited-English-speaking students could have a significant effect on a school's overall score.
Despite those limitations, however, the scores provide a snapshot of how local students are doing academically. With two years of testing data, parents and educators can begin to see whether students, schools and districts are making progress.
This year, scores were generally up across the board and 5 points to 15 points higher than the state average. In Palo Alto's Hoover Elementary, third-grade math scores jumped from the 89th percentile last year to the 95th percentile this year. And Laneview Elementary in San Jose's Berryessa Union district gained three points on its third-grade reading scores, moving from the 46th percentile to the 49th.
The increases could be due to several things, including changes to a school's curriculum, increased familiarity with the test or changes in the student population.
Morgan Hill parent and former school board member Carol Neal is curious to know whether the state's push to reduce class sizes in early elementary grades is paying off.
'There's a lot of money in that program,' Neal said. 'I'd like to see how we're faring.'
This year's test also included a new set of questions -- known as the 'augmentation' -- that were tied to the state's new learning standards in math and language arts.
Scores for this newly developed portion of the test are reported in terms of the average percentage of questions correct. In some cases no scores are reported because of course-taking patterns at the high school level.
Educators have warned parents not to be alarmed if these scores appear low -- especially on the math portion -- since this is the first year the exam has been given. On average, local students answered about 40 percent to 60 percent of the questions correctly.
In the Evergreen School District in East San Jose, for example, fifth-graders answered about 55 percent of the language arts questions correctly and about half the math questions correctly.
The Stanford-9 test is a multiple choice, fill-in-the-bubble test designed to show how local students compare against a national sample of students. California students were compared to a sample of 500,000 to 600,000 students from across the country who voluntarily took the exam in the spring and fall of 1995. From that group, designed to represent a cross-section of students nationwide, the test publisher calculated 'average' scores.
Students in the national sample do not share all the characteristics of California students. For example, only 1.8 percent of the students in the national sample were limited-English-speaking, compared with 24.6 percent in California.
Researchers caution against drawing too many conclusions from school-to-school or district-to-district comparisons. Dozens of factors, including language ability and socio-economic status, can have a significant influence on scores.
One tool among many
For many districts, the Stanford-9 is just one of many evaluation tools intended to provide an accurate picture of student performance.
In the Sunnyvale School District, students are tested at least twice a year in writing. The district also conducts special reading assessments for students in the primary grades. And starting this year, the district began giving end-of-year exams in mathematics.
The goal, said Bob Lowry, the district's assistant superintendent for educational services, is to have as complete a picture as possible of student progress.
Tests such as Stanford-9 offer only a partial picture of how students are doing, Lowry said.
'On a multiple-choice test it may be luck when kids choose the right answer,' he said. 'Those exams only test grammar and tactical kinds of things in a very isolated kind of style.'
