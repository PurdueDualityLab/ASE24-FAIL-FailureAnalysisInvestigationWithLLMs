Student scores up only slightly

D.C. school officials are 'perplexed' as to why students made smaller gains on this year's Stanford 9 achievement tests than last year.
'Ninety percent of our schools showed progress,' Superintendent Arlene C. Ackerman said. 'We're not sliding backward.'
Data released at last night's Emergency Board of Trustees' public work session show that:
* The percentage of students in grades one through eight, 10 and 11 who scored in the 'below basic' category in reading was reduced from 28 percent in the 1997-98 school year to 27 percent this school year. About 34 percent scored below basic in the 1996-97 school year.
* The percentage of students in grades three, six, eight and 10 who scored below basic in mathematics was reduced from 49.31 percent to 48 percent. Two years earlier, 57 percent scored below basic.
School officials released only preliminary data last night for the high-stakes tests in reading and math.
They still want to analyze differences in student population and resolve computer glitches that led to incomplete data.
'We don't have all the information we'd like to have to make sure the report is accurate and complete,' said Sereatha Smith, associate superintendent for academic services.
Among those factors is the exodus of about 7,000 students to public charter schools and the withdrawal of students who are children of staff members who do not live in the District.
A more detailed report will be released in August.
Miss Smith said officials also believe progress may have been hindered because they were unable to implement intensive reforms at 23 targeted schools due to procurement problems.
'The question is, what is the impact of these differences on the test scores?' said Ed Masonis, national measurement consultant for Harcourt Brace Educational Measurement, the San Antonio-based testing firm that administers the Stanford 9 tests.
Mr. Masonis said about 48,000 D.C. students took the tests, which excluded open-ended questions for the second straight year. Students had to answer only multiple choice questions.
Students were grouped into four categories based on their score - below basic, basic, proficient and advanced.
Last year marked the first time in many years that D.C. students showed any improvement on standardized tests.
Miss Smith said the gains, while small, are significant.
'What we find perplexing is that the gains are there, but they are not as significant as we might have expected.'
Several trustees said they were pleased nonetheless.
'We are in the midst of an aggressive reform agenda,' said trustee Emily Washington, who is a D.C. public schoolteacher.
'We are talking about an entire cultural shift. It's not going to happen overnight.'
Mrs. Ackerman said she was not disappointed in the scores, and is happy that they didn't move backward.
'Do I want us to show more progress? Absolutely,' she said.
