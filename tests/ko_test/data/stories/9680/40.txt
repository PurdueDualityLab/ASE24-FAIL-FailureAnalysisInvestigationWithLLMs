Release of test scores again delayed

The public will have to wait at least another week _ the second postponement _ to see district-by-district and school-by-school results on the statewide test given to 4.5 million California students after the company in charge of tabulating the scores discovered additional problems with the test information.
First problems with the scores for students who can't speak English fluently delayed the June 30 release. Now about 190,000 students attending year-round schools in 44 districts throughout the state received the wrong scores on the Standardized Testing and Reporting exam given this spring.
No local schools were affected by this latest glitch, but the problem is significant enough for California Department of Education officials to delay plans to release scores for local schools and districts as scheduled on July 15.
For local educators, this latest news is just another in a series of missteps that have plagued the statewide testing program, now in its second year. Earlier this year, a handful of local districts, including Franklin-McKinley and Fremont Union High were forced to reschedule testing days when test booklets arrived late.
'I'm disappointed that we haven't received the information on time,' said Esau Herrera, a trustee in the Alum Rock Union School District. 'This has been in the cooker for a long time. All this money, all this leetime, (the publishers) should have delivered.'
The San Jose Mercury News published school-by-school scores on July 7 after downloading a database containing the results that was posted for a brief time on the department's web site. While department officials said they could not say whether the numbers were accurate, they could point to no problems with the specific scores. The Mercury News spot checked the information before publication and ran the scores of all students. It did not publish separate scores for limited English proficient students that were determined to be inaccurate.
Ed Slawski, a senior research scientist with the Texas-based Harcourt Educational Measurement said this latest problem was the result of an employee entering the wrong code for scoring the exams for students in year-round programs. The errors managed to slip through the company's quality control checks, until districts began noticing scores were much lower than expected.
'The problem is that when we do our checks we can't check every district so we might do a sample, and the problem was not pervasive enough where it would show up in a sample,' Slawski said.
Originally, scores on the statewide exam were scheduled to be posted on the Internet June 30. At the last minute, department of education officials, tipped off by districts, uncovered problems in the way scores for limited English-speaking students were calculated.
Harcourt mistakenly combined the scores of 250,000 fluent English speaking students with those of students who speak little or no English, causing districts to report dramatic achievement increases for their limited English speaking students. After apologizing for the mishap, the company pledged to work as quickly as possible to rectify the situation.
As a result department of education released only state-level information and did not break the scores down by language fluency.
For a state anxious to see whether the implementation of class size reduction and the elimination of bilingual education are making a difference, the news was frustrating.
'The problem with this is the focus is on the publisher's performance rather than student achievement,' said Doug Stone, spokesman for the California Department of Education. 'And it's achievement that matters.'
