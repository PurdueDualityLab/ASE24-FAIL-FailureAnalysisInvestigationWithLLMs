Schools in Glendale are among those affected by a second error discovered in statewide test scores already under revision because of a mistake in counting English-learning students, state school officials said Monday.
Harcourt Educational Measurement, the Texas-based firm that tested 4.5 million California students this spring, has notified the state about additional computer programming errors in the Stanford 9 standardized test, Doug Stone, spokesman for the state Department of Education, said Monday.
The problem this time is with students in at least 35 districts that have year-round schools, including the Glendale Unified School District, he said.
Glendale Unified was notified Friday about an additional problem, said district spokesman Vic Pallos. Of nine year-round schools, only two are affected, he said.
"I don't think at this time the glitch will change our numbers significantly. We may be affected slightly," Pallos said. "We'll have to wait and see."
Controversy has surrounded the scores on the annual Stanford 9 tests since last month, when it was found that students formerly classified as limited in English proficiency had been mistakenly lumped in with those so classified when they took the test, causing errors in aggregate scores.
By lumping about 250,000 students now fluent in English with English learners, Harcourt's results inflated the scores for those with limited proficiency, company officials acknowledged. Superintendent Delaine Eastin returned the data and asked for revised figures.
Test scores for the state, counties, districts and individual schools were supposed to be posted in the Internet on June 30. Eastin, however, released only the statewide numbers because of a programming error. Some school districts released scores on their own.
The department still plans to post the test scores on the Internet when all errors are fixed. The new estimated time is sometime next week, Stone said.
The state Board of Education is scheduled to decide Aug. 2 whether Harcourt has performed satisfactorily before state funds are released to districts to pay the company. Harcourt, which has separate contracts with 1,100 school districts, is scheduled to get $5.11 per student.
