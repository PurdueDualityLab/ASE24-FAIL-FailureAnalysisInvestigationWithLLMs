Pam Ellis noticed something awry in the Anaheim City School District's Stanford 9 test data.
Her discovery spawned the latest controversy in California's trouble-plagued testing system.
"There should have been 700 (limited-English students) in sixth grade, but they counted about 1,300," said Ellis, her district's director of testing.
Ellis phoned the state Department of Education on Tuesday, about two hours before a similar call came from San Jose Unified, said Gerry Shelton, the administrator in charge of testing.
After crunching numbers and exchanging phone calls with test publisher Harcourt Educational Measurement, Shelton concluded the glitch in Anaheim was the tip of an iceberg - 200,000 to 300,000 students statewide who had become fluent in English were mislabeled as limited-English because of a computer programmer's coding error. The snag delayed posting on the Internet of 90,000 pages of test scores for 4.2 million students.
"We believe it's more important to get it right and not confuse the public by publishing erroneous data," said state schools Superintendent Delaine Eastin.
"I think it's a colossal blunder," said Gov. Gray Davis, visiting San Diego County's Chula Vista High School. "We're going to work out the problem created by the company and hold them accountable."
Harcourt President Joanne Lenke blamed the error on the pressure of meeting state publication deadlines. Her 15-person quality-control team spent only two days reviewing this year's data for discrepancies and had no time to compare figures with 1998 information, something that could have helped in spotting the error, she said.
"It's really (up to) the districts we look at to report whether the numbers are sensible to them," Lenke added.
Eastin said the computer error might have been avoided if the state had a contract with Harcourt, which ex-Gov. Pete Wilson vetoed in favor of individual contracts with each of California's 998 school districts.
Harcourt has posted a $2.3 million performance bond with the state Board of Education, which meets in two weeks in Sacramento and could withhold payment if it finds contract violations. Board Vice President Kathryn Dronenburg said she needs more information before endorsing such a step.
Harcourt has faced other criticism over the tests.
Test booklets arrived too late for about 200 school districts that planned to begin giving exams in March. Harcourt paid Huntington Beach Union High School District $7,000 to cover the costs of rescheduling the tests.
Questions in a new math "augmentation" test, designed to measure student mastery of state standards, were criticized as lacking validity because of poor wording.
But California, which has had four testing programs in 10 years, should stick with the Stanford 9, Eastin said.
"We've got to stop starting over again every time there's a new governor, every time there's a problem," she said. John Gittelsohn can be reached at John-Gittelsohn@link.freedom.com.
