TESTING COMPANY GRILLED ON GLITCHES

Test publisher Harcourt Educational Measurement endured a stern grilling by the state Board of Education on Thursday over its handling of California's massive student testing program, which has been bedeviled by a series of high-profile snafus.
The board will not decide until Aug. 2 whether to penalize Harcourt by withholding any of a $2.3 million performance bond the company has posted.
But board members wanted top company officials to explain why the testing program, which cost the state a total of $34 million, has been so glitch-prone.
Two major problems have hampered the release of school-by-school results from the state's testing program, known as STAR. The first involved Harcourt's accidental grouping together of scores from students fluent in English with those not fluent. The second snafu involved the incorrect calculation of scores for 44 school districts, most with year-round schedules.
Harcourt officials apologized for the errors, and announced several steps intended to prevent future problems. Those include a quality control audit by an outside consulting firm, a new management team to run the STAR program and stricter oversight of Harcourt's subcontractors, who contributed to some of the problems.
'We have learned our lesson about not taking enough time to check our work,' said Jack Dilworth, group president of Harcourt. 'You have our sincere commitment from everyone at Harcourt that we will make this right. We will make this a model program.'
The board's official response will not come until next month. But board member Marion Joseph appeared dissatisfied with Harcourt's presentation.
'I really don't like the response that we'll do it better,' said Joseph, of Menlo Park. 'Not better. Get it right. . . . This is serious business.'
Ironically, Thursday's inquisition included revelations of yet another technical problem that could have a major impact on the release of scores, which is now scheduled for next week. Deputy Superintendent of Public Instruction Scott Hill told the board Harcourt cannot determine the language classification of nearly 420,000 students who took the exam this spring.
Hill said the problem, affecting about 10 percent of all those tested, appeared not to be the fault of Harcourt but of local educators who failed to answer a question on each test about language proficiency.
This latest glitch could seriously hamper efforts to evaluate the academic progress of students with limited English language skills, who just spent their first year under a new state law that all but bans bilingual education.
Despite their dissatisfaction, board members appeared reluctant to sever their five-year contract with Harcourt, which comes up for review next year. State schools chief Delaine Eastin argued against breaking ties with the San Antonio-based company, noting that so much is now invested in Harcourt's test, including a new school accountability program.
'We've got to make this work,' Eastin said. 'You can't be changing the contract for a test year after year.'
But board members did endorse a bill moving through the Legislature that would allow the Department of Education to sign just one statewide contract with Harcourt. As it stands now, Harcourt holds separate testing agreements with each of the state's 1,055 school districts and the state board, an arrangement that some say complicates efforts to monitor the testing program.
'We have a statewide system that we're building, and we need a statewide contract,' said Eastin.
In the meantime, Eastin said, she wants the board to 'send a message' to Harcourt by withholding part of the performance bond the company posted with the state to guarantee its work. They could also withhold 5 percent, or $1.1 million of the $22 million contract.
Also Thursday, the board decided to wait an extra year before adding new history-social science and science questions to the test. The questions, which are intended to reflect California's new academic standards, were supposed to be added to next spring's test. But the education department urged the board to wait, arguing that schools need more time to become familiar with recently adopted math and language arts standards.
'What we need is time for everybody to get in gear with the new standards,' Eastin said. 'We want to use this year to focus like a laser on math and language arts, and then we can move on down the path to the other subjects.'
