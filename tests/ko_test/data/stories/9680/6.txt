As school years go, the one that just ended in Clay County was high octane.
From improved state test scores throughout the county to the opening of the new Ridgeview High School, from the dramatic reversal of Orange Park Elementary School's fortunes to one of the most innovative senior class pranks in Clay High School history, the 1998-1999 school term was a banner year.
'Everybody is ready for summer to start, but I have felt a mood of being well-pleased with what went on during the year,' said School Superintendent David Owens. 'I can't say anything negative. The whole year has been wonderful.'
Owens visited about half the district's 28 schools on Thursday, the last day for students. The end of school came and went without any major problems, he said.
But Owens, who was a longtime principal before he was elected superintendent three years ago, said half-jokingly that he would not exhale fully until all of Clay County's graduations were over. Until then, mischief might still be in the offing, he said.
'I always hold my breath until the last name is called for graduation,' he said. 'They're through with school, they're out from under our supervision.'
While students were in school this year, they accomplished something in which Owens puts high stock -- improved student achievement.
One of the district's proudest accomplishments this year, he said, was that on state tests such as the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test, Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills and Florida Writes!, most Clay schools were at or above state averages, with many showing gains over last year.
'I am so pleased with that,' Owens said. 'It shows how well teachers . . . work together on test scores in improving our standings. It has been a team effort, a concentrated effort.'
Clay High principal Pete McCabe, whose school posted the county's highest scores on Florida Writes! and made gains over last year in other scores, also credited teachers and intensive reading and math programs.
'I'm going to blow that horn,' he said.
Another form of student achievement -- the senior class prank -- had McCabe's pride swelling again during the final week of school.
Last weekend, seven members of the graduating class, with help from a friendly mechanic and a blow torch, carefully wrapped an old Volkswagen around the school flagpole -- without making a scratch on the car or the pole.
The group, which initially kept its identity secret but later came forward to McCabe, painted the car blue -- Clay High's teams are the Blue Devils -- and painted Class of 1999 on it in white. They left a note declaring the car as the school's 'new mascot' and said it was 'our contribution [and] a token of our school spirit. Last of the decade, best of the decade.'
A postscript on the note said 'the devil made us do it.'
Someone later affixed a parking violation sticker to the car's window.
McCabe, who allowed the car to stay in place for the last week of school, through graduation, said he was proud of the students' creativity and ingenuity.
'This was just so unique,' he said. 'It's funny, it's all in good taste and it took a lot of work. Kids are neat. Kids are fun.'
While principals, teachers and students were going about the usual academic and extracurricular activities this year, Owens and the Clay County School Board were busy planning new schools and the future of existing ones.
The latest new school to open was Ridgeview High, which just completed its first year of operation with only minor glitches, said Principal Joanne Roberts.
'It went very well. Overall, we have been very pleased,' she said. 'The kids have been great and the community has been supportive.'
Meanwhile, the board struck out on a proposed site for a new elementary school north of Green Cove Springs. Area residents vehemently opposed the plan, and the Clay County Commission refused to make a necessary zoning change.
The board was to talk about alternative sites at a workshop yesterday and at its regular meeting tomorrow.
But a third elementary school for the fast-growing Fleming Island area, named Thunderbolt Elementary, will be under construction shortly and the district is moving forward with plans for a new elementary school in the Lake Asbury area.
Also this year, Owens and the board -- with help from legislators, particularly state Sen. Jim Horne, R-Orange Park -- saved the life of 72-year-old Orange Park Elementary.
Owens proposed in 1998 that the the school be closed and converted to an Adult and Community Education Center. Orange Park's Concept School program, which features reduced class sizes, enhanced extracurricular activities and contractual commitments from parents and students, was to be moved to Montclair Elementary.
Parents of students at both schools were outraged. Later in 1998, Owens postponed the change to 2002. But last month, after the Legislature changed its school construction funding formula, Owens and the board determined that Clay could afford to keep Orange Park Elementary and build needed new schools.
As a result, the school year at Orange Park Elementary ended on a high note, rather than a somber, uncertain one, with faculty, parents and students eagerly anticipating the future.
'Certainly, to have it resolved was important for the community, as well as the staff. There had been so many ups and downs,' said Principal Jean Niemi. 'Bringing closure to that was beneficial for everyone.'
