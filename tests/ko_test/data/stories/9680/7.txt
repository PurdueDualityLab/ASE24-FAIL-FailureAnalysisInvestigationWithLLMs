Angry and frustrated over errors plaguing the statewide test that is the centerpiece of California's school-improvement efforts, the state Board of Education on Thursday grilled the Texas company that produced the exam.
Board members won't decide until Aug. 2 whether to impose any financial penalties on Harcourt Education Measurement of San Antonio, which is scheduled to be paid $ 22 million for the test.
'It is not my goal to extract blood from Harcourt, but there has to be some equitable settlement,' said board member Yvonne Larsen of San Diego.
The state could withhold up to 5 percent of the payment, or about $ 1.1 million, at the August meeting, and could seize Harcourt's $ 2.2 million performance bond by Dec. 31.
Also, the 1,100 local school districts that have separate contracts with Harcourt could decide this fall to withhold part of their payment to the test maker.
'School districts around the state are angry because boards are being held accountable for what's happening,' Kevin Gordon of the California School Boards Association told the board.
The state's 2-year-old Standardized Testing and Reporting program, known as STAR, has been beset by problems and glitches this year. In addition to concerns about math and English questions in the exam, a series of errors has prevented full and accurate scores from being released for the main part of the test, Harcourt's national Stanford 9 exam.
Harcourt was late in delivering tests to some districts last spring. The company miscounted about 250,000 English-speaking students as English learners, inflating the scores for the latter. A NCS employee also made a mistake in calculating scores for year-round schools in 44 districts.
A new problem cropped up Thursday, although it is not necessarily the fault of Harcourt. The company said scores of 419,550 students were not marked by school districts as either fluent in English or English learners, so they were excluded from average scores for both those groups.
Harcourt delivered electronic files with statewide, county, school district and school scores to the state on June 29, to be posted on the Internet the next day as required by state law.
However, when the miscount of English-learning students was discovered, state schools Superintendent Delaine Eastin released only statewide scores and sent the rest back for correction.
Harcourt delivered new data to the state Thursday, although state Education Department spokesman Doug Stone said not all of the material had been received by late Thursday afternoon. State education officials plan to check the scores very carefully and, if they look good, release them on the Internet next week.
Officials from Harcourt and its subcontractors insisted the test is 'valid and reliable.' They said they have hired an independent consultant to audit Harcourt's quality-assurance procedures, are reimbursing any school districts with costs caused by problems with the tests and are restructuring management to improve communication.
'We will make this a model program and we will put every resource behind it,' said Harcourt executive Jack Dilworth.
'This program is very, very important to both of our companies,' added Jack Strang of Harcourt's main subcontractor, National Computer Systems. 'Our reputations are at stake.'
Board members made it clear that while they're upset with Harcourt, they're unwilling to scrap the test and start over with some other test maker.
'We have got to make this work,' said Eastin. 'The lessons of the other states are you can't be changing your contractors and tests every year.'
The test, given for the first time in 1998, is part of the state's effort to improve the dismal performance of California's 5.7 million public schoolchildren on nearly every national measure.
In the past few years, the state has approved tough new standards outlining what students in each grade should learn and imposed a series of tests.
This year's test scores will be used as a baseline for Gov. Gray Davis' school-improvement plan. The scores will determine which schools are eligible for a $ 96 million intervention plan and whether schools meet new improvement goals of at least 5 percent by next year.
The state board did decide Thursday to delay for one year the tough new science and history questions that were previously scheduled to be added to the test next spring.
Board members agreed with Eastin that it would be better to let schools concentrate first on getting textbooks and training teachers to meet the math and English standards.
Questions based on those subjects were added to the spring 1999 test and prompted complaints by teachers and parents that most schools had not had time to start teaching according to the standards. Textbooks based on the math standards were not approved by the board until last month.
'People can only absorb so much change at one time,' said board member Kathryn Dronenburg, who is a teacher in El Cajon.
