With one exception, public elementary schools increased their test scores on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills according to test scores released last week. The test is administered to third-graders to assess their reading skills.
Kennedy School students improved the most with 84 percent of students scoring proficient or advanced, compared with 46 percent two years ago, the first year of the exam. The Lincoln Park Community School dropped from 59 percent to 54 percent of students scoring advanced or proficient during the same period. Lincoln had the lowest scores of all Somerville schools and Winter hill Community School had the highest, 96 percent.
When four of nine schools had 50 percent or fewer students score advanced or proficient in 1997, school officials offered students more help.
"We did a number of things through professional development and brought people in and worked and worked and worked with the staff," said Albert Argenziano, superintendant of schools. "We provided before-school and after-school tutoring and readiness for the Iowa test and the MCAS." A progress report on school renovations
Renovations at the Healy School are almost complete but construction at the Kennedy School is going slowly, school officials said last week. They said the Kennedy project is on schedule and expected to be completed by the beginning of the next school year. The Brown School construction has been held up because solicitor Joan Langsam is still negotiating with the owner of the abutting residence, whose name was not available. Eventually, the school will be rebuilt and expanded to the adjacent lot. Eighth-grader shines in history
Janelle Dempsey, an eighth-grade student at Kennedy Elementary School, finished in the top 10 during national History Day competition. Students worked on video projects for several months and presented them at a statewide competition in Belmont. About 2,000 finalists went to the national competition at the University of Maryland two weeks ago. Dempsey competed with about 400,000 other students. Meetings continue on Y2K problems City officials have begun meeting with the Somerville Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for potential problems in the year 2000.
Although officals representing various agencies said they are Y2K compliant, they are not ready to handle a large-scale power outtage. During an exercise designed by the Massachusetts Emergency Management Association, fire, police, and Department of Public Works officials found glitches in their ability to communicate within agencies and coordinate services for residents should telephones not be available.
They are prepared to handle basic needs of residents such as shelter and medical attention, they said, but haven't made plans for items such as getting food for those evacuated, establishing a priority list for responding to requests for help and communicating across agencies and outside the city. They are also prepared to handle multiple emergencies.
Kevin Prior, a MEMA official, said the city has done a good job so far and he made recommendations for shoring up remaining items.
As a result of the meeting, each agency will send a list to the mayor's office with a primary and secondary contact person, telephone and pager numbers and addresses, just in case all means of communication are down. A current list exists, officials said, but is not complete or up to date. Officials also will get letters of agreement from the MBTA, which may need to transport evacuees, food service outlets, and medical associates, who may need to treat evacuees while EMTs are handling other emergencies.
"This is the only disaster event when we can sit down and know the day when things are going to happen," said Fire Chief Kevin Kelleher. "These elderly people hear about it and they're already upset. We want to be able to say to the public `If something happens, we can take care of you.' "
The committee members will continue to meet until they are certain they are prepared and then residents will be informed about services and emergency procedures. For tenants who are interested in office
The Somerville Housing Authority has scheduled a meeting tomorrow at 6:30 p.m. in the Mystic Activities Center for residents of the Mystic Housing Development interested in running for the tenants association.
