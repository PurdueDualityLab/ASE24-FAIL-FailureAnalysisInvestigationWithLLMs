Surge in California Test Scores Deflated by Calculation Error

Because thousands of students who are fluent in English were mistakenly classified as not fluent, test scores showing gains for immigrant students in the wake of a California ban on bilingual education were inflated, school officials said Wednesday.
California, home to more immigrants than any other state, has become a national bellwether in the debate over bilingual education, which was banned by state voters last year. The reporting error in a controversial test has only added to the debate.
Though statewide results of the test, the SAT-9, were not revealed until Wednesday, some school districts previously had released their own scores. Because some districts reported such high gains for immigrant students, scores well above those for their English-speaking peers, opponents of bilingual education had touted the results as evidence of the ban's merits.
Harcourt Educational Measurement, which prepared the report on students' scores on the tests, erroneously categorized some 200,000 students with English proficiency as having only limited proficiency in English, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin said Wednesday, as statewide results were announced.
"This is a serious glitch and we hope that Harcourt is going to move apace to get it fixed," Eastin said Wednesday.
One suburban San Diego school district in particular had been held up as an ideal test case for the English-immersion approach to teaching immigrant students. Oceanside Unified School District became the state's sole district to drop all non-English instruction, rather than seek waivers to allow some students to continue bilingual education.
On Wednesday, Oceanside school officials released revised scores, which were still being refined at day's end to see how students learning English fared in comparison to their English-fluent peers. While the immigrant students' scores still showed strong improvement, the most spectacular gains fell substantially as a result of the revision -- in some cases to a level nearly a fourth of what previously had been reported.
In the lower grades, scores actually improved after the reporting was corrected. For instance, reading scores for second-graders rose 117 percent rather than the 100 percent previously reported. For third-graders the scores rose at higher rates, and for fourth-graders the scores remained the same.
But for all other grades, rates of improvements fell as a result of the correction. The highest level of improvement in reading, which had been reported for seventh-graders, fell from 475 percent to 200 percent.
