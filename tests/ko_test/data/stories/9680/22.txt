Stanford 9 drawing a chorus of criticism EDUCATION: Some, like Santa Ana Superintendent Al Mijares, want to re-examine the test. But supporters say it's doing its job.: [MORNING Edition]

The test at the heart of Gov. Gray Davis' new accountability program has lost the trust of many who say the exam is so flawed the state ought to dump it and start again.
Results from the Stanford 9 test will be used to award millions of dollars to schools that do well and could lead to state takeovers of those that fail. Teachers who help turn around low-performing schools could get bonuses as high as $25,000.
But is the test - which suffered another embarrassment Wednesday when a computer glitch led to the distribution of inaccurate group scores - reliable?
"I'm not comfortable with it, and the people I work with are not either," said Al Mijares, superintendent at Santa Ana Unified, the county's largest district. "We are concerned with the credibility of the test."
Mijares is calling on Davis and the Legislature to examine the testing program and perhaps place a moratorium on its use. Others would go further.
"It would be better to scrap the whole thing," said Day Higuchi, president of United Teachers of Los Angeles, which represents 40,000 teachers in the state's largest district.
Higuchi said he is most concerned about the gap between what students have been taught and what they were asked to do on a new math portion of the exam. Those questions reflected the state's new, tough standards - material that many students have never been exposed to.
That was clear from the results. Even in eighth through 10th grades, where only the most advanced pupils were tested on the math standards, students on average got barely half the questions correct.
"Teachers are perfectly happy to raise standards and to be asked to shoot for the moon," Higuchi said. "When they are tested on whether or not they got their kids to Mars, that's a different ballgame."
The questions about the Stanford 9 exam come as the state is considering adding five other mandated exams to the school year, including a graduation test.
A Davis administration spokeswoman said the governor will not drop the test from his accountability program.
"No consideration is being given to scrapping the test," said Ann Bancroft, spokeswoman for Education Secretary Gary Hart. "We think it's very important."
But critics see many problems:
In the national sample against which California students are measured, fewer than 2 percent of the children were classified as less than fluent in English. But in California, almost 25 percent of the students don't speak English fluently. That disparity makes California scores look worse in comparison to kids elsewhere.
Scores on the reading portion of the test have dropped dramatically between the eighth and ninth grades in each of the past two years. The inexplicable decline has left some wondering whether the problem is in the test and not with the students.
"We are becoming more convinced that this is an anomaly," said state Supt. Delaine Eastin.
The test now has more than 300 items and takes nearly six hours to complete, a difficult chore for high school students but downright grueling for second-graders. Students get so tired that they can't do their best work, said Mary Bergan, president of the California Federation of Teachers.
The test takes "longer for the kids to get through than the State Bar or medical board exams," Bergan said.
The window during which schools can give the test closes May 15. That means as the curriculum gets tougher, many children will inevitably be tested on some material they have never seen. And schools that are able to delay administering the test until the last minute will have an advantage over schools that give it earlier.
High school students now are taking the Scholastic Aptitude Test, advanced placement tests for college, the Golden State exams - and the Stanford 9.
"Kids ultimately will start shutting down, and they are going to put their effort into what is important to them," said Patricia Clark-White, superintendent at Irvine Unified. "Finals are important to them. SAT scores are important to them. But Stanford 9 scores are not."
With the stakes - and the criticism - rising, the last thing the test needed was serious doubt about its reliability. But that's what happened Wednesday when the state and the publisher announced that a computer programming error had produced inflated scores for students with limited English skills.
"This test cannot lose its credibility," said Marion Joseph, a member of the state Board of Education. "As a baseline for our entire accountability system, it is critical that it be done properly."
Joseph and Marian Bergeson, a former Newport Beach lawmaker who also serves on the state board, said they plan to push for stronger quality controls.
"Any time you have glitches, I think people start asking questions, and we want to maintain as high a reliability as we can," Bergeson said.
But Bergeson said she would oppose any move to shelve the test.
"That would really set us back," she said.
Other defenders of the exam say results showing that students were tested on material they had not seen should set off alarm bells for parents and educators. The results from this year's test, they say, confirm that the state's new standards - as intended - were set at a level significantly higher than most students are used to.
"Some districts have adjusted, but many have not," said Bill Evers, a research fellow at the Hoover Institute and a member of the commission that wrote the standards. "It takes a test to show the state is serious."
He noted that the Legislature plans to spend $1 billion over four years to update textbooks to match the standards in every school in the state.
"There is no reason, except lack of effort and a decision to do it, why the schools and the districts cannot take this material and overhaul their programs and buckle down and bring the kids to this level," he said.
Joseph said the "whole point" of testing students on the standards was to establish a baseline from which to measure growth.
"This is a picture of what California youngsters look like now, just as we start down this road," she said. "The purpose of this endeavor was to get our schools in gear."
