NASHVILLE -- A problem delaying the release of public school assessment scores for a month has left teachers and principals scrambling to decide which children to pass and fail.
It's also causing problems for school systems that use the Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program test results to determine eligibility for summer school and for teacher participation in summer staff development sessions.
The TCAP tests are given to public school students in Tennessee each spring to evaluate their progress, the effectiveness of academic lessons and teacher job performance.
Three weeks ago, testing supervisors at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville conducting a routine review of the results found an across-the-board drop in fifth-grade language arts scores, said Ben Brown, director of evaluation and assessment for the state Department of Education.
The 64,000 scores reviewed in 11 school systems should have been up and down compared to the year before, he said.
The test maker, California-based CTB/McGraw-Hill, has corrected a scoring flaw and is rescoring the tests. Brown said the state expects to begin sending out the results June 20.
They usually are sent out before the end of the school year in May.
Brown said some parents across the state are now having to wait for scores before enrolling their children in private schools.
In Hamilton County Schools, the main effect of the delay is that parents who want to see their child's test scores will have to pick them up at the school system when the results come in, said schools testing director Kirk Kelly.
The scores are expected to arrive in two to four weeks, Dr. Kelly said.
There were 24,000 students tested in grades 3 through 8, so it would be too costly for the school system to send the test results through the mail, he said.
The tests do not count toward children's grades, so they should not concern parents who are wondering whether their children are eligible for summer school, he said. In the local school system, the tests are only used as a tool to determine how well the curriculum is working, he said.
In Wilson County, the problem could affect participation in summer staff development sessions because teachers often use test results to decide what courses to take.
In Rutherford County, school officials will have to forward test scores to students who are changing schools. 'It's not a major problem for us, but it is inconvenient,' said spokeswoman Wendi Watts.
In Nashville, this was to be the first year for teachers to use a checklist of objective standards including grades, attendance, test scores and mastery of basic skills in order to promote or retain students.
Karen Catignani, a sixth-grade teacher at Head Middle School, said the delay forced her to make tough judgment calls on promoting several students.
'It just really taught the wrong lesson to kids because we told them about the policy all year long,' she said. '... And what it came down to in the end is the scores didn't come back, (the policy) didn't really matter. Make a decision yourself.'
But Fall-Hamilton Elementary School Principal Phil Pennington said school officials had plenty of information to make promotion decisions.
'Would we have liked to have had (the test scores)? We would have been delighted,' Pennington said. 'They were not judgment calls. There were just so many standards our children had to meet.'
