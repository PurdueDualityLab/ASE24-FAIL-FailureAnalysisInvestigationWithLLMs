Antelope Valley Union High School District scores increased in the state's Stanford 9 student achievement exam, though they remained below the national average.
In the Antelope Valley Union High School District, average scores were better than or equal to 1998 scores except two categories: total reading and social science at the 10th-grade level, which dropped one point each.
"Reviewing the test scores, we showed that we made progress compared to last year," said the district's community relations coordinator, Linda Solcich. "However, it's agreed upon that they're not at where we'd like them to be districtwide. An enormous effort will be made for next year to take those necessary actions to improve those test scores."
This is the second year California pupils took the Stanford Achievement Test, Ninth Edition, or Stanford 9, picked by the state board of education as California's standardized achievement test under 1997 legislation.
The 1997 legislation authorized a program called STAR, for Standardized Testing and Reporting, which requires that all California public school students in grades 2 through 11 take a single standardized achievement test each spring to measure progress in basic academic schools.
This, the second year of the test, has seen a couple of glitches.
State officials disclosed on Wednesday that results reported for students who speak limited English were wrong, apparently because they included the scores of students more fluent in English.
And on Wednesday, the state Department of Education's Web site failed to post statewide scores as scheduled.
So Antelope Valley school results were dribbling out as they were released by local school districts. At Lancaster School District, for example, officials said they had not received the scores themselves.
At the school district, where the results were released Wednesday, officials were generally pleased.
At Keppel Union School District, average scores went up about 1.4 points in reading, 3.4 points in mathematics and 4.9 points in language, interim superintendent Thomas Niekamp said. Except for a couple exceptions, however, they remained below the national average.
"We think it's because we worked very hard in a lot of different areas to try to improve them this year," Niekamp said.
Keppel assigned classroom goals for moving up pupils' achievement levels and is in the process of realigning its curriculum to meet new state standards, Niekamp said.
At Palmdale School District, average scores went up in all but two grade-level categories - in math, for example, they were up by 8 points for second-graders, 14 points for third-graders and 9 points for fifth-graders - but like Keppel and high school scores remained below the national average.
At the single-school Hughes-Elizabeth Lakes Union School District, scores in 13 of the 18 grade-level categories exceeded the national average, though a comparison with last year's results was not available.
"Most of them are pretty good," Superintendent and Principal Robert Haley said of the 1999 results.
To improve scores at the high school district, officials want to implement more writing assignments in all subjects and to reduce the size of English and math classes to 20 students. Another proposal is to make all ninth-grade students take algebra.
"It's going to be a process. It's not in one year you can't expect the numbers to jump," Solcich said. "But they showed improvement, and we're happy with that. The efforts that were made this past year showed results, now we have to take it one step further. Now we have those numbers to conquer next year."
