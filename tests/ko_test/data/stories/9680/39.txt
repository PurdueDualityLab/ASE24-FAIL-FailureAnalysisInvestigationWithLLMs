LANSING, Mich. (AP) - The Michigan Department of Education is delaying the release of this year's elementary and middle school state assessment tests because of a scoring error, officials said Thursday.
The department was scheduled to release results for some of the Michigan Educational Assessment Program tests on Friday. Fourth-and seventh-grade reading and math and fifth- and eighth-grade science and writing scores were to be released.
But earlier this week, someone in the MEAP office discovered that the fifth-grade science tests were scored incorrectly. Now officials are rechecking all the tests to make sure they have accurate scores.
"The data we have is insufficient," state Superintendent Art Ellis said Thursday.
"When we announce the MEAP test scores, we want to be sure to paint a full and accurate picture. At present, we are not confident enough to risk misinforming educators, parents or the 1.4 million Michigan children in our schools."
Department of Education spokesman Brad Wurfel said the scores are likely to be announced sometime next week.
