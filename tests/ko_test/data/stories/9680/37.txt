The state will miss a July 1 deadline to release standardized test scores because of problems with the delivery and handling of some tests.
The problems, which include lost tests, labeling problems and a slower scoring process, do not appear to have compromised the validity of this year's tests.
Testing experts are still criticizing the situation.
'It's unforgivable,' said Arizona State University West education Professor Thomas Haladyna, a testing expert. 'I'm disappointed. It reflects sloppiness on the testing company.'
Though individual students have received their scores for the Stanford 9 test, they won't know how they measure up against other students statewide until all scores are released July 21.
Individual districts also do not know where they stand among others, causing some parents to worry about how their children can plan their futures.
'It's going to be inconvenient for lot of students and parents who count on those scores to use as a guideline for college,' said Scottsdale resident Nancy Cantor. 'When you are trying to put those pieces of a puzzle together, sometimes you slip up. This is one of those things. Students and parents must have all these things to provide a good education and to seek a good route to get that information.'
