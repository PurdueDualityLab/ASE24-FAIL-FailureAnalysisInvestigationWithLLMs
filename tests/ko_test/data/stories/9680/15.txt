Superintendent: System that led to takeover flawed

MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - For the first time ever, an Alabama school will be taken over by the state, even though some other schools had poorer scores on a test used by Alabama as the chief measurement of academic performance.
Gadsden School Superintendent Fred Taylor said he thinks there is a "glitch in program."
Litchfield High School, a magnet school in Gadsden, scored worse on this April's Stanford Achievement Test than it did in 1998. Of the 34 schools and one system at risk for takeover, only Litchfield, which has about 260 students, failed to make some sort of improvement.
Any improvement at all would have saved the high school from state action under a new regulation made by the state Board of Education in March to comply with a 1995 law that ranks the schools based on their SAT scores.
State School Superintendent Ed Richardson said that Litchfield's scores actually are higher than those at some other schools that faced potential state action. But he said the concerns are over its failure to make improvements.
"We have a situation where a school that scored in the 40s could be taken over and where those scoring in the 20s are not being taken over," Taylor said.
SAT results released Wednesday show that 47 schools and five school systems could face state intervention next year.
"It's not just us this year," Taylor said. "There's a whole flaw in the system that's going to be there every year. I don't think it will hold up unless we're taking over the truly lowest schools."
He said he's afraid this sends the public the message that Litchfield is the lowest performing school in the state.
Litchfield's SAT scores improved in 1997 and 1998, but the scores were still under the state's previous mandated improvement rate.
"We didn't get recognition for improving," principal Tony Reddick said.
Richardson, who has said he expected far more schools to be taken over, said Litchfield is a small school and the some 50 transfer students it had this year could have affected its SAT results "dramatically."
He said the magnet school is heavily focused on technology and consultants will be trying to determine if that may have impacted scores.
The state Board of Education is expected to vote July 13 to begin a takeover at the school. Three or four professionals would be placed in the school full-time to improve its performance. The state will decide if Reddick will stay on as principal. But if he does, he "won't be in control of the school," Richardson said.
Gov. Don Siegelman said Wednesday that the takeover will not be a case of "big brother" coming in.
"It's a matter of everybody taking some ownership," he said. "We all must come together as a community and help this school."
