The discovery of more computer glitches has delayed the release of California's school-by-school test scores yet another week, the Department of Education said Monday.
State Superintendent Delaine Eastin had hoped to release the scores on the Internet by this Thursday, two weeks after the legal deadline. That date was missed after schools discovered that the test publisher had lumped scores of limited-English students with recently fluent students, skewing the results.
The latest wrinkle, according to DOE's Gerry Shelton, was finding that 44 districts with year-round schools - including two in Orange County - also had been scored improperly.
"Everyone's confidence is a little shaken by this," said Shelton, who said scores of all districts with year-round schedules are being reviewed again by Harcourt Educational Measurement, publisher of the Stanford 9 test used in the state.
Scores at Pio Pico Elementary in Santa Ana and two schools in Capistrano Unified - Las Palmas and San Juan elementaries - were miscalculated, state officials said.
A Harcourt data analyst mistakenly compared students on year-round schedules with students who had more days of teaching before taking the test. Test analysts say that, once corrected, this may cause individual students' scores to rise slightly, but may be insignificant in raising district or state scores.
"We are flabbergasted by the series of mistakes we're seeing from Harcourt," said Al Mijares, superintendent of Santa Ana Unified school district, affected by both computer glitches. "It's demoralizing and breeds cynicism, because our credibility - to the public - is wrapped up into their mistakes."
