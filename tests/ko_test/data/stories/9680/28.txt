TEST-SCORE GLITCH PUTS STUDENTS, SCHOOLS IN A CRUNCH

Some Memphis students will start summer not knowing where they'll be enrolled in the fall, and principals are holding off on designing school-improvement plans.
Those are two of the consequences of a mistake in scoring the TCAP, the standardized, statewide public school assessment test administered in April to grades 3-8.
"It's terribly inconvenient," Dr. Kathy Pruett, Memphis City Schools' coordinator of research and evaluation, said Thursday.
"Parents won't have results before school is out. Teachers won't have results before school is out. Then we have the problem of how we get the results to parents when we get them."
The city's public school year ends today. County schools let out a week ago.
Both systems have yet to figure out exactly how they're going to get the scores into parents' hands this summer.
"We will design a plan to distribute the test scores to the schools," said Karen Woodard, the county system's supervisor of testing. Parents may be asked to run by their child's school to pick up the score, she said.
The scores are normally distributed the last few weeks of school, but the state this year won't begin sending them out until late this month.
Last month, testing supervisors at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville were conducting a routine review of the results when they found an across-the-board drop in several areas, especially fifth- grade language arts scores, said Bill Sanders, professor and director of the UT Value-Added Research and Assessment Center.
The score samples of 8,000 students reviewed in 11 school systems should have been both up and down compared to the previous year.
"It looked like these kids had gone brain dead," Sanders said. ". . .Needless to say I'm not a very happy camper about it. As hard as we work to do this stuff accurately and effectively, to see something like that."
The test-maker, California-based CTB/McGraw-Hill, "screwed up," has corrected the flaw and is scoring the tests again, Sanders said.
Officials with the county and city systems said Thursday they don't anticipate major problems, mainly inconveniences to the schools and parents.
By tracking a student's progress year by year, the TCAP (Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program) test can help show how well teachers, schools and school districts are educating children. For the second year, this year's version of the TCAP was the TerraNova test.
Neither the city nor county system uses the TCAP scores to determine whether a student will pass or fail or attend summer school, or even what summer staff development sessions teachers will participate in.
However, the city district does use the scores to determine whether this year's third-graders - having just taken their first TCAP - are eligible to enroll next fall for fourth grade in the academically enriched optional schools.
And some older students may be counting on improved TCAP scores to make them eligible for an optional school, said Linda Sklar, optional schools coordinator.
"I'm holding them," Keystone Elementary principal JoAnne Jensen said of about 10 applications from parents who want to enroll their children in Keystone, an optional school.
"I've had to hold their applications until I get the scores."
Few parents have called Sklar's office yet. But she expects more calls after parents realize school is out but they don't have their child's TCAP scores.
Many school administrators may be delayed in creating their school-improvement plans, which are based in part on the latest TCAP scores.
"Schools are writing school-improvement plans," Pruett said. "It's difficult to write it based on partial knowledge. That process could be hampered or delayed.
"(Administrators) are normally thinking about that now. People on the ball are going to use the results very quickly for structuring things next year. . . . Not having the scores before school is out and before teachers leave for the summer makes it a little bit difficult to figure out what to do next year."
County principals will probably conduct some in-service training with teachers using the test scores to develop improvement plans, Woodard said. "That will still be done," she said.
