A SUB-postmaster from Bristol used his own savings to pay his customers after a computer-controlled payment system crashed. Sam Govani took money from his bank account so he could pay out pensions and other vital benefits to customers at Lawrence Hill Post Office.
Mr Govani, aged 39, acted when he discovered he could not open the post office safe because of a computer glitch.
The safe failed to open when a national computer system controlling an electronic timelock operated by the Post Office crashed. It affected hundreds of outlets across the country.
It means post offices are unable to make payments to claimants until Tuesday morning at the earliest.
Then Mr Govani will be able to recoup what he has paid out.
Mr Govani said: 'I am here to serve the public. If I hadn't acted then a lot of my customers would not have had any money.
'I know a lot of people, including pensioners, would have needed the money to buy food.
'When I knew that I wasn't going to be able to open the safe until next week, I felt I had no option but to go to the bank and withdraw money from my account.
'So I went to the bank and withdrew enough cash to pay my customers. I don't want to lose them and I felt it was the least I could do.' One customer, Sheena Shepherd, was among those handed money from Mr Govani's savings.
Mrs Shepherd said: 'I went to my own post office in Avonvale Road first and they could not give any benefits out. We then went to a post office in St George and it was the same there.
'People on Family Credit, Income Support, any kind of benefit, were affected.
'When we got to the post office at Lawrence Hill, I heard that the post master was using his own money to pay people. It was such a lovely thing to do.' Post Office spokesman Richard Hall said: 'I think it was a wonderful gesture by Sam and shows the lengths our sub-postmasters go to to make sure they provide the best service.' Around 500 sub-post offices are believed to be affected by the automatic time lock glitch.
