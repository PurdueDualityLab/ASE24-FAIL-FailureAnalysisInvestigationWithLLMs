A KIND-hearted postmaster paid out pensions and benefits with his own cash after a computer fault hit the timelock on his safe.
Sam Govani, 39, forked out to help needy folk in Lawrence Hill, Bristol.
Around 500 sub post offices were hit by the nationwide glitch.
Ugandan-born Sam said: "If I hadn't acted some of my customers would not have had money for food."
