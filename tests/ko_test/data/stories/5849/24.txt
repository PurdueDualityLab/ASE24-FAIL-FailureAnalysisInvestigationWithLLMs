After consulting rank-and-file firefighters, Pasco officials are asking county commissioners for 11 new fire rescue positions.
Pasco firefighters are often forced to drive and read maps at the same time while rocketing to a fire, says Fire Rescue Lt. James Higgins.
At the blaze, they may have to wait for a second fire engine before heading inside a burning building.
Such glitches take time, and every second is crucial in fire rescue work.
'Seconds doesn't sound like a lot, but if your house is on fire and you're standing outside, five seconds can seem like an eternity,' Higgins says.
The problem, according to Higgins and other Pasco Fire Rescue workers, is that the county's 12 fire stations often have only two firefighters working per shift. That leaves them understaffed during certain emergencies.
County officials have asked county commissioners to hire nine firefighters, one new fire lieutenant and one new rescue lieutenant nduring the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.
The new hires are part of a proposed $ 1.65 million budget increase for the Pasco Emergency Services Department, one of the largest proposed increases among county departments. The department's total budget came to $ 17.02 million this year. Commissioners will hone the proposed budget before finalizing it in late September.
The budget request comes after the firefighters and paramedics broke with Teamsters Union Local 444 in April. Shortly afterward, the county awarded raises and held meetings with the workers.
'For many years, we heard from union leaders, but we were limited in our discussions with the rank and file,' said Dan Johnson, assistant county administrator. 'One of the things they expressed an interest in is increasing staffing from a safety standpoint.'
On paper, the county's 125 firefighters can just about staff stations in shifts of three. But in reality, firefighters take vacations, train and become ill.
Higgins, who usually works out of Fire Rescue Station 10 in Hudson, said the station has three firefighters only about 50 percent of the time.
'We're hoping that with these additional people, we can have three firefighters on shift 60 to 80 percent of the time,' said Matthew Ballaban, emergency services director.
That will prevent dangerous situations, Higgins said. For instance, when a tanker must be taken to a scene, a third firefighter can ride with the fire engine driver and read maps. Also, safety procedures call for firefighters to enter burning buildings in pairs and for one to operate the engine.
'There's so much to do in emergency situations,' Higgins said. 'We always need extra hands.' John Temple covers Pasco government. Reach him at (813) 948-4220.
