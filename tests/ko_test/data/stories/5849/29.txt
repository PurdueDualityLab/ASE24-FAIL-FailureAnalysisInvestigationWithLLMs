A TECHNOLOGY specialist will meet Invercargill firefighters today as the Fire Service works to resolve glitches in its new 111 system.
Southern region fire commander Steve Turek, of Dunedin, said Fire Service information technology general manager Alan Thompson was heading a special task force responsible for investigating the glitches. Mr Thompson was already studying some of the faults highlighted by concerned firefighters.
'His role in terms of talking to firefighters is really to give them an opportunity to voice their issues with somebody face-to-face,' Mr Turek said.
In the initial weeks of the new system early last month, Invercargill firefighters recorded numerous blunders, revealing one in three call-outs was botched.
Senior station officers said they feared the problems, which included slow response times and turning out fire engines to wrong areas, could eventually prove fatal.
Their concerns prompted an audit of the Christchurch-based Southern Communications Centre.
Mr Turek pledged to publicise the ensuing report, but said yesterday Mr Thompson's broader investigation had pre-empted that.
'His job now is to look at the much wider extent of any issues and that's far more encompassing than just the initial report that was commissioned.'
The Fire Service would keep the public informed of Mr Thompson's investigation.
'It's not just a public relations exercise on his part . . . he's got quite a specific role in finding out what the issues are and, in turn, fix them.
'That . . . will, hopefully, restore the confidence of our own staff and the public,' Mr Turek said.
