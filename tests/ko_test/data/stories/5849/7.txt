INVERCARGILL firefighters have called for an independent inquiry into the new 111 system after a Fire Service audit cleared it of any major flaws.
Firefighters have yet to be briefed on the review, but yesterday the Professional Firefighters' Union said no mention had been made of crucial errors in the system.
Invercargill branch vice-president Graeme Gilroy said it would take an independent inquiry to restore the faith of the public and firefighters.
National fire commander Bob Sampson has said a meeting of Fire Service and Southern Communications Centre management on Friday revealed the communications network was working effectively.
He acknowledged faults in communication but said most calls were answered within 10 seconds.
Calls might have been answered quickly, but the major factor was how long it took for firefighters to be turned out, Mr Gilroy said.
'He hasn't addressed the issue we raised of delays and turning the respective trucks out in the respective areas and turning them out to the correct place.
'We just want the right directions in a reasonable time span so we can get on the road to that call and be able to help as well as what we've done in the past.'
The public spotlight has been cast on the Christchurch-based communications system, which now answers all South Island calls, after senior Invercargill firefighters labelled it a shambles.
A tally from the switch-over on July 5 until July 26 revealed 21 out of the 60 emergency calls were bungled, Mr Gilroy said.
While there had been few communications problems last week, firefighters still feared lives and property were being endangered.
Southern region fire commander Steve Turek, who last week pledged to publicise the review findings, left before the end of Friday's review meeting and was yesterday still waiting to speak to Mr Sampson about the final decisions. However, he believed the intention was still to publicly release the findings.
in the system were already being ironed out.
'I think you have to put a lot of things in context, too. People are out there looking for every single problem . . . things, once again, are being perhaps exaggerated . . . in terms of seriousness,' he said.
