The wrong fire brigade was initially called out to Wakefield last night. Wakefield Volunteer Fire Brigade chief fire officer Terry Douglas said there was a glitch which resulted in the Nelson Fire Service being called to a Christian camp in Bridge Valley Rd. Mr Douglas said the Nelson crew alerted the Fire Service communications centre in Christchurch that the callout was not in their zone, but in the Wakefield brigade area. The Nelson brigade received the call at 8.55pm. Mr Douglas said eventually Wakefield brigade was called out and found that burnt toast had set smoke alarms off, and the people in the camp could not turn them off.
