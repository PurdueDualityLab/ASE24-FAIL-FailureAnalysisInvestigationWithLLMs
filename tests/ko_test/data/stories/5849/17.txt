The Fire Service says no emergency calls were lost during a fault this week that meant its communications centre in Wellington had to use cellphones to alert Hawkes Bay stations.
Corporate affairs manager Jon Neilson said the fault was in the radio-relay network, not the 111 system. Emergency calls were answered as normal in Wellington.
