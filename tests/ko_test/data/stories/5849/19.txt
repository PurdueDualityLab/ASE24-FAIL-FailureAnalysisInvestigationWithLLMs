Where there
is smoke . . .
Spending $ 25 million on a new computer dispatch system, the Fire Service has established three centres for 111 calls -- Christchurch, Wellington and Auckland. There were provincial groans about the potential loss of local knowledge and the uncomfortable feeling that comes with a Timaru emergency call being answered in Christchurch.
But people, by now numb to the name of progress, protested little. There may even have been an accepting expectation of the odd teething problem.
Sending fire engines to the non-existent corner of Woollcombe and Ritchie streets in Timaru is not a teething problem, and neither really is a 10-minute delay to an ammonia spill at Sanfords. Nor, two months after the changeover, can delays of six and 14 minutes to callouts be brushed aside.
Local union chairman Gordon Ireland says the system is a complete shambles and lives are being endangered, and Auckland firefighters are just as appalled. In the last four weeks they made 150 complaints about the system, although Fire Service information technology strategy manager Alan Thompson says there had been only a few glitches. Maybe the calls are not getting through to him.
Complaints include delays in the time it takes stations to be notified, wrong stations being notified, the shared police mapping system differing to that firefighters have used, lack of operator training, and inaccuracies in the database. These are not teething problems, and given the importance of the service they should have been sorted out before commissioning.
National fire commander Bob Sampson says the problems have to be kept in perspective given that 22,500 calls have been received. He rightly says that the time spent waiting on the end of a phone to report an emergency can seem longer than it really is, and if 30 people report the same fire not all can be answered at the same time. It was unfair to compare police training on the system to that of Fire Service personnel, he said, because legal and policy training was not required by the latter, and complaints about lack of geographical knowledge by operators had also been a problem under the old system.
But where there is smoke there is fire, and Internal Affairs Minister Jack Elder has been too slow in urging the Fire Service to sort them out. Despite claims to the contrary, properties have been further damaged by delays, and firefighter confidence in the system has been eroded.
The real danger is that the public will follow suit and, in the heat of the moment, try ringing their local station instead of relying on the 111 system. That is why the 'teething problems' need to be fixed. Like, yesterday.
Give system
a chance
Doctors fearful of prosecution for implementing the new booking system are stretching things a little. Under the system, points are awarded to determine priority for operations and people without enough points are eliminated from waiting lists.
Christchurch surgeon Philip Bagshaw has written to Canterbury Health asking it to put the system on hold, expressing concern about the ethics of dropping people off lists and that doctors could be held legally liable for the deaths of any of those patients.
But if anything the new system is more ethical than the last, where people could languish seemingly forever under the misapprehension that they were nearing the top of their list. Now, they get a date for an operation within six months, or they do not qualify, but at least they know.
The community also realises that doctors can do only so much, and no-one expects every sick person to be treated at once.
