Firefighters say system flawed

SENIOR Invercargill firefighters have labelled the new 111 system a shambles, saying one in three emergency calls have been botched.
Until now, Invercargill staff have shied away from criticising the new system, under which all South Island emergency calls are answered at the Southern Communications Centre in Christchurch.
But fearing a tragedy, four of the city's most senior firefighters yesterday publicly called on the Fire Service to reactivate the communications centre in Dunedin until the new system's 'woeful performance' could be rectified.
Senior station officers Gordon Rodgers, Steven Greenyer, Bill Holvey and Geoff Patterson have written to assistant southern fire region commander Ian Pickard, of Dunedin, citing 12 bungled Invercargill calls in the first fortnight under the new system.
'In the first 14 days of operation . . . Invercargill attended 34 fire calls, of which 12 contained some comm centre error -- a failure rate of 35 percent,' the memo said.
In two cases, Invercargill firefighters were not notified of the emergency calls until seven minutes after the 111 call was made.
Major problems included:Slow response times.
Sending engines to wrong areas.
Recalling off-duty staff when they were not needed, but failing to alert them when they were.
Failure to operate station alarms, which meant staff were not notified of an emergency and the public address system through which details came was not activated.
Two of the senior station officers, who did not want to be identified individually, spoke out yesterday about the glitches and the potential for disaster.
'We're concerned that sooner or later either someone will die or someone's property will burn to the ground because the brigade hasn't been notified or notified properly,' one said.
Firefighters had been prepared for a few hiccups with the new system.
'But the teething problem is getting beyond a joke now,' the other officer said.
Both feared what would happen should there be a flurry of major incidents in the South Island.
'Multiple calls -- it's just going to blow to bits.
'If they can't get one or two calls in the area right, how big a disaster is going to happen with multiple calls?' one asked.
Fire Service corporate affairs manager John Neilson said the matter was being taken seriously.
'As I speak there is a thorough audit being carried out on all of the processes and the procedures at the comms centre in Christchurch just to validate what these guys are saying,' Mr Neilson said.
'Until that's been completed, we won't know what the order of the day is, but it's certainly being taken seriously and we welcome the input from the field.'
Mr Neilson expected the audit to be completed in two days before a report on the findings was sent to southern region fire commander Steve Turek.
