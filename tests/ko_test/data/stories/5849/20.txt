Tensions are rising between the Fire Service and its union over claims of problems with the new 111 communications system.
Firefighters' Union spokesman Jeff McCulloch has challenged the service's national commander, Bob Sampson, to prove his claims that the union's complaints were unfounded.
The union has said that under-trained operators and equipment glitches in the new communications centres were causing delays, and it was only a matter of time before someone died.
Mr McCulloch said that Mr Sampson had accused firefighters of lying about the problems they encountered. ''We are angry at the constant attempts by management to play down the serious nature of these complaints,'' he said.
Mr Sampson said the amount of criticism levelled at the new 111 system was unsubstantiated and unjustified.
''This has not only potentially discredited some of our brigades, our fire officers, and our communication centre operators, it has also seriously questioned the 111 system, thereby causing unnecessary concern to the public.''
Mr Sampson said more than 22,500 calls had been received since the cutover process began at the end of June, one-third of which were 111 calls.
''Out of such a large number of calls, it is inevitable that some will be questioned and require review,'' he said.
