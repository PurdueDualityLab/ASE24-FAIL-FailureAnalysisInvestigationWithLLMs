Fire problems 'unacceptable'

Problems at the Fire Service communications centre in Christchurch have been affecting the Nelson brigade and are unacceptable, a firefighters' union spokesman says.
New Zealand Professional Firefighters Union Nelson branch secretary Brian O'Donnell said there had been at least four recent communication glitches which had affected Nelson firefighters, since the Fire Service switched to the Southern Communications Centre in Christchurch earlier this month.
He said the problems involved firefighters being directed to the wrong street or place, not hearing any call directions, or being called out to the wrong zone, which another brigade should have been initially called to.
He said he believed part of the problem was computer-related, and the other part had to do with the extra operators employed at the communications centre.
Mr O'Donnell said he was not blaming the operators, because they had a stressful job, but he said he did not think the new ones had been trained properly.
He said it was crucial that firefighters were given correct instructions straight away, as fires became worse the longer they were left unattended.
Any problems with the communications system were being recorded by firefighters and passed on to Nelson's chief fire officer.
Fire Service Southern Communications Centre Manager David Dally refused to comment on Mr O'Donnell's claims that the new operators had not been trained properly.
Mr Dally admitted there had been problems with the new system, and there had been ''the odd error'' by operators, which were being investigated.
He said staff at the centre were doing their best to provide the best service, and he was confident the glitches were disappearing as the stability of the service improved.
Mr Dally said he was sure the problems would be sorted out with a bit of understanding and confidence from firefighters.
