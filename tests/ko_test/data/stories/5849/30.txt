The minister in charge of the fire service has told it to correct faults with the new 111 callout system.
Internal Affairs Minister Jack Elder said he had called for reports on firefighters' claims of delays and dispatch mix-ups caused by the new system.
The Auckland branch of the Professional Firefighters' Union said firefighters had made more than 150 complaints about the system in the past four weeks.
Mr Elder said he had been assured by fire service chief executive Jean Martin that the glitches stemmed from problems with the system database, not its design.
'That indicates that given a bit of time -- as little time as possible -- they can fix that,' he said. 'I am urging the fire service to put whatever it has to into the system to resolve the problems as soon as possible.'
The database problems result from the fire service moving to the police Card system for 111 callouts, which has different geographical information.
For example, in the police system the South Auckland suburb of Mangere Bridge is known as Harania East.
Mr Elder said he could not yet say whether the teething problems were unacceptably high.
Fire service national commander Bob Sampson said a tollfree number set up on August 7 for questions from staff and private fire alarm holders relating to the new 111 system had received 84 calls. -- NZPA
