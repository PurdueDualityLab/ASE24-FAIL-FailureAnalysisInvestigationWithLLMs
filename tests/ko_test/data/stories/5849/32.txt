Teething problems with the new Fire Service communications system have been ironed out, says national commander Bob Sampson.
Since the South Island Fire Service dispatching system was centralised at Christchurch just more than a month ago, it has been plagued by problems resulting in delays of up to several minutes in responding to calls.
Mr Sampson said senior Fire Service managers and commanders held a meeting in Christchurch to evaluate the new computer-aided communications network.
They found it was now operating effectively after action to resolve the ``teething problems'', he said.
Many of the complaints about the new system came from Dunedin and Invercargill firefighters.
Invercargill firefighters said one in three call-outs was botched during the first fortnight. In Dunedin there had been at least 40 calls since the system went live.
Nelson firefighters reported four communications glitches which had affected response times.
The South Island president of the Professional Firefighters Union, Steve Warner, said the delays created a potential for loss of life.
``It must be emphasised that at no time have we lost any fire calls and that appliances have responded to all incidents,'' Mr Sampson said.
Steps taken to eliminate the delays included software changes, improvements in operator skills, and upgrading the database.
The meeting revealed the need for a better mapping system used to guide appliances from the right fire station to the address where the call originated.
Mr Sampson said until an enhanced mapping system was installed, it was vital that callers clearly stated the street address, nearest crossroad or intersection, and the suburb and city.
