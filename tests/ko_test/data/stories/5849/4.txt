Concern over fire-call glitches: [2 Edition]

Delays in responding to emergency fire calls may be due to equipment or software faults, says a union leader.
Complaints of delays have flooded in since the new Fire Service Southern Communications Centre in Christchurch began taking all South Island calls on July 5.
Senior firefighters in Invercargill say one in three call-outs during the first two weeks of the new operation was botched. In Dunedin, there have been at least 40 complaints since the system went live.
Professional Firefighters' Union Nelson branch secretary Brian O'Donnell said there had been at least four recent communication glitches which had affected Nelson firefighters.
The South Island president of the union, Steve Warner, said the delays created a potential for loss of life if a delay coincided with a call to a fire where people were trapped.
It was vital to respond quickly to emergency calls as a fire could double in size every minute.
``From what I can gather there seem to be a few problems with the equipment they are using. Its design or software is just not up to standard,'' Mr Warner said.
Delays of up to four minutes in responding to some automatic alarm systems were occurring.
Mr Warner said part of the problem was due to the new centre going live before the service took delivery of associated equipment to use with it, including new radios.
These would allow status reports such as the location of fire appliances, the fact they had responded to a call, and the nature of a fire, to be recorded electronically. This would be quicker and reduce radio traffic on busy communication lines.
Communications centre manager David Dally said technical problems had affected the centre's performance, but it was ``settling down quite well''.
Technicians had been working very hard to identify whether there were any fundamental glitches in the system.
Most of the difficulties were to be expected with the move to a new system.
