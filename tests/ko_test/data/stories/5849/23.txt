TARANAKI'S emergency fire 111 call centre has not been hit by the glitches that have plagued its South Island counterpart, Fire Service officials say.
New Plymouth Fire Brigade chief fire officer Allen Pidwell said a few minor bugs were being worked through and he was happy with the way the system was running. "We have had minor hiccups on the way through, but nothing that caused any problems."
Since July 19 all Taranaki emergency 111 fire calls have been answered at the Wellington Communications Centre, which is equipped with new high-tech equipment. The old call-answering centre in Palmerston North has been closed as part of an upgrading of communications systems.
Mr Pidwell said in Taranaki things were running as smoothly as could be expected with a new system.
However, Professional Firefighters' Union Taranaki vice-president Rob Cochran said he believed there had been delays in some emergency call turn outs since the switch-over. Firefighters, who were concerned by the problems, were taking a wait and see approach.
A few minutes delay could make a big difference in fire or emergency, he said.
Luckily so far the hiccups had not had any serious repercussions, Mr Cochran said. "They are basically saying to us, as it comes on line there will be a few teething problems."
Another source, who did not wish to be named, said they did not think communications centre staff understood how firefighters worked.
Fire Service corporate affairs manager Jon Neilson said as far as he was concerned the system was working well. "There has been nothing of any major significance."
Firefighters in the South Island have reported on-going problems since their switch-over to a Christchurch call centre early in July. Problems included slow response times, turning out fire engines to wrong areas and turning out the wrong stations.
The Fire Service set up a new 0800 number yesterday which the public could ring to comment on any aspect of the new 111 system or the Fire Service. Calls would be followed up and queries answered.
