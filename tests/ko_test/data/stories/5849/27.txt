Emergency call audit findings to be public

THE southern region fire commander has pledged to make public the findings of an inquiry into the new problem-plagued emergency call centre.
Steve Turek, of Dunedin, said the audit had been completed and he expected to have initial talks with the communication centre manager today before he was fully briefed on Friday.
Mr Turek expected the findings would be released shortly after that meeting, and he said the public deserved to be reassured.
Since the July 5 switch to the new system, under which all Southland and Otago emergency fire calls are answered at the Southern Communications Centre in Christchurch, there has been a string of glitches.
The Fire Service announced the audit last week after four of Invercargill's most senior firefighters went public about their concerns, saying one in three call-outs during the first two weeks of the new operation was botched.
They feared the bungles -- which included slow response times and turning out fire engines to wrong areas -- would end in tragedy.
Yesterday, Mr Turek said he was also worried and admitted he had contemplated reactivating the Dunedin communications centre during the early days of the switch-over.
'I certainly looked at it in the early stages, but my thoughts on the matter at the moment are I don't think we've got a situation that would warrant anything quite that drastic.'
He did not believe the faults would put lives at risk and said some of the problems from the centre's early days had already been ironed out.
However, one Invercargill senior station officer, who did not want to be identified, said the frustration for firefighters continued.
Of four calls during the day shift on Saturday, three were faulty.
The most serious was a call to a car accident, which communications staff said was outside a petrol station in Alice Street, Invercargill.
Aware there were no service stations in Alice Street, but three in Elles Road, firefighters queried the information.
They were again told the address was Alice Street and told to investigate.
The accident turned out to be in Elles Road.
The officer said firefighters were given the wrong address, but also not advised of the crash until 5 minutes after the emergency call was received at the communications centre.
He rejected Mr Turek's claim the problems did not endanger lives. Failing to turn out the right station or giving the incorrect address wasted precious time.
'They have the potential to be life-threatening,' he said.
The problems were 'fundamental faults' in the system's database, which should have been checked and fixed before the system went on-line.
Mr Turek said he did not want to make excuses but new systems would inevitably have cut-over hiccups.
'We're not going to sit by and put the public in physical jeopardy. We want to make sure that the system works to its optimum to provide the service we need to provide.'
