Callout faults prompt warning

in the new 111 system could lead to deaths, a firefighters' union boss warns.
The union's Timaru branch chairman, Gordon Ireland, said delays in alerting brigades were serious and unacceptable.
The shared police and fire Communication and Resource Deployment system was not working well, and was leading to mistakes. Delays of six to 14 minutes to recent Timaru callouts had been experienced, with a 10-minute response to an ammonia leak at Sanfords at the Port of Timaru.
As well, Mr Ireland said he had heard of an instance in Temuka where the ambulance service had to call the Fire Service, and of a delay in calling firefighters to a bus crash near Geraldine.
Christchurch firefighters had been given calls to Timaru fires, and so had a Balclutha crew.
No lives had been lost because of delays, but Mr Ireland said it was just a matter of time.
He said firefighters had been labelled as inefficient, but it was the new callout system that was slack.
Mr Ireland said he spoke out about the 111 system because he wanted to protect the people and property of South Canterbury.
''We have been told not to say anything about this, but they will have to sack me to get me to be quiet,'' Mr Ireland said.
He said the delays were not people problems, but computer problems.
Information about locations was taking up to a minute to appear on computer screens.
Mr Ireland said he was not trying to cause problems, and he had expected teething problems with the new service. ''But this has been going on now for nearly two months. This is appalling.''
The Fire Service should revert to its old system, sort out the new system, and then bring it in, he said.
