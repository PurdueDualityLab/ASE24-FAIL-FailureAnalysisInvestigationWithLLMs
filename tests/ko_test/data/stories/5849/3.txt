Leaked fire memo outlines 111 fears: [1 Edition]

A leaked e-mail shows the Fire Service is concerned that technical problems with a new computer system mean 111 emergency calls may not be getting through.
In an "urgent message" from National Fire Commander Bob Sampson, widely distributed to Fire Service staff, the service says it is concerned it may miss 111 calls.
The concerns result from technical glitches as the Fire Service adopts the same computer dispatch system as the police in some areas including Wellington.
"The SITE (Shared Information Technical Environment) project is presently having some teething troubles as the computer system cuts over to the new programme," reads the e-mail, dated July 15.
"Most of the problems are technical in nature but they are causing concern amongst staff. The biggest concern is the possibility of 111 calls not getting through or fire alarms not being tranmsitted through to the Fire Service."
The memo also reveals the Fire Service is sensitive to media attention on the issue and outlines a media plan in dealing with inquiries about 111 faults.
"Local fire service personnel should not talk to the media about their concerns or respond to any questions. This is to ensure a consistent response is given to the public," the e-mail reads.
It says this is a departure from normal practice where Fire Service personnel are able to talk to the media about fire-related issues.
Labour Internal Affairs spokesman Trevor Mallard, who passed the leaked memo to The Post today, said he was concerned both that 111 calls might not be getting through and also that the service did not appear willing to let the public know about the problems.
"My principle concern now is that the public should know there are problems and they should know that if they can't get through on 111 they should ring their local fire station," he said.
"I believe they should place advertisements, similar to those that have been taken out to promote the modernisation of the Fire Service . . . saying that there are problems, so that as many people as possible are aware of it."
Mr Mallard said he did not have a problem with the merging of the 111 programme between fire and police as long as it worked.
He believed the Fire Service should talk to Telecom about having a alternative system in place if their new system failed.
"If they are likely to lose 111 calls then the responsible thing to do is to have in place a system to catch these (missed) calls," he said.
Mr Sampson conceded there were initial problems with the new service.
However, the system was now working well with 75 percent of 111 calls being answered in eight seconds, 94 percent within 16 seconds and 99 percent within 40 seconds. This compared with a target answer time of 45 seconds.
Mr Sampson said the service had not missed any 111 calls and had an arrangement with Telecom whereby an operator would stay on the line until a call was answered.
The memo was sent because of initial problems with the system which resulted in concerns from some staff.
Mr Sampson rejected Mr Mallard's criticism that the service did not want the public to know about possible problems with the new system. He said the media plan that only he would speak about the issue was designed to ensure a consistent response.
Confidence in the new service meant Palmerston North was switched over to the computer dispatch system last night and Auckland and Hamiliton were soon to follow.
