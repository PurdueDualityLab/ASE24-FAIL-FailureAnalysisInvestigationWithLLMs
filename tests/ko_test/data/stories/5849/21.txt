The Nelson Fire Brigade was mistakenly called out to a fire in Motueka late last night in the latest example of continuing problems with the Fire Service communications centre in Christchurch.
The Nelson station was called to a false alarm at the Melting Pot backpackers in Motueka just after 11pm, while five stations closer to the incident were not called.
Senior Station Officer Russell Genese of the Nelson Fire Service said it was fortunate he remembered from some months before that the hostel was in Motueka.
He said the communications centre was asked as to why Nelson had been called to the fire. Christchurch staff answered by repeating the turnout call to Nelson.
``I directed them to turn out Motueka and they did so, but there was a six to eight-minute delay,'' Mr Genese said.
``I have grave concerns about the effectiveness of the communications centre,'' he said.
The incident comes just three days after Fire Service National Commander Bob Sampson said an evaluation of the communications network confirmed it was operating effectively.
He said on Sunday that the teething problems which became evident when the system was first installed four weeks ago had been largely resolved.
At no time had any fire calls been lost and appliances had responded to all incidents.
New Zealand Professional Firefighters Union Nelson branch secretary Brian O'Donnell said there had been at least four recent communication glitches which had affected Nelson firefighters since the Fire Service switched to the southern communications centre in Christchurch early last month.
Fire Service Southern Communications Centre manager David Dally could not be contacted for comment this morning.
