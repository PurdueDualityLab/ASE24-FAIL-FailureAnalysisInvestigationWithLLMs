111 system glitches revealed in report: [1 Edition]

INVERCARGILL firefighters remain suspicious of the new 111 calling system after dealing with further glitches last week.
A report leaked to The Southland Times yesterday showed two instances where minor technical procedures had gone wrong and caused firefighters delays.
On August 2, the radio telephone went off air which meant the station's turn out call was then put through a normal telephone.
On August 5, the computer system failed to activate pagers for off duty officers to get them to return to the station for a call out.
While the errors were contained to procedural glitches in the system, firefighters are concerned a system was put in place without being fully tested.
Invercargill acting fire officer Peter Burtonwood said he could not comment on the new errors.
The Fire Service has banned staff from publicly speaking out about the system.
An Invercargill firefighter, who wanted to remain anonymous, said the over-riding concern was the minor glitches would develop into something serious and cost someone a life.
Invercargill MP Mark Peck said the public would have no confidence in the 111 system if flaws were still apparent.
Invercargill firefighters have already labelled the system a shambles.
Senior station officers in the city criticised the system in July, after problem calls that caused firefighters to have slower response times.
A Fire Service audit cleared the system of any major faults but the Invercargill firefighters want an independent inquiry.
Fire Service national commander Bob Sampson could not contacted for comment last night.
However, Mr Sampson has ordered a task force to visit the Invercargill station on Wednesday to discuss the request for an inquiry and specific requirements for the Invercargill fire district.
