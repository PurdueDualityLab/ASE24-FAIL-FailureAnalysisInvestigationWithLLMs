Further glitches in fire system

The Timaru Fire Service responded to a 111 call to Queen Street in Timaru yesterday morning, nearly five minutes after the St Andrews brigade had incorrectly been sent to Queen Street, Pareora.
The Christchurch communications centre had also asked the Temuka tanker to go to Pareora, until Temuka fire chief Colin Brokenshire pointed out there was a far closer tanker, in Timaru.
Timaru fire chief Artie Lind last night confirmed the confusion, which follows similar problems since a change to a centralised dispatch system. He has asked the communications centre manager for clarification of what had occured, and has sent a report to fire service national commander Bob Sampson.
'My concern is that where there are similar addresses in different towns. To protect the community, there needs to be a response to more than one address if it is not clear which address the call has come from.
'I do have a concern in light of last (Thursday) night's fire.' There, neighbours were alerted to the Grants Road fire by a smoke alarm and the smell of burning. Firefighters found a person asleep in the house.
'Any delays in this type of incident could have serious consequences, in terms of property damage, and stress or injury to persons.'
Mr Lind heard the St Andrews brigade dispatched at 10.05am. Several minutes later he heard the brigade's chief, Gordon Hardacre, telling the communications centre there was no fire at Queen Street, Pareora. Mr Hardacre had gone directly from work to that address.
He said last night, the communications centre was already aware the fire was not at Pareora when he radioed in. It was still some minutes later before the communications centre dispatched Timaru.
Mr Lind understood the original 111 call was triggered by a personal health alarm the occupant of the Timaru property was wearing. The smoke alarm in the house was also connected to the system. When it triggered the monitoring company alerted the fire service and St John Ambulance. The ambulance was at the property before the fire service arrived. The female occupant was not injured. Burning toast is thought to have triggered the smoke alarm.
Mr Lind would not comment further on the incident, referring The Herald instead to Mr Sampson.
Mr Sampson said the problems were caused by human rather than system error.
The call taker had come up with two streets with the same name, and had selected the wrong address. The person realised the mistake when they heard the dispatch call.
Mr Sampson said the Temuka tanker had been called because of a data error in the system which showed Temuka as the nearest available tanker.
He said problems similar to yesterday's had occurred with the previous communications system but had been covered up.
Some operators had been identified as requiring additional training, and action was being taken.
