Computer Problem Could Cause Trouble When Dow Hits 10,000; Glitch At 10,000 New Computer Worry

NEW YORK -- While the world struggles to avoid a year 2000 computer crash, a prominent technology consultant warns some Wall Street computers could go berserk once the Dow Jones industrial average crosses 10,000. The Securities and Exchange Commission and others have dismissed the warning about computer confusion once the Dow adds a fifth digit, but some information systems experts say the reaction is similar to the initial warnings of the year 2000 problem. Technology consultant Gartner Group says some Wall Street computers have old software that could read a 10,000 Dow as 1,000 or 0000, prompting automatic trading systems to sell after mistaking the all-time high as a catastrophic crash. The panic and confusion could snowball and expose investors to tremendous risks, said David Cappucio, a Gartner vice president. Gartner says it is not trying to scare up business because it is just a research and consulting firm and doesn't fix computer systems. ``We have talked to a few clients in the top 10 to 15 {financial firms} in the world who have identified the problem and are working on it,'' Cappucio said. ``We don't know how pervasive the problem is.'' The problem is similar in nature to the year 2000 bug that the Federal Reserve estimates U.S. companies will spend $50 billion to prevent. The SEC says an informal review has shown that the 10,000 Dow issue will not be significant, SEC spokesman Duncan King said. The Securities Industry Association says brokerages are prepared, and the New York Stock Exchange says its computers will not be affected. Merrill Lynch, the nation's biggest brokerage, says it is still looking at its systems, but has not found any problems yet. The test could come well before the new millennium. The Dow has been rising above 9,000 lately after crossing the milestone in April. Doubters of the warning ask why should the Dow be any more a problem than Tokyo's Nikkei Stock Average or Berkshire Hathaway stock -- both are five-digit numbers. The Standard & Poor's 500 stock average rose above 1,000 with barely a notice. Also, a 10,000 Dow test by the Chicago Board Options Exchange in early May went without a glitch, said the SEC's King. Cappucio acknowledges that many firms may already be able to handle the Dow above 10,000. But some may not. And it doesn't matter that they can handle Nikkei or Berkshire, the Dow average might be using a different computer program.
