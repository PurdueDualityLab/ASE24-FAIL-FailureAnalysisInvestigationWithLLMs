While the world struggles to avoid a year 2000 computer crash, a prominent technology consultant warns that some Wall Street computers could go berserk once the Dow Jones industrial average crosses 10,000. The Securities and Exchange Commission and others have dismissed the warning about computer confusion once the Dow adds a fifth digit, but some information systems experts say the reaction is similar to that which greeted the initial warnings of the year 2000 problem. A technology consulting firm, the Gartner Group in New York, says some Wall Street computers have old software that could read a 10,000 Dow as 1,000 or 0000, prompting automatic trading systems to sell after mistaking the all-time high for a catastrophic crash. The panic and confusion could snowball and expose investors to tremendous risks, said David Cappucio, a Gartner vice president. Gartner says it is not trying to scare up business because it is just a research and consulting firm _ and does not fix computer systems. "We have talked to a few clients in the top 10 to 15 {financial firms} in the world who have identified the problem and are working on it," Cappucio said. "We don't know how pervasive the problem is." The problem is similar to the year 2000 bug that the Federal Reserve estimates U.S. companies will spend $50 billion to solve. The SEC says an informal review has shown that the 10,000 Dow issue won't be significant, SEC spokesman Duncan King said. The Securities Industry Association says brokerages are prepared, and the New York Stock Exchange says its computers will not be affected. Merrill Lynch, the nation's biggest brokerage, says it is still looking at its systems, but has not found any problems yet. PaineWebber Inc. declined to comment about the problem, and other Wall Street firms did not return telephone calls. The test could come well before the new millennium. The Dow has been holding above 9,000 lately after crossing the milestone in April. The last time the Dow took more than a year to rise 1,000 points, it was trading at 4,000. Doubters of the warning ask why the Dow should be any more of a problem than Tokyo's Nikkei Stock Average or Berkshire Hathaway's stock price. Both are five-digit numbers. The Standard & Poor's 500 stock average rose above 1,000 with barely a notice. Also, a 10,000 Dow test by the Chicago Board Options Exchange in early May went without a glitch, said the SEC's King. The Associated Press, which supplies the Dow Jones industrial average to thousands of media outlets around the world, has tested its computer systems and found no problems generating a five-digit number. Cappucio acknowledges that many firms may be able to handle the Dow above 10,000. But some may not. And it does not matter that they can handle Nikkei or Berkshire, because the Dow average might be using a different computer program. The NYSE's software initially was unable to handle the extra digit when Berkshire stock first crossed the $10,000 mark in 1992. Financial firms are expected to pay $6 billion to prepare for the new millennium and are retooling computers to deal with a new European currency and eventually for trading in decimals. Cappucio could not say how much it might cost to fix the Dow 10,000 problem. But Peter Harris, chief executive of ADPAC, a San Francisco company that helps fix computer bugs, says the cost for an average company might be about $2 million.
