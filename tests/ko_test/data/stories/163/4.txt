A potential electrical glitch on the shuttle Discovery poses no danger to the crew but may force it to return a day early.
The problem: high pressure in one of three fuel cells that are used to produce electricity.
NASA engineers in Houston have no idea what's wrong.
``We don't know if a sensor was giving faulty readings or if it's a mechanical problem,'' says NASA's Jeff Vincent.
The crew is conserving power by turning off some display screens and backup computers, but none of the space experiments has been affected.
NASA decides Thursday whether to end the mission on Friday - one day before Discovery's planned landing at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
Shuttle flights carry enough power for the mission plus two extra days in case bad weather delays its return to Earth.
