CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. - Astronauts aboard the space shuttle Discovery were able to turn all the lights back on Wednesday after a minor problem with their electrical system was fixed, and then they spent most of their time making a movie.
But it will not be your run-of-the-mill flick.
A 70mm IMAX camera has been turned toward the Earth throughout the five-day flight as part of an effort to document environmental degradation around the planet. The project is a collaboration between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum.
The cameras, which have been flown on several past missions, produce dramatic films that are shown with special projectors and wraparound screens.
"On these night passes, every once in a while you'll have a long chain of thunderstorms and you'll see a chain of lightning just set off like a string of firecrackers," Discovery Cmdr. Michael Coats told Mission Control in Houston.
So far, the camera has captured images including forest fires in the Big Bend National Park in Texas, flooding in Peru, the destruction of a coral reef off East Africa, fire damage in the Florida Everglades, drought in South Africa and damage in Jamaica from Hurricane Gilbert.
The five astronauts aboard Discovery got the best news of the day when they were told that engineers at the Johnson Space Center in Houston had figured out what caused one of three fuel cells aboard the craft to act erratically.
The fuel cells are used to generate electricity to run everything on board the spacecraft, and the loss of one had forced the astronauts to turn off a few lights and shut down all unnecessary equipment.
But after the problem was determined to be a sticky valve, which was freed, the third fuel cell was turned back on, eliminating the threat of having to end the mission a day earlier than had been planned.
The shuttle is scheduled to land at Edwards Air Force Base in Southern California on Saturday at 8:34 a.m. Austin time.
Discovery is piloted by John Blaha. Mission specialists are James Buchli, Robert Springer and James Bagian.
Discovery was launched Monday morning, the nation's 28th shuttle mission and the third since the 1986 Challenger accident. Its main mission, deployment of a new communications satellite on Monday, was a success.
Although it is still being checked out, the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite seems to be performing perfectly, NASA said.
Once the satellite is operational about three months from now, it and one launched last September by Discovery will provide radio communication between shuttles and Earth for 85 percent of each orbit.
