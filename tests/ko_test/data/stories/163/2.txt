CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. - Erratic fluctuations on the pressure-sensor of a hydrogen tank Tuesday prompted the crew of the space shuttle Discovery to take energy-conserving measures and raised the possibility that their planned five-day mission would be shortened a day.
As a precautionary measure, the astronauts shut off the tank, one of three that feed liquid hydrogen to the shuttle's power-producing fuel cells. The crew turned off most lights and shut down one computer and video display terminal, along with the galley's water heater and oven fan.
Based on data relayed between the shuttle and the Mission Control Center at the Johnson Space Center, "the pressure signature is something we have never seen before," said Granvil Pennington, orbit flight director. He stressed that the situation represented no danger to the five astronauts.
Late Tuesday afternoon, Mission Control commentator Billie Deason said officials planned to turn the hydrogen tank on again this morning using only one of its two heaters.
Deason said it appeared that the pressure problems stemmed from the use of both heaters, and should be alleviated by using only one.
Engineers at mission control at the Johnson Space Center in Houston were working last night to determine if the problem is a defective sensor or a problem within the hydrogen tank. If the tank itself is the source of the problem, the mission will be shortened.
If the mission is cut back to four days, the shuttle would return to Edwards Air Force Base in California on Friday morning instead of Saturday. Pennington said the crew would need a half-day to prepare for an early shuttle landing.
The fuel cells create electricity from the chemical reation of cold hydrogen and oxygen. The fuel cell power plants generate heat and water as byproducts of electrical power generation. Each cell has separate hydrogen and oxygen tanks.
Using two of the three fuel cells, the Discovery crew was able to perform all of its planned activities.
Using a 70-mm IMAX camera, the crew filmed deforestation in Africa, notably the Betsiboka River delta in northwest Madagascar, parts of Lake Chad and the Niger River delta, and the Angola coastal region. They also photographed forest fires in the Big Bend National Park and the Peruvian coast. The film will be used for a documentary on the Earth's environment.
The astronauts also began evaluating a cooling system for the proposed space station and performed some tests.
Despite the concern over pressure fluctuations in the hydrogen tank, Pennington said, the flight was reported going smoothly.
The Discovery crew began the day by waking up at 3:57 a.m., to the sound of James Brown singing I Feel Good. After some exercises and breakfast, the crew demonstrated a new text and graphics system used to gather data from Houston.
