JOHNSON SPACE CENTER Knight ridder Tribune News Service - A problem with a hydrogen tank aboard the space shuttle Discovery forced its astronauts to conserve energy Tuesday and threatened to shorten the mission, but Mission Control said there was no threat to the crew.
The five crew members monitored scientific experiments and photographed environmental damage on the Earth, a day after they roared into orbit and launched a key NASA communications satellite.
The problem was an erratic pressure reading in one of three hydrogen tanks and in its manifold, which carries the hydrogen to fuel cells. The hydrogen is combined with oxygen in the fuel cells to produce electricity for shuttle systems, with water as a byproduct.
"There are no safety problems associated with it and no electrical problems," ground control capsule communicator Mike Baker told the astronauts.
NASA flight director Chuck Shaw said Tuesday night that ground controllers hoped to solve the problem by turning the tank back on about 9 a.m. today using only one of its two heaters.
Shaw said a similar erratic reading on the same hydrogen tank was noticed on Discovery's flight last fall, but said there had been no fluctuation noted on the manifold reading.
The erratic reading, he said, was believed to be associated with how the hydrogen is heated and then pushed out of the tank to the fuel cells.
Earlier Tuesday, flight director Granvil Pennington said that if the problem couldn't be resolved and Discovery had to continue to use only two hydrogen tanks, the shuttle may land Friday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., instead of Saturday.
"Right now, we're still planning to land on Saturday," Pennington said. He said NASA could wait as late as Thursday before deciding to end the mission a day early.
Without that third tank, the shuttle might not have electricity to support a five-day flight plus two days for any contingencies.
The other two hydrogen tanks continued feeding the shuttle's fuel cells and the crew took steps to save electricity. Unnecessary lights were turned off as well as some redundant computers and two data display screens.
After the "powering down" Tuesday morning, the crew continued with planned tasks.
On Monday, several hours after Discovery's liftoff, the crew members completed their primary task - deployment of a $100 million Tracking Data and Relay Satellite to complete a communications network that will allow shuttle astronauts to have nearly constant contact with Mission Control.
During the afternoon, NASA television showed spectacular footage of the Hawaiian Islands taken by a camera in the payload bay. They also photographed forest fires in the Big Bend National Park and the Peruvian coast. Later, shots of a moon glowing in the black sky and lightning around the Earth could be seen.
Early Tuesday, ground controllers awakened the crew by playing James Brown's rowdy song, I Got You (I Feel Good).
