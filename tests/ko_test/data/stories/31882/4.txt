A BIG-HEARTED postmaster used pounds 17,000 of his own money to ensure pensioners had cash when a computer glitch froze their pensions.
Hugh Donnelly, 47, took the cash from his own bank account rather than send hundreds of pensioners away empty handed.
His elderly customers would have been left without money until Wednesday after the crisis hit 500 post offices across the UK.
Technical problems had prevented staff from opening safes on timers. But rather than let his customers face a Hogmanay with no money, Hugh raced to his bank.
The postmaster, who also runs a convenience store in Harthill, Lanarkshire, played down his generosity.
He said: 'When my customers came in, I looked at them and thought this could be my mother or gran.
'I would hate to be in that position, especially at this time of year.
'Many would have been left without cash until Wednesday and wouldn't have been able to buy even the basics. My wife Diane and I decided we would take the money out of our account.
'The Post Office has taken a bit of a battering lately and I hope we have restored people's faith a little bit.'
Customers were unaware he was handing out his own money to pay pensions, child benefit and savings accounts.
Locals last night said Hugh had probably helped prevent a miserable New Year for some pensioners.
Hugh's mother-in-law Sarah Williamson, who is also one of his customers, said: 'He is very generous and well thought of but no one knew he was handing out his own money.
'Hugh has only been sub-postmaster for six months and I know customers will thank him when they discover what he has done.'
Harthill councillor Charles Cefferty said: 'I know Hugh well and this is typical of his generosity.'
Jess Barrow, of Age Concern Scotland, was impressed by Hugh's kind action but 'appalled' at the Post Office crisis.
She said: 'It's shocking that people all over the UK were left without pensions at this time of year.'
