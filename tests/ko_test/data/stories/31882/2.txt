Around 500 Post Office branches across the country have experienced technical problems stopping customers withdrawing money.
A glitch with the computer system controlling the opening and closing of safes affected many branches throughout Friday.
Harjit Gill, owner of the Barton Street post office, said he was had to turn customers away because of the malfunction. It meant they were left without money that may have been needed to last the whole of the New Year holiday.
A Post Office spokesman said it is hoped the system would be back up and running when business resumed tomorrow.
"The safes are controlled by a central computer and we don't know what is going on," said Mr Gill. "It's had a big effect."
A spokesman for Post Office Ltd said: "We are trying to resolve the situation as quickly as possible.
"The problem is affecting only a small proportion of our network and customers can use alternative branches.
"It will be resolved when branches reopen on Tuesday after the New Year holiday.
