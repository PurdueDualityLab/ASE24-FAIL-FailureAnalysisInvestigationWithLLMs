MIDDLEWICH town centre's post office was unable to hand over cash to pensioners on New Year's Eve after a technical glitch caused problems with the safe.
Staff at the Wheelock Street branch were unable to give money to people claiming their pensions on Friday because they could not open the safe where the money is kept and, as a result, the post office was forced to close for the day.
Graham Moore, spokesman for Post Office Ltd, said there had been a technical problem with the timer mechanism at a number of post offices across the north west.
Ashmita Solanki, who runs the Cledford Post Office in Warmingham Lane, said that although their safe had not been affected, they had also experienced difficulties in the morning when the computer system would not work.
She said: "We're connected to a main hub and there was a problem with the main computer. We could not hand out benefits."
Because of the problem at Middlewich Post Office, Mrs Solanki said she had noticed more pensioner customers than usual.
She said: "We didn't have a problem with our safe so it was fortunate we could hand out pensions."
Pam Farrell, who works at Bembridge Court housing association for elderly people, said she was surprised that a better contingency plan had not been put in place.
She said: "You would have thought they could have put a bus on as a goodwill gesture, the Cledford Post Office is a good walk away from Wheelock Street."
Post Office Ltd apologised for any inconvenience and as the Guardian went to press said technicians had been working on the problem and that business was due to resume as normal yesterday, Tuesday.
