HUNDREDS of Scots were unable to collect their Hogmanay pension from post offices yesterday because of a computer glitch. They have been left without money until Wednesday after 500 post offices across the UK were hit by cash problems.
Post offices were forced to turn away customers after technical problems prevented staff from opening safes on timers.
And there was a second problem, with money not being transferred to accounts by the Department for Work and Pensions.
Post Office chiefs said 500 out of 16,000 UK offices were affected by the glitches.
The neighbour of one pensioner in Bo'ness in West Lothian said she had no money until the post offices reopened on Wednesday.
He said: 'They told her the money wasn't through from the DWP and it was a national problem.
'She was told to come back on Wednesday but five days is a long time without money.
'Some don't have family or people close by to help them out and will spend Hogmanay alone and worried sick without cash.
'Most have spent all their money over Christmas and are relying on it.'
A spokeswoman for Post Office Ltd apologised to customers and said they were working on problems at 500 branches.
She said: 'A small number of branches have experienced difficulties following a technical problem with their safe's timer.'
The pensions department admitted there were also a problem with funds not being electronically transferred to offices, but they insisted emergency payment arrangements were in place at job centres and social work offices.
Anyone with problems accessing their pension can contact the Post Office Ltd helpline on 08457223344.
