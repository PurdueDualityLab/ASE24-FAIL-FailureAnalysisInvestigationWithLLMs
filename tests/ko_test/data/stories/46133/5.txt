A DEFIANT Paul Hogan has scored a big victory in his tax fight, with the Australian Crime Commission ready to stump up millions of taxpayer dollars to pay his legal bills.
In a humiliating backdown, the commission has returned tens of thousands of the Crocodile Dundee star's personal financial documents.
They were seized from his accountants as part of the ACC's investigation into claims he hid millions of dollars in a complex web of overseas trusts. In another bungle, many of the documents were mistakenly deleted from the commission's top secret database because of a technical glitch, lawyers for the commission said in the Federal Court yesterday.
A relaxed Hogan, 69, back on home turf in Sydney to promote his new movie Charlie&Boots, said he hated bullies.
``I'm waiting for the feds to come and grab me,'' he joked to a packed media conference. Across town in the Federal Court, his barrister Francois Kunc, SC, accused the ACC of spending ``extraordinary'' amounts of money in a pointless fight over the documents.
Neither Hogan nor his business consultant Tony Stewart has been charged despite a continuing five-year investigation.
