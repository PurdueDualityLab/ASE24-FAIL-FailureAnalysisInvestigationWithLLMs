Tax case clowns humbled by Hoges

A DEFIANT Paul Hogan has scored a major victory in his tax fight with the Australian Crime Commission being forced to stump up millions of taxpayer dollars to pay his legal bills.
In a humiliating backdown, the ACC has returned tens of thousands of personal financial documents to the Crocodile Dundee star.
They were seized from his accountant as part of the commission's investigation into claims he hid millions of dollars in a complex web of overseas trusts.
In another major bungle, many of the documents were mistakenly deleted from the commission's top secret database because of a technical glitch.
Hogan's tax case was fought out in the Federal Court yesterday while Hogan, 69, relaxed just a few hundred metres away at the Intercontinental Hotel during promotional duties for his new movie.
``I'm waiting for the feds to come and grab me,'' he joked.
His barrister, Francois Kunc SC, accused the ACC of spending ``extraordinary'' amounts of money in a pointless fight.
Neither Hogan nor his business consultant Tony Stewart have been charged despite an ongoing five-year investigation by the ACC as part of its multi-million dollar Operation Wickenby.
The documents, including some from Hogan's accountants Ernst and Young, were seized three years ago. Hogan claimed legal privilege over them.
Mr Kunc said the commission had made the ``extraordinary admission'' it fought the case despite deciding three years ago that the documents were irrelevant.
The ACC has agreed to pay some of Hogan's legal costs going back to 2006, which estimates put at up to $5 million.
The ACC has already spent at least $5 million investigating
Hogan and confirmed yesterday that it had not yet finished.
Barrister for the commission, Tim Game SC, said it had done nothing improper or illegal and the investigation was ``ongoing''.
He said Hogan's application to exclude those who viewed the documents from the investigation, including two from the Australian Taxation Office, would cripple the authority's efforts.
``The investigation continues and a number of years of collective knowledge would be lost,'' Mr Game said.
Justice Arthur Emmett yesterday adjourned the case to December 8, when ACC investigator Ian Andrew, who has headed the Hogan inquiry, may be required to give evidence.
