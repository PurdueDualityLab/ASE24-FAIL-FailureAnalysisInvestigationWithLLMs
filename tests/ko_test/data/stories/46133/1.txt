A DEFIANT Paul Hogan has scored a major victory in his tax fight as the Australian Crime Commission is ready to stump up millions of taxpayer dollars to pay his legal bills.
The commission, in a humiliating backdown, has returned thousands of the Crocodile Dundee star's personal financial documents.
They were seized from his accountants in the commission's investigation into claims Hogan hid millions of dollars in a complex web of overseas trusts.
In another major bungle, many of the documents mistakenly were deleted from the commission's top-secret database because of a technical glitch, lawyers for the commission admitted in the Federal Court yesterday.
A relaxed Hogan, 69, back in Sydney to promote his new movie Charlie & Boots, said he hated bullies.
``I'm waiting for the feds to come and grab me,'' he said.
