Legal bill win for Hogan in long tax battle

A DEFIANT Paul Hogan has scored a major victory in his tax fight -- the Australian Crime Commission is ready to pay millions of taxpayer's dollars to cover his legal bills.
And, in a humiliating backdown, the commission has returned tens of thousands of the Crocodile Dundee star's personal financial documents. They were seized from his accountants as part of the commission's investigation into claims he hid millions of dollars in a complex web of overseas trusts.
In another major bungle, many of the documents were mistakenly deleted from the commission's secret database because of a technical glitch, lawyers for the commission admitted in the Federal Court yesterday.
Hogan, 69, in Sydney to promote his new movie, Charlie & Boots, which begins shooting on November 3, said he hated bullies.
``I'm waiting for the feds to come and grab me,'' he joked to a packed media conference at the Intercontinental Hotel.
Across town in the Federal Court, his barrister, Francois Kunc, SC, accused the ACC of spending extraordinary amounts of money in a pointless fight over the documents.
Neither Hogan nor his business consultant, Tony Stewart, have been charged -- despite an ongoing five-year investigation by the ACC as part of its multi-million dollar Operation Wickenby.
The documents, including some from Hogan's accountants Ernst and Young, were seized three years ago.
Hogan claimed legal privilege over them.
Mr Kunc said the commission had made the ``extraordinary admission'' that it fought the case despite deciding three years ago that the documents were irrelevant to its investigation.
The ACC has agreed to pay some of Hogan's legal costs going back to 2006, which estimates put at up to $5 million. The ACC has already spent at least $5 million investigating Hogan and it confirmed yesterday that it had not finished yet.
Justice Arthur Emmett yesterday adjourned the case to December 8, when ACC investigator Ian Andrew, who has headed the Hogan inquiry, may be required to give evidence.
