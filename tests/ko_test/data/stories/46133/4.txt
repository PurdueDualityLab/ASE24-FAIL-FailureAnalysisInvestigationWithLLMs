PAUL Hogan has scored a big victory in his fight with the taxman -- the Australian Crime Commission is ready to stump up millions of dollars to pay his legal bills.
In a humiliating backdown, the commission has returned tens of thousands of the actor's financial documents.
They were seized from his accountants three years ago as part of a probe into claims he hid millions of dollars in a web of overseas trusts.
Hogan claimed legal privilege over the documents.
Many were mistakenly deleted because of a technical glitch, lawyers for the commission admitted before Justice Arthur Emmett in the Federal Court yesterday.
Hogan's lawyers argued that anyone who viewed any of 35 seized documents should be excluded from taking part in further investigations.
Barrister Tim Game, SC, for the ACC, said Hogan's application to exclude those who viewed the papers would cripple the authority's efforts.
The ACC said outside court yesterday's move didn't affect its wider Operation Wickenby probe of tax fraud and evasion, and money laundering.
The ATO would not comment. But a relaxed Hogan, 69, back on home turf for a new movie, was not so discreet, saying he hated bullies.
``I'm waiting for the feds to come and grab me. It would be great publicity for the movie,'' he joked.
The ACC has agreed to pay some of Hogan's legal costs going back to 2006, estimated at up to $5 million. The ACC has spent at least $5 million investigating Hogan.
Mr Game said it had done nothing improper and the investigation was continuing. Justice Emmett adjourned the case to December 8.
Hogan, who begins filming Charlie & Boots in Warrnambool on Monday, also spoke about tourism promotions. The ``Where The Bloody Hell Are You?'' campaign had been embarrassing, and the new Australia-based series ``doesn't set me on fire''.
The star of the successful 1980s ``Throw Another Shrimp on the Barbie'' campaign said promoting scenery rather than people was a mistake.
``They missed the whole point. Hospitality was what we were selling,'' he said.
