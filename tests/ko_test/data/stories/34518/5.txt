WASHINGTON (AP) - D-C tax officials are blaming a computer glitchfor tax bills that went out to 59-hundred homeowners last week, incorrectly stating that they were late on their payments and owed additional fines and interest.
Tax officials tell theWashington Post that the mix-up affects only customers of Countrywide Financial Corporation and First American Real Estate Tax Service. Those companies sent their customers' payments in on time, but did not pick up on the city's new system for matching properties with tax bills.
Revised bills with the correct numbers should start showing up in the mailboxes of affected homeowners this weekend.
The director of the city's Real Property Tax Administration says most property owners don't need to do a thing.
