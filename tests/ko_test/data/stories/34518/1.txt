Officials in the District of Columbia blamed a computer glitchfor property tax bills that were sent to residents with incorrect penalties and interest. The Washington Post reports that 5,900 residents last week received invoices with a 10 percent fine and two months' interest. Officials directed homeowners to ignore the bills. "Most property owners don't have to do a thing," said Martin Skolnik, director of the city's Real Property Tax Administration. Mortgage companies Countrywide Financial and First American Real Estate Tax Service apparently did not enter the correct control numbers for the city's new system by its mailing deadline, producing the error. The mistake has been fixed, Skolnik said.
