Many visited N.H. unemployment offices over weekend
MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Hundreds of people took advantage of open unemployment offices over the weekend in New Hampshire.
Offices in Concord, Manchester, Nashua, Salem and Somersworth are staying open on weekends through September to ease a backlog in people filing claims.
Computer glitches and understaffing have led to long waits that Gov. John Lynch says are unacceptable.
The Concord office was busiest on Saturday, with 143 people, most of them just laid off at Precision Technology in Pembroke, filing claims.
Mass. municipal worker struck and killed
ATTLEBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Police say an Attleboro water department worker has been struck and killed by a motorist while working at the side of a city street.
Police say 35-year-old Jeffrey Burgess was struck at about 8 a.m. on Monday, and taken to Sturdy Memorial Hospital where he was pronounced dead.
Authorities say the worker was closing the gate on a water main near a department pickup truck that had its yellow lights flashing when he was struck by a minivan driven by a 58-year-old woman.
The driver of the minivan, identified as Ngoc Hue of Pawtucket, R.I., was taken to the hospital.
The accident remains under investigation and no charges have been filed.
N.H. suing to protect locked out workers
CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- A New Hampshire judge is temporarily blocking Precision Technology from transferring assets that could be used to provide workers compensation they are owed.
Gov. John Lynch said Monday that the state sought the order to protect the 131 workers the Pembroke company locked out last week without the federally required 60-day notice. Lynch said it appears the company broke the law by not providing notice or severance pay.
He said workers are still owed paychecks and have been unable to enter the building to retrieve personal belongings.
Lynch said trucks were seen at the company ready to move equipment out. He said the order prevents that until a formal hearing is held Sept. 10.
Gov. Patrick to have hip replacement surgery
BOSTON (AP) -- Gov. Deval Patrick is having hip replacement surgery to help alleviate pain from arthritis and an injury he suffered three decades ago.
The 53-year-old Democrat will enter Massachusetts General Hospital on Tuesday for the procedure he announced in early August.
Patrick said Monday he expects to hand over power to Lt. Gov. Tim Murray for a day or two.
Patrick injured his hip in a truck accident in 1978 while he was working on a United Nations youth training project in the Darfur region of Sudan. He said earlier that he decided to have the surgery well ahead of his re-election campaign next year.
Patrick said he expects to begin physical therapy within a few days. He'll need crutches for about three weeks, then expects to switch to a cane for a while.
N.H. wood pellet distributor growing
GOFFSTOWN, N.H. (AP) -- A New Hampshire-based wood pellet distributor has completed an $11 million financing to continue its expansion through research and development and other initiatives.
WoodPellets.com in Goffstown, founded in 2006, is looking to make wood pellets available via bulk delivery, so that wood pellet heat is as easy for homeowners to obtain as oil or gas.
The financing was accomplished with investment firms Monitor Clipper Partners and .406 Ventures.
Maine investigating hepatitis A outbreak
AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) -- The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention says one person has died and at least five others have been sickened by an outbreak of hepatitis A on Swan's Island.
Dr. Dora Anne Mills says Tuesday that all of six victims as well as four others suspected of contracting the disease stayed in the same island home, though not necessarily at the same time. She identified the victims as being from the Midwest and Middle Atlantic states.
Mills says the source of hepatitis A is unclear. She says the home had a problem with its septic system and nearby clam flats were shut down as a precaution.
Mills says one of the keys to preventing it is good hygiene. Hepatitis A is spread through unsanitary conditions, through saliva or fecal contamination.
Men accused of robbing N.H. cabbie, gas station
NASHUA, N.H. (AP) -- Police in Nashua, N.H., say two men have been accused of robbing a gas station and a city cab driver at gunpoint.
Twenty-year-old Patrick Bellino and 17-year-old Ernest Lefebvre each face two counts of robbery and falsifying evidence. Twenty-year-old Randi Gifford was charged as an accomplice with criminal liability to robbery.
All three were arrested early Sunday morning as police investigated a report that a cab driver had been robbed.
Bellino and Lefebvre were unable to post $50,000 bail, and were to be arraigned Monday. Gifford was released on personal recognizance pending arraignment Sept. 9.
Gloucester tackles water crisis
GLOUCESTER, Mass. (AP) -- City and state officials are meeting in Gloucester to discuss the city's water crisis.
Residents on Monday entered the 11th day of a boil order after increased levels of total coliform bacteria was found in the city's water supply on Aug. 21.
Mayor Carolyn Kirk is meeting with state environmental officials as well as representatives of the company that runs the city's water treatment plants on Monday to develop a plan of action. School starts in the city on Tuesday.
Deputy Fire Chief Miles Schlichte says residents only need to boil water if they intend to drink it, use it in food preparation and teeth brushing. The water can still be used for laundry, showering and other purposes. He says additional chlorine is being added to the water as well.
