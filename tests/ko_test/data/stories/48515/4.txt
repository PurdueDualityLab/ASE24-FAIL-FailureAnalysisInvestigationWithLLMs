CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. ? Space shuttle Discovery?s astronauts steered closer to the international space station for a linkup today, while checking their ship for any signs of launch damage. The routine survey began early Saturday evening and lasted well into the night. NASA officials said no fuel tank debris was observed hitting Discovery during Friday?s midnight liftoff. But the shuttle?s most vulnerable areas ? the wings and nose ? still needed to be checked with lasers and cameras on a boom attached to the robot arm. The images were beamed down for analysis.
S. Carolina: Sanford affair
Republican legislators fumed Saturday over Gov. Mark Sanford?s affair and questionable travel, though they stopped short of trying to force his resignation or impeachment before they return to the Statehouse in January. Still, the House GOP Caucus that dominates the lower chamber with 73 of the body?s 124 members made two things clear ? they want Sanford gone and they want to act soon. However, lawmakers are waiting to make any decisions until the state ethics commission finishes its investigation.
N. Hampshire: Jobless aid
The state is opening five unemployment offices this weekend to ease the backlog of people filing claims. Computer glitches and understaffing has led to long waits that the governor said are unacceptable. Offices in Concord, Manchester, Nashua, Salem and Somersworth were to be open Saturday and today to deal with the backlog. Last month, New Hampshire?s unemployment rate was 6.8 percent, 3 points higher than July, 2008.
Kansas: Abortion slaying
The suspect in the killing of abortion provider George Tiller is in talks with a prominent attorney who represents anti-abortion protesters and has long advocated justifiable homicide as a legal defense in such cases. Scott Roeder, 51, has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and aggravated assault charges in the May 31 shooting death of Tiller in the foyer of his Wichita church. The Kansas City, Mo., man has said that Tiller?s killing was justified to save ?the lives of unborn children.?
Massachusetts: Grave theft
Police said a Sudbury man stole a skull, jaw and other bones after breaking into several 19th-century burial vaults at two cemeteries. Leonard Caira was arrested Friday after officers found human bones at his home. Caira, 26, has been charged with wanton destruction of property, wanton or malicious defacement of a tomb and violating interment. He was released without bail but ordered to stay away from human remains, burglar?s tools and cemeteries.
Comoros: 2nd black box found
Authorities on Saturday recovered the second of two black boxes from a Yemenia Airways flight that crashed into the Indian Ocean last June with 153 people aboard, an official said. The director of a crisis unit set up to deal with the crash said the plane?s voice recorder had been handed to a team investigating the crash. The Airbus A310?s flight?s data recorder was recovered using a remote-controlled robot the previous day. A Red Cross coordinator said teams will continue to work for another two weeks to try to bring up wreckage and look for more bodies and luggage. Around 37 bodies have been recovered so far.
Afghanistan: Brown visits
Britain?s prime minister paid a surprise visit Saturday to British troops in Afghanistan, promising more help to cope with Taliban insurgents who have inflicted casualties on the embattled force and undercut support in Britain for the war. Prime Minister Gordon Brown, at the British base in Lashkar Gah, pledged to provide more equipment to help overcome the threat of Taliban roadside bombs, a major threat to NATO forces. More than 200 British soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan since the war began in 2001 ? more than Britain lost in the Iraq conflict.
Mexico: New ?Thriller? record
Thousands of Mexicans claimed they broke the record for most people dancing to ?Thriller? simultaneously in one place on Saturday, which would have been Michael Jackson?s 51st birthday. ?We did it!? an organizer shouted to thousands of people wearing black fedoras, white gloves, aviator shades and ghoulish face paint, breathless after trying to recreate the groundbreaking 1983 video. The current record was set in May by a group of 242 College of William & Mary students who performed the routine in Williamsburg, Virginia, according to Guinness. The organizer said 12,937 people danced Saturday in front of Mexico City?s Monument of the Revolution.
