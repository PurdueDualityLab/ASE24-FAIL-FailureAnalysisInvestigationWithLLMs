Some NH unemployment offices open on weekends

Sep. 1--SALEM -- Unemployment offices are still swamped with hundreds of claims delayed since the state rolled out a new computer system Aug. 17.
The problems haven't affected everyone. Many people have been receiving benefits within seven days. But at least 2,000 people have been waiting since the end of July to collect their unemployment checks, according to Darrell Gates, deputy commissioner with New Hampshire Employment Security.
Among them was Salem's Patricia Lakos, who has been collecting unemployment since January. She said she usually filed weekly claims online, but found herself one of hundreds of people locked out of benefits when the computer rejected her new password. She went four weeks without an unemployment check. Yesterday, Lakos finally reached a counselor who solved the glitch.
'The biggest problem has been the password,' said Diane Gagnon, employer services representative at NH Works in Salem.
Over the weekend, programmers simplified the entry system, and the staff has been able to reset hundreds of passwords.
'We're doing the best we can,' Gagnon said.
She added that the system will eventually speed up benefits for people.
Roberta Gabriel, manager of the Salem employment office, estimated 300 people came to the office on Aug. 18 and perhaps a couple of hundred every day since.
To catch up and clear the backlog, the state has decided to keep the Salem office open on weekends. Concord, Manchester, Nashua and Somersworth will stay open on weekends, too, Gates said.
Although the computer glitch started the backlog, Gates said staff shortages and the high number of unemployed have contributed to the problems.
About 28,000 unemployed people are collecting benefits in New Hampshire, he said, and many of them want to go to the unemployment office on a daily basis.
'Our labor resources and technical systems are certainly challenged with the number of unemployed,' he said.
Human error -- unfamiliarity with the new system -- caused the first problem with benefit checks, he said.
Gates said the system that prints the checks is separate from the big computer, and about 1,000 checks were never printed because a computer operator misread a file.
The same mistake, which basically caused the system to stop the batch halfway, also caused the system to print 1,000 checks twice.
'That was our first hiccup,' he said. 'That really caused a lot of disruption because once an individual knew a lot of people didn't get a check, the immediate reaction was, 'Is it me?''
Gates said the initial password setup, which called for 10 characters in a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters, proved too complicated.
'It was complex,' he said, for security, but people couldn't crack the combinations.
'We were able to get people through the first week,' he said, 'and in the second week, a group forgot the password.'
The new password is a combination of six letters and numbers, he said, and counselors are encouraging people to pick passwords they can remember.
Lakos said she made sporadic, but frustrating, trips to the Salem unemployment office, where lines out to the curb were a rarity until the state cut over to the new computer system. She said she spent four weeks trying to sweat out the lines outside the Salem unemployment office. She waited up to 90 minutes and had to give up every time, she said.
Yesterday, the afternoon line was cleared in about 10 minutes. A steady stream of cars pulled up to the unemployment office yesterday. But the lines were shorter than last week and moved faster, several people said.
'Do you need a password reset?' asked Nicole Tessier, an employment interviewer, moving briskly around the office with new pass codes.
Ken Spina of Salem walked by with a clipboard and paperwork on his way to see a worker. His check was delayed three weeks, but he was all set now, he said.
Manuel Vasquez of Lawrence, Mass., also reported his issue had been solved.
'I had a little problem last week,' he said, 'but they fixed it.'
