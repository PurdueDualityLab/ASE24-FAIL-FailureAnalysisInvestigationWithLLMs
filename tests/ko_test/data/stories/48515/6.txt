New Hampshire is opening five unemployment offices around the state this weekend to ease the backlog of people filing claims.
Computer glitches and understaffing has led to long waits that Gov. John Lynch says are unacceptable.
Offices in Concord, Manchester, Nashua, Salem and Somersworth will be open Saturday and Sunday to deal with the backlog.
The state call center also will be staffed.
Last month, New Hampshire's unemployment rate was 6.8 percent, 3 points higher than July of 2008.
