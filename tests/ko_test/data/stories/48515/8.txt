State making headway on claim backlog

Sep. 4--CONCORD -- Progress is being made on the backlog of citizens needing help at unemployment offices while unemployment numbers in New Hampshire remained steady in July.
To continue dealing with the backlog, the offices will remain open on weekends for most of September, state officials said.
Employment Security Commissioner Tara Reardon confirmed that Nashua and four other communities would for the second straight weekend keep offices open on Saturday and Sunday.
"Employment Security employees, assisted by workers from other state agencies, are working to resolve the backlog of claims that resulted from problems with a new computer system and a large volume of cases," Reardon said Thursday.
"We have significantly reduced the waiting time at these offices and will continue our efforts to minimize delays."
Gov. John Lynch is pleased to see the weekend opening of offices plus the deployment last week of state workers from other state agencies to help DES has made a difference, his spokesman said.
"We knew going in that we were looking at a situation that would probably take a month to be fully resolved," said Lynch press secretary Colin Manning.
The offices in Nashua, Manchester, Concord and Somersworth will be open from 8 a.m.-5 p.m. both weekend days. All state offices are closed Monday for the Labor Day holiday.
"I think the combination of the weekend hours and the help we have gotten from others has really helped us significantly," said Deputy Commissioner Darrell Gates.
"One key is it's given us enough time so we can fully communicate with people who are having difficulties about why it could take some time to deal with a problem."
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the New England unemployment rate in July of 8.6 percent was at its highest since November 1976.
The national unemployment mark in July was 9.4 percent.
Jobless claims in New Hampshire remained unchanged at 6.8 percent, but that figure is nearly double the same month a year ago.
Vermont was one of only two states in the country (along with Minnesota) that saw its jobless rate fall.
Rhode Island is the only state in the region with a higher unemployment than the national average and ranked second highest in the nation last month at 12.7 percent.
The state's unemployment system faced a triple whammy that led to the crunch of people waiting for help: unprecedented rising unemployment, a new computer system and a glitch in the phone network that was putting consumers on interminable hold.
Two weeks ago, 2,700 unemployed workers who were using the Internet to log in and file claims were shut out of the system due to difficulty entering their proposed passwords. The backlog was cut last week to 2,000.
The state's information technology agency has carved out a simple, five-character password alternative for those having trouble with the original version.
"Letting people reset their passwords has really helped us," Gates added. "At least now they can get into the system."
The most difficult cases to resolve are those that employment security staff must first adjudicate or investigate, Gates continued.
For example, if the former employee was not let go for lack of work, the state has to find out if the worker got fired or quit voluntarily. Another complex wrinkle for many displaced workers is to determine when severance pay or unused vacation pay would be exhausted as that would trigger the beginning of eligibility of someone for unemployment, Gates added.
"Some of the adjudication does require special skills but with this new computer system we are working on repetitive fact finding that can be done to shorten the amount of time it takes for us to process a claim," he said.
Last week, the head of the State Employees Association questioned whether employment security staff be exempt from mandatory furloughs in a tentative collective bargaining agreement because of the crunch of people who need help.
Under the proposed deal, all state workers would have to take 18 days off between now and July 1, 2011.
"It's clear this agency has been understaffed for some time. Now we've got to wonder whether there should be exemptions built into the furlough process to help agencies like this one get through a difficult time," said Jay Ward, political director for the State Employees Association.
Lynch has pressed for the furloughs to apply to all employees -- including himself -- regardless of rank or agency. Those who work in so-called essential care roles such as nurses at the state hospitals will continue working but give up getting paid overtime when they work on designated holidays, state officials confirmed this week.
