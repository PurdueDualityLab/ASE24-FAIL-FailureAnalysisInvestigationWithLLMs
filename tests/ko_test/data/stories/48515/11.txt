NEW YORK (AP) - About a thousand people rallied in Manhattan on Saturday in support of federal health care reform legislation.
The event near Times Square began shortly after the funeral for U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, and took on the feel of a tribute to the liberal leader.
One person carried a sign that said, 'TeddyCare for all.'
U.S. Rep. Carolyn Maloney told the crowd the bill will lower health care costs for almost everyone. The New York Democrat also invoked Kennedy, saying the senator understood the need for change.
Opponents say the legislation will cost too much and diminish the quality of care.
ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) - A Minnesota man is accused of ripping off his 4-year-old son's shirt and hitting him for wearing a rival gang's color.
Thirty-year-old Kenny T. Jackson of St. Paul is charged with malicious punishment of a child.
According to the criminal complaint, a man who said he was Jackson's stepfather called 911 on Tuesday to say Jackson was yelling and throwing things in the house. The caller said Jackson was angry because he is reportedly a member of the Bloods gang and the boy's blue shirt was the color of a rival gang.
Police say they found the boy shirtless, scratched and crying.
The complaint says Jackson denied the allegations.
It was not clear Saturday if Jackson had an attorney, and a number for him could not be found.
CONCORD, N.H. (AP) - New Hampshire is opening five unemployment offices around the state this weekend to ease the backlog of people filing claims.
Computer glitches and understaffing has led to long waits that Gov. John Lynch says are unacceptable.
Offices in Concord, Manchester, Nashua, Salem and Somersworth will be open Saturday and Sunday to deal with the backlog.
The state call center also will be staffed.
Last month, New Hampshire's unemployment rate was 6.8 percent, 3 points higher than July of 2008.
SUDBURY, Mass. (AP) - Police say a Sudbury man stole a skull, jaw and other bones after breaking into several 19th-century burial vaults at two Sudbury cemeteries.
Leonard Caira was arrested Friday after officers found human bones at his home. Authorities had not determined a possible motive.
Caira, who is 26, has been charged with wanton destruction of property, wanton or malicious defacement of a tomb and violating interment. Caira did not enter a plea at his arraignment Friday at Framingham District Court.
He was released without bail but ordered to stay away from human remains, burglar's tools and cemeteries. A pre-trial conference was scheduled for Oct. 7.
It was unclear whether he had hired an attorney.
