New Hampshire Gov. John Lynch is opening unemployment offices in Concord, Manchester, Nashua, Salem and Somersworth this weekend to ease a backlog in people filing claims.
Computer glitches and understaffing has led to long waits that Lynch says are unacceptable.
Last month New Hampshire's unemployment rate was 6.8 percent, 3 points higher than July of 2008.
The offices will be open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. The call center also will be staffed from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. That number is 1-800-266-2252.
The state is working to make the password system easier, open a second computer resource center in Manchester, place greeters in the front of offices and to separate people with simpler problems from those who need to speak to counselors.
