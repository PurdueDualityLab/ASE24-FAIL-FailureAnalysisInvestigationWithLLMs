Aug. 28--CONCORD -- The state unemployment offices in Nashua and four other cities will be open Saturday and Sunday to deal with a backlog of people seeking jobless benefits.
Gov. John Lynch and Employment Security Commissioner Tara Reardon made the announcement a day after Lynch said password ware and other computer problems "overwhelmed" the agency.
The Telegraph first reported Lynch said he would deploy personnel temporarily from other state agencies to assist.
"We hope these extra hours will help reduce the backlog and ensure citizens are served in a timely manner," Gov. Lynch said. "We are also continuing to work to identify and implement other improvements to the system."
Deputy Chief of Staff Pamela Walsh confirmed those working the weekend will be paid overtime in the midst of a tight state budget season while a statewide freeze on hiring, out-of-state travel, equipment and purchasing remains in place.
There's no estimate for the overtime cost, Walsh said. Veteran observers could not recall weekend hours at unemployment offices occurring over at least the past three decades.
The NHWorks Office at 6 Townsend West in Nashua will be open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. both days along with unemployment offices in Concord, Manchester, Salem, and Somersworth.
The agency's call center will be open to help benefit recipients from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. both days, Lynch said.
The Departments of Safety and Health and Human Services are sending temporary help. Safety Commissioner John Barthelmes dispatched Director of Policy Kevin O'Brien to the unemployment agency as O'Brien has helped alleviate customer services problems in the past at the Division of Motor Vehicles.
Lynch required that workers from other agencies must come with experience dealing with customer questions, Walsh added.
In addition to the weekend hours, Employment Security will be making a password system easier for claimants to use; open a second computer resource center in Manchester; put greeters in the front of offices; and triage clients so people with simpler problems won't have to wait to meet with counselors.
"I saw mothers with three kids standing waiting in line for three hours. That's not right," Lynch told reporters Wednesday.
Unemployment in New Hampshire stayed level at 6.8 percent, which was well below the national average but nearly double the jobless rate of a year ago.
The agency problems started last week when hundreds of people did not receive their regular unemployment checks due to a printing glitch, while many others got duplicate checks.
Many of those collecting jobless benefits have struggled with a new program that required online password changes, Lynch explained.
"They're trying to find a balance of ensuring security of individuals and simplifying the process so it's useable," Lynch said.
"My hope is technical changes can begin to be addressed by this weekend."
Last week as many as 2,700 of 20,000 who were using the Internet to log in and file their claims were shut out of the system due to difficulty entering their proposed passwords, DES Deputy Commissioner Darrell Gates said.
He estimated those with filing issues were at 1,500 to 2,000 this week.
The state's information technology agency has agreed to carve out a simple, five-character password alternative for those having trouble with the original version, Gates added.
