Monday, August 31MANCHESTER, N.H. - Hundreds of people took advantage of open unemployment offices over the weekend in New Hampshire.
Offices in Concord, Manchester, Nashua, Salem and Somersworth are staying open on weekends through September to ease a backlog in people filing claims.Computer glitches and understaffing have led to long waits that Gov. John Lynch says are unacceptable.
The Concord office was busiest on Saturday, with 143 people, most of them just laid off at Precision Technology in Pembroke, filing claims.
