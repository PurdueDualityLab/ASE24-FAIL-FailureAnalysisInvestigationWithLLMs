Cape Canaveral, Florida -- THE LAUNCH of a powerful new space telescope, a $1.2 billion (1.1 billion euros) mission that marries high technology, innovative design and sheer determination, was delayed for at least a week Thursday by a technical glitch. But for a project 20 years in the making, what's another few days?
Boosted into orbit around the sun and chilled to a few degrees above absolute zero, the Space Infrared Telescope Facility, or SIRTF (pronounced SIR-tiff), will focus on the faint heat emitted by stars and planets in the making, targets that until now have been shrouded in dusty mystery.
The compact 850-kilogram observatory, so sensitive it could detect the pulse from a TV remote control 16,000 kilometers away, will probe the chemical composition of enigmatic brown dwarfs, would-be suns that lack enough mass to trigger nuclear ignition, and peer through intervening clouds of dust to map the hidden heart of the Milky Way.
Cooled by liquid helium, the telescope also will peer into the depths of space and time, capturing the faint glow of the first ragged galaxies that coalesced in the aftermath of the big bang, as well as emissions from the cooler outer regions of quasars powered by black holes. Closer to home, the super-chilled 85-centimeter mirror and a trio of detectors promise to give astronomers an unprecedented view of the outer reaches of our own solar system, where comets and icy chunks of debris slowly swarm about the faint flicker of the distant sun. Starting about two months after launch, the new telescope will begin collecting its bounty of data, beaming back eight gigabytes of data per day -- a staggering 20,000 observations a year -- over its five-year life. If all goes well, it will deliver a scientific windfall to astronomers who have been waiting since the project got under way in 1983.
"I believe SIRTF will significantly increase our understanding of the universe and will probably rewrite astronomy textbooks, just like the Hubble Space Telescope did," said Lia LaPiana, program executive at the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration headquarters.
Michael Werner, project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said, "SIRTF will be a factor of a hundred to a million times more capable than any previous facility for infrared astronomy."
The instrument is the fourth and final of NASA's vaunted "Great Observatories," following the Hubble, launched in 1990, the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, launched in 1991 (it lasted until 2000) and the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, launched in 1999. The idea was to build a fleet of telescopes sensitive to different portions of the electromagnetic spectrum because "many cosmic objects produce radiation over a wide range of wavelengths," said NASA science chief Edward J. Weiler. "It's important to get the whole picture."
This telescope is designed to capture infrared emissions from objects and processes that generate temperatures of just a few hundred degrees or less, what Mr. Werner calls "the old, the cold and the dirty."
"We can look with SIRTF at things that are old because we're using the telescope as a time machine," he said, referring to faint emissions from galaxies that formed shortly after the big bang. The expansion of the universe over the past 12 billion years or so has stretched that light into the infrared, making such objects difficult to observe with ground-based telescopes because of Earth's obscuring atmosphere.
Garth Illingworth, an astronomer at the University of California at Santa Cruz, said galaxy formation is one of the hottest topics in modern astronomy, and one that SIRTF is uniquely suited to study. "Learning about how galaxies formed, when they formed, how they come together and assemble and grow with time is really and truly one of the great quests of the next decade," he said.
The telescope will also probe the cold regions between the stars "where new stars are forming, dust around stars, which may be giving birth to planetary systems, cold things at the outer fringes of our solar system," he added. "And finally, we can look with SIRTF at things that are dirty . . . because of the ubiquitous interstellar dust, which blocks our view of things at optical wavelengths but are transparent in infrared."
Mounted atop a Boeing Delta 2 rocket, the 4.3-meter-long instrument will be boosted into space from the Cape Canaveral air force station on Florida's east coast.
The victim of budget cuts and resulting redesigns, the project survived primarily because of the innovation and determination of the scientists and engineers involved.
"We used to count the time to SIRTF's launch in decades," joked George Rieke, an astronomy professor at the University of Arizona. "If we'd known how many decades, we probably would have quit." The key was figuring out how to reduce the weight of the telescope to permit launch on a low-cost Delta.
The solution was as elegant as it was simple. Instead of encapsulating the telescope in a massive liquid helium dewar, or thermos, like earlier, more modest infrared telescopes, engineers decided to launch SIRTF at room temperature. Once in space, 360 liters of liquid helium will begin cooling the optical system and instrument detectors.
But that alone isn't enough. To achieve the ultralow temperatures required to detect the faintest targets, the telescope was redesigned to operate in the shade of a fixed solar panel that will always face the sun. Finally, the designers decided to put it in an orbit around the sun instead of Earth, far enough away to eliminate infrared emissions from the planet or the moon, which otherwise could wash out the feeble radiation from deep space.
All of that, plus the addition of the largest, most sensitive digital detectors ever built for an infrared telescope, represents "a great advancement in the state of the art for infrared observatories," said project manager David Gallagher.
SIRTF is equipped with three science instruments: a powerful charge-couple device camera sensitive to the shorter wavelengths of infrared radiation; a light-splitting spectrograph to study the chemical composition of the telescope's targets; and a multiband photometer that will gather pictures and spectrographic data at longer wavelengths.
"The only real downside to this warm-launch architecture is it hasn't been done before," Mr. Gallagher said. "So this is a first of a kind of demonstration of that. I believe after it's successful, this will become the way you do infrared missions."
