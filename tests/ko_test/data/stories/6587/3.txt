Sema Takes Olympic Business Jump To Become Games Technology Sponsor

MONTROUGE, France - The Anglo-French computer services and defense technology company Sema Group PLC is best known by people like network technicians and nuclear submarine commanders.
That image will radically change today when Sema announces an eight-year agreement valued at roughly $220 million to replace International Business Machines Corp. as the new ranking global technology sponsor of the Olympic Games.
The victory over sexier U.S. information technology companies will transform the little-known European systems integration firm of 16,500 people into one of the world's most recognized brands, analysts say. Now Sema will join heavyweight Olympic sponsors such as Xerox Corp., Visa International and Eastman Kodak Inc. in the exclusive club of Olympic Corporate Partners.
"The (Olympic) association gives potential customers a warm feeling that you are up there with the leaders in technology and can also deliver," said Ross Jobber, a technology sector analyst at Deutsche Bank. But, warns Sema's chief executive Pierre Bonelli, "I don't intend to use the Olympics to market products like IBM does. All I care about is showing the world this company has the knowledge to get the Olympic job done on time and on budget."
Until today, Sema had been content to remain a reliable but virtually anonymous player in the IT industry. Although the company has served as an Olympic subcontractor since 1992, Sema's biggest noise in the marketing arena has been its sponsorship of the London Symphony Orchestra. "The principal oboist is a good friend," Mr. Bonelli said.
Known throughout the industry for his distaste of risking shareholder value on marketing programs, Mr. Bonelli said he jumped at the opportunity to join in the fanfare of the Olympic marketing fraternity. The sponsorship will develop the muscle required to penetrate the fiercely competitive and rapidly evolving U.S. technology arena, he said.
"This partnership will take Sema out of the shadow of the big U.S. IT companies," Mr. Bonelli said. "We've always maintained that Sema is a global player, but we're not until we are established in America."
Mr. Bonelli's Olympic deal comes in the wake of an acrimonious split between the IOC and IBM over cost overruns, Internet transmission rights, and technical glitches over the years that included the crash of the IBM system at the 1996 Centennial Games in Atlanta.
During negotiations with the IOC earlier this year to extend its 38-year association with the Games, IBM had said it was willing to contribute sponsorship fees of approximately $400 million and charge the IOC nearly $600 million over the same period for installation and maintenance, so long as the company retained Internet rights. The two sides parted ways in August, when the IOC refused to relinquish commercial control of its Web site to IBM.
Mr. Bonelli said control of the Olympic Web site is inconsequential to the success of Sema's sponsorship. "We will architect the site," Mr. Bonelli explains. "But we are a company of engineers, not a company of marketeers."
Adds nuclear physicist Tidu Maini, who worked on U.S. nuclear-weapon development programs and is now Sema's senior vice president for corporate development, "no one Olympic sponsor will control the Internet site just because it happens to be in the technology business."
Under International Olympic Committee rules, Sema can trumpet its Olympic sponsorship as soon as the current IBM contract runs out after the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney. Nonetheless, Mr. Bonelli last week dispatched a group of Sema engineers to the U.S. to begin working on a technical platform for the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City.
"We build complex combat technology that must work the first time, every time. There is zero tolerence for error." said Mr. Bonelli, outlining his three-year plan to rewire every facet of the Games, including the global interface of telecom systems, timing, event results, and broadcast feeds.
Sema is the foundation of the Games' so-called post-2000 technology troika, a consortium of high-tech companies welded together to replace IBM after Sydney. By the end of this year, the IOC will formally announce two more sponsorship deals, including one with the Swiss-based watchmaker Swatch Group AG to manage venue results beginning with the 2004 Summer Games in Athens. The group's third member, a hardware supplier, will be either Compaq Computer Corp. or Sun Microsystems Inc., IOC officials said. Like Sema and Swatch, the hardware sponsor will become a global Olympic Partner.
IOC marketing director Michael Payne said the trio will contribute approximately $500 million in cash and value-in-kind to wiring the Games as part of their partnership package between 2002 and 2008. The IOC and its local organizing committees will pony up around $200 million to pay for the installation and maintenance of the new system, Mr. Payne added.
For Sema, its entry into the Olympics comes when the company is shifting focus away from the energy and defense industries, where revenues were slowing, toward high-growth markets such as telecommunications. Though analysts have heaped praise on Mr. Bonelli's low-key style, Sema's share price this year has been under pressure following a disappointing first-half in which the company reported results below the industry average. Analysts were troubled especially by the low margins and the negative effect of high research and development costs. From its high of 825 pence ($13.73) a share, Sema's share have slipped 41% to close at 500 pence on Friday.
The largest gap in the Sema portfolio clearly remains the U.S., which generates over one-third of the world's software and services revenue, but only 4% of Sema's income in 1997. For many years the company was barred from making acquisitions in the U.S. as a result of restrictions on financial institutions selling non-financial products. Under U.S. law, Sema was considered a subsidiary of France's Banque Paribas, which controlled the voting rights of Financiere Sema, a holding company that in turn owned 41.2% of Sema. After reconfiguring shareholding structure in late 1997, the French bank now holds only 14% of the company, well below the required U.S. threshold.
Since then, Mr. Bonelli said Sema has been intent on spending at least $1 billion on either a general outsourcing or telecoms operation in the U.S. If the Sema can successfully complete its expansion, said a recent report by Deutsche Bank, the company "will emerge as one of only a few European-based global players" in the computer-services sector.
Sema is currently Europe's second largest computer-services company behind Cap Gemini SA, with 1997 revenues that were one-eleventh of those posted by IBM's mammoth Global Services division. "In the U.S. I doubt whether many people would even know the name (Sema)," said Richard Holway said, an independent technology analyst.
Mr. Bonelli said he isn't surprised the company remains uncelebrated, but he expects the Olympics will end the anonymity of his engineers. "Frankly, the Games are really a lot more consumer friendly than installing defense systems," he said.
