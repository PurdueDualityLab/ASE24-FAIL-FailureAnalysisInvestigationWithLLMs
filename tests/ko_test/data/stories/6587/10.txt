Olympics organizers yesterday described the eight-year deal with Sema, a French-English company, as the biggest sports-related information technology contract ever awarded. While figures were not disclosed, the deal was believed to be worth about $220 million in cash and services.
Sema will head a consortium of three companies in the IOC's new Olympic Information Technology Group. The companies will provide the computer technology and results systems for the summer games of 2004 and 2008 and winter games of 2002 and 2006.
The Salt Lake City Winter Olympics in 2002 will be the first games operating under the agreement.
Sema is a computer services and defense technology firm employing 16,500 people.
Sema provided information systems at the 1992 Barcelona Games and has been involved in other sports events such as the 1994 World Cup, the 1996 European Soccer Championship and the 1998 Commonwealth Games.
IBM was roundly criticized for glitches in its computer results system at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
The IOC said Sema will also help develop the IOC's Internet sites.
