A relatively obscure European computer company beat out several leading U.S. technology firms Monday to replace IBM as the Olympics' chief technology sponsor, starting in 2001.
Olympics organizers described the eight-year deal with Sema, a French-English company, as the biggest sports-related information technology contract ever awarded. While figures weren't disclosed, estimates on the deal's value range from $220 million to $300 million.
Sema takes over the high-profile sponsorship after International Business Machines Corp. and the International Olympic Committee ended their 38-year association in August in dispute over cost overruns, commercial control of the IOC's Web site and much-publicized technical glitches at the 1996 Centennial Games at Atlanta.
Sema will head a consortium of three companies in the IOC's new Olympic Information Technology Group. The companies will provide the computer technology and results systems at the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Games and the 2004 Athens Summer Games as well as the two subsequent Olympics.
Sema, which employs 16,500, is the No. 2 computer services company in Europe after Cap Gemini SA.
"It's not a very well-known brand name, but they come to the table with a tremendous amount of knowledge and understanding," IOC Marketing Director Michael Payne said. Payne said the partners for venue results management and for computer hardware will be announced in early 1999.
The Swiss watchmaker Swatch is favored to win the results contract, with Compaq and Sun Microsystems, two U.S. computer makers, in the running for the hardware deal.
Payne said the three companies will contribute about $500 million in cash and services to the Games as part of their partnership, with the IOC and organizing committees putting up around $200 million for the installation and maintenance of the new system. The contract with Sema will be signed Saturday in Lausanne by IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch.
Sema beat other Olympic bidders including IBM, the No. 1 computer company; IBM's biggest competitor, Electronic Data Systems Corp.; and Andersen Consulting to join the likes of Xerox Corp. and Eastman Kodak Inc. as an Olympic sponsor.
IBM suffered a blow to its image when its computer system was unable to transmit timely, accurate results from events to press centers in Atlanta in 1996.
