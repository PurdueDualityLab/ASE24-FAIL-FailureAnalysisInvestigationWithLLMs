Sema, a relatively obscure European computer company, beat out several leading technology companies Monday to replace IBM as the Olympics' chief technology sponsor, starting in 2001.
IBM Corp., the world's largest computer company, said in August that it would end its 38-year partnership with the International Olympic Committee at the 2000 Sydney Games.
Olympics organizers on Monday described the eight-year deal with Sema, a French-English company, as the biggest sports-related information technology contract ever awarded. While figures weren't disclosed, the deal was believed to be worth about $220 million.
Sema will head a consortium of three companies in the IOC's new Olympic Information Technology Group. The companies will provide the computer technology and results systems for the summer games of 2004 and 2008 and winter games of 2002 and 2006.
The Salt Lake City Winter Olympics in 2002 will be the first games operating under the new technology arrangement.
Sema is a computer services and defense technology company employing 16,500 people. The high-profile tie-in with the Olympics should put the company on the world map.
Sema provided information systems at the 1992 Barcelona Games and has been involved in other sports events, including the 1994 World Cup, the 1996 European Soccer Championship, and the 1998 Commonwealth Games.
"It's not a very well-known brand name, but they come to the table with a tremendous amount of knowledge and understanding," IOC marketing director Michael Payne said. "The IOC's primary decision was to ensure we had the best technology solution and to create as risk-free a scenario as possible."
IBM was roundly criticized for glitches in its computer results system at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
The IOC said Sema will provide the systems integration, operations management, and applications delivery for the Olympics. The company also will help develop the IOC's Internet sites.
Payne said the partners for venue results management and for computer hardware will be announced in early 1999. The Swiss watchmaker Swatch is favored to win the results contract, with U.S. computer makers Compaq and Sun Microsystems in the running for the hardware deal.
