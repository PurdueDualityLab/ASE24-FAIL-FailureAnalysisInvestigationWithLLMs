Sema Group P.L.C., Europe's second-largest computer services company, won a contract yesterday worth up to $300 million to run the computer systems for the four Winter and Summer Olympic Games from 2002 to 2008, replacing the International Business Machines Corporation.
Sema, a British-French company, will provide computer support for administration, accommodation, transport and communication, beginning with the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City. It will also be a top sponsor of the Games. Sema takes over the sponsorship after I.B.M. and the International Olympic Committee ended a 38-year association in August, because of disagreements about cost overruns, commercial control of the committee's Web site and technical glitches at the 1996 Summer Games at Atlanta.
