Coventry-based Keller Group yesterday announced pounds 20million worth of new orders.
The ground engineering services company said the transport infrastructure contracts had come in during the last two months.
In the US, Keller has been awarded a Kentucky contract valued at pounds 16.8million for ground improvement work on Route 9.
Through its Australian subsidiary Franki Pacific Holdings, it has secured an additional contract linked in with the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games for support in the expansion of Sydney airport.
And in Germany, Keller has been awarded a pounds 1million contract for ground investigation work on the MAGLEV rail project.
Chief executive Mr Tom Dobson said the company "continues to benefit from increased governmental spending on infrastructure projects in all core growth markets".
Meanwhile Anglo-French Sema Group said it had won a key Olympic Games IT contract, helping to fill a void left when IBM ends its 40- year association with the Games.
The fast-growing Sema, whose shares are included in the FTSE 100 index of top companies, said the multi-million pound agreement was the largest sports-related information technology contract ever awarded.
The contract covers the 2004 and 2008 Olympics and the Winter Games in 2002 and 2006.
The IT services company, looking to expand in the US, said it represented a unique opportunity to raise its brand image to a worldwide audience.
Sema has signed a partnership agreement with the International Olympic Committee, whereby it will join a group of leading Games sponsors.
The move follows a recent announcement by US giant IBM that it would end its long-standing Olympic sponsorship after the 2000 Games in Sydney.
IBM had fallen out with the IOC over projected IT costs for forthcoming Olympics and was unhappy at the IOC's refusal to hand over commercial control of its Internet site.
The company's image also took a battering after computer glitches marred the 1996 Games in Atlanta. Illustration
