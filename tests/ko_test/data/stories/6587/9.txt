SEMA WINS KEY CONTRACT FOR OLYMPICS

THE UK-French group Sema announced yesterday it had won a key Olympic Games information technology contract, helping to fill the void which will be left when International Business Machines ends its 40-year association with the Games.
The fast-growing Sema Group, whose shares are included in the FTSE 100 index, said the multi-million-pound agreement was the largest sports-related information technology contract ever awarded.
The contract covers the 2004 and 2008 Olympics, and the Winter Games in 2002 and 2006.
The IT services company, which is looking to expand in the United States, said the deal represented a unique opportunity to raise its brand image to a worldwide audience.
Sema has signed a partnership agreement with the International Olympic Committee whereby it will join a group of leading Games sponsors.
The move follows a recent announcement by the US giant IBM that it would end its long-standing Olympic sponsorship after the 2000 Games in Sydney.
IBM had fallen out with the IOC over projected IT costs for forthcoming Olympics and was unhappy at the IOC's refusal to hand over commercial control of its internet site.
The company's image also took a battering after computer glitches marred the 1996 Games in Atlanta.
As technology systems integrator, Sema will supervise IT suppliers and will also be responsible for diffusing data to world press agencies and the internet.
It will also oversee the running of information systems for matters such as accreditation, accommodation and transport.
The IOC marketing director Michael Payne said the deal with Sema was part of a move back to a consortium approach, which was employed until the Atlanta Games two years ago.
'We are on target to deliver a solution at less than half of what it would have cost us,' Mr Payne said.
Sema is expected to lead a three-pronged team meeting the complex IT needs of the Olympics, the greatest showpiece in world sport. The other parts of the team are a hardware supplier and a timing company.
'We expect the other two elements to fall into place in the next couple of months,' Mr Payne said.
He declined to comment on a newspaper report that Switzerland's Swatch Group would be one of the partners from the 2004 Games in Athens. The Japanese watchmaker Seiko is providing the timing expertise for the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City.
The hardware supplier, the third element in the consortium, is seen as an American battle between Compaq Computer and Sun Microsystems.
The awarding of the contract helped to push Sema shares up 3p to 507p.
