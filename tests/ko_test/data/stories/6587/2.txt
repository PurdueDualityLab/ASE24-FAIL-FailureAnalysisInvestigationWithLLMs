Sema Group to Enter $220 Million Pact To Be Technology Sponsor of Olympics

MONTROUGE, France -- The AngloFrench computer-services and defense-technology company Sema Group PLC is best known by people like network technicians and nuclear submarine commanders.
Tht image will radically change today when Sema announces an eight-year agreement valued at roughly $220 million to succeed International Business Machines Corp. as the new ranking global technology sponsor of the Olympic Games.
The victory over sexier U.S. information technology companies will transform the little-known European systems-integration firm of 16,500 people into one of the world's most recognized brands, analysts say. Now Sema will join heavyweight Olympic sponsors such as Xerox Corp., Visa International and Eastman Kodak Inc. in the exclusive club of Olympic Corporate Partners.
"The [Olympic] association gives potential customers a warm feeling that you are up there with the leaders in technology and can also deliver," said Ross Jobber, a technology sector analyst at Deutsche Bank.
Until today, Sema had been content to remain a reliable but virtually anonymous player in the information-technology industry. Although the company has served as an Olympic subcontractor since 1992, Sema's biggest noise in the marketing arena has been its sponsorship of the London Symphony Orchestra.
Known throughout the industry for his distaste of risking shareholder value on marketing programs, Sema's Chief Executive Officer Pierre Bonelli said he jumped at the opportunity to join in the fanfare of the Olympic marketing fraternity. The sponsorship will develop the muscle required to penetrate the fiercely competitive and rapidly evolving U.S. technology arena, he said.
"This partnership will take Sema out of the shadow of the big U.S. [information-technology] companies," Mr. Bonelli said. "We've always maintained that Sema is a global player, but we're not until we are established in America."
Mr. Bonelli's Olympic deal comes in the wake of an acrimonious split between the International Olympic Committee and IBM over cost overruns, Internet transmission rights and technical glitches over the years that included the crash of the IBM system at the 1996 Centennial Games in Atlanta.
During negotiations with the IOC earlier this year to extend its 38-year association with the Games, IBM had said it was willing to contribute sponsorship fees of approximately $400 million and charge the IOC nearly $600 million over the same period for installation and maintenance, so long as the company retained Internet rights. The two sides parted ways in August, when the IOC refused to relinquish commercial control of its Web site to IBM.
Mr. Bonelli said control of the Olympic Web site is inconsequential to the success of Sema's sponsorship. "We will architect the site," Mr. Bonelli explains. "But we are a company of engineers, not a company of marketeers."
Under IOC rules, Sema can trumpet its Olympic sponsorship as soon as the current IBM contract runs out after the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney. Nonetheless, Mr. Bonelli last week dispatched a group of Sema engineers to the U.S. to begin working on a technical platform for the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City.
Sema is the foundation of the Games' so-called post-2000 technology troika, a consortium of high-tech companies welded together to replace IBM after Sydney. By the end of this year, the IOC will formally announce two more sponsorship deals, in cluding one with Swiss watchmaker Swatch Group AG to manage venue results beginning with the 2004 Summer Games in Athens. The group's third member, a hardware supplier, will be either Compaq Computer Corp. or Sun Microsystems Inc., IOC officials said. Like Sema and Swatch, the hardware sponsor will become a global Olympic Partner.
