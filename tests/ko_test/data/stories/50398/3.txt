Aircraft movements in northern England and Scotland were getting back to normal tonight after a radar "glitch" led to temporary restrictions.
Air traffic control agency NATS said all aircraft were accounted for and in voice contact with control towers throughout the disruption.
A problem emerged with radar data processing systems at around 5.50pm and flights into airports within the Manchester Area Control - north of the Midlands and Scotland - were immediately restricted.
Nats said the matter was resolved within 15 minutes but full restrictions remained until 6.30pm as a precaution.
Normal service resumed shortly after 8pm, the organisation added.
A Nats spokeswoman said: "There was a temporary glitch in the radar data processing system.
"We knew where the aircraft were and we were in voice communication throughout.
"As a precaution we restricted the number of aircraft coming into the Manchester area."
