AIRCRAFT movements in northern England and Scotland were temporarily restricted last night after a 40-minute radar glitch, air traffic control agency NATS said. The organisation added all aircraft were accounted for and in voice contact with control towers. Flights into airports within the Manchester Area Control - north of the Midlands and Scotland - were restricted immediately after the problem emerged at 5.50pm.
