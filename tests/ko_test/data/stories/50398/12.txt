AIRCRAFT movements in Scotland were restricted last night after a 40-minute radar 'glitch' in the air traffic control system.
The problem left planes without computerised air traffic control instructions across the north of the UK. However, air traffic control agency NATS said all aircraft were in voice contact with control towers during the breakdown.
Flights into airports within the 'Manchester Area Control' - which covers the Midlands to Scotland - were restricted immediately after the problem emerged at 5:50pm. The restrictions were partially lifted at 6:30pm and a full service was resumed at 8:15pm.
Edinburgh Airport said the problem had resulted in delays, although 'there were no real problems for passengers'.
