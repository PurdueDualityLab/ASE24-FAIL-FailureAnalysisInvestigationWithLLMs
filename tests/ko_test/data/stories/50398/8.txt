AIRCRAFT movements in northern England and Scotland were temporarily restricted last night after a 40-minute radar 'glitch'.
Air traffic control agency NATS said all aircraft were accounted for and in voice contact with control towers.
Flights into airports within the Manchester Area Control - north of the Midlands and Scotland - were restricted immediately after the problem emerged at 5.50pm.
A spokeswoman said it was unclear how many flights would have been affected by the problem caused by a temporary glitch of the radar data processing system.
