FLIGHTS were restricted over Scotland and northern England for two hours last night after a radar glitch.
The number of aircraft coming into the area was cut between 5.50pm and 8pm while a problem with the radar data processing system was fixed.
Last night air traffic control agency NATS said: "We knew where the aircraft were and we were in voice communication. As a precaution we restricted the number of aircraft."
