AIRCRAFT movements in northern England and Scotland were getting back to normal late last night after a radar 'glitch' led to temporary restrictions.
Air traffic control agency NATS said all aircraft were accounted for and in voice contact with control towers throughout the disruption.
A problem emerged with radar data processing systems at around 5.50pm and flights into airports within the Manchester Area Control were immediately restricted.
Nats said the matter was resolved within 15 minutes but full restrictions remained until 6.30pm as a precaution.
