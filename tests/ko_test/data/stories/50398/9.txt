AIRCRAFT movements in Scotland were temporarily restricted last night after a 40-minute radar 'glitch' in the air traffic control system.
The problem left planes without computerised air traffic control instructions across the north of the UK. Air traffic control agency NATS said all aircraft were accounted for and in voice contact with control towers during the breakdown.
Flights into airports within the 'Manchester Area Control' - which covers the Midlands to Scotland - were restricted immediately after the problem emerged at 5:50pm. The restrictions were partially lifted at 6:30pm and a full service was resumed at 8:15pm. A spokeswoman said it was unclear how many flights were affected by the problem.
She said: 'There was a temporary glitch in the radar data processing system.
'We knew where the aircraft were and we were in voice communication throughout. As a precaution, we restricted the number of aircraft coming into the Manchester area.'
A spokesman for Edinburgh Airport said the problem had resulted in a 'small number' of delays. He added: 'There were no real problems for passengers.'
Aviation expert Jim Ferguson claimed such radar breakdowns were 'very rare'.
