Happy days are here again; ERP

ENTERPRISE Resource Planning (ERP) software companies are enjoying a revival on the stock markets because the sector is expected to pick up next year.
The sector was pummeled late last year when ERP software sales slowed down. But share price moves in the past couple of weeks suggest that investors believe the worst is over.
Analysts believe year-over-year comparisons should get easier starting in the fourth quarter, when the sector's slowdown surfaced last year.
'At this point, people are beginning to write off 1999 and look into 2000,' said Warburg Dillon Read analyst Andrew Roskill. 'Relative to historic valuation methods, the stocks are quite cheap.'
The ERP sales slowdown has been chalked up in part to customers' curtailing purchases in order to prepare their computer systems for the Y2K computer glitch.
Anticipation of the Y2K problem had for several years driven growth of ERP software, but as the deadline for fixing the problem approached, corporations began applying the brakes.
There was concern that there would not be enough time to install some of these programs in time for the 2000 deadline.
In addition, customers' expectations of ERP software, which automates back-office functions such as finance and human resources, have been changing.
Customers are looking beyond classic ERP programs, to software that could help them gain competitive advantages on the Internet and form stronger relationships with their customers as well.
In recent weeks, ERP companies have played up their long-term vision for e-business, customer-relationship management software, supply-chain management software, as well as how their products will be adapted to the Internet.
Oracle, SAP and J.D. Edwards, for example, recently hosted Wall Street analysts and customers at conferences in the US to tout their focus on the Internet, e-commerce and other strategies to boost growth.
Peoplesoft last week said it planned to roll out its software for electronic commerce, eMarketplace, next month. The company has been talking up its Internet strategy for the past several months.
Investors in the ERP software sector believe they've reached the nadir in terms of share prices and 'even if the second half will deliver more Y2K speedbumps, attentions are cast towards next year and beyond', said Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities analyst Robert Austrian.
But Oracle's upcoming fourth quarter results will be important in either sustaining investors' buoyant mood or turning it sour, he said.
Oracle, whose fourth quarter ends May 31, last week came under strong pressure over a pre-announcement that never materialised.
Most analysts, however, still trimmed their fourth-quarter earnings views.
Among the biggest movers in the ERP sector last week were Peoplesoft, Pegasystems, Manugistics Group, Baan, JDA Software Group, Aspen Technology, J.D. Edwards, Aspect Development and Oracle.
