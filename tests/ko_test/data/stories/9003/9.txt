Oracle's fourth-quarter results likely have "pockets of strength" in software sales in areas such as North America, major accounts and in customer relationship management software revenue, Banc Of America Securities analyst Bob Austrian said in a research note Thursday.
Still, the August and November quarters "look like wild cards," for the company, Austrian said.
The normal seasonal slowing during these quarters could be aggravated by the year 2000 computer glitch, negative currency impacts from the recent strong dollar and "a possibly drained pipeline given the significant push to close" the fourth quarter, he said in the note.
Oracle's stock has also recently been bolstered, according to Austrian, by the company's bullishness on its e-business products. Oracle hosted an e-business day Wednesday at its corporate headquarters in Redwood Shores, Calif.
E-business is regarded as one of the largest growth opportunities forbusiness software companies. Oracle also highlighted how its e-business products can help midsize businesses - another area of growth for the company. -Maria V. Georgianis; 201-938-5244; maria.georgianis@dowjones.com
