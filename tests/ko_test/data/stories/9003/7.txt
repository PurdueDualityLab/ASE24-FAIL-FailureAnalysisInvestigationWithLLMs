REDWOOD SHORES, Calif. (CBS.MW) -- Investors who've been buying into Oracle shares may not be clued in.
Shares in the database titan (orcl) have been cut nearly in half from theirhighs in the spring, prompting some investors to buy in ahead of a fiscal fourth-quarter earnings announcement due in two weeks.
Also boosting the interest in Oracle was a get-together on Wednesday to highlight its Internet operations at which Chief Executive Larry Ellison boasted that Oracle is 'entirely a Web-based company.'
Hot talk
Oracle, Ellison further claimed, is 'about to become the hottest company in town,' leading the 'Internet age' as IBM and Microsoft dominated previous eras of technological development.
A similar get-together held by IBM (ibm) added $18 billion to that company's marketcapitalization.
'It'll definitely having an impact, but it's sort of like it's their time to make their push,' U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray analyst Steven Kahl said of Oracle's planned e-business meeting. 'But it's one thing to market it and another thing to sell it.'
Banc of America Securities analyst Bob Austrian certainly isn't pushing the stock to clients. He rates Oracle a 'hold.'
'There are some encouraging signs about the May quarter -- that maybe it wasn't as bad as feared. But there's still ample worry about the rest of the calendar year,' said Austrian.
Diminished expectations
Following the semi-annual analysts' day in mid-May, a number of Wall Street banks trimmed their ratings and outlook for the company.
The concerns: The so-called year 2000 glitch or worries that companies will make sure their existing software programs are ready for the new millennium before buying new software, as well as turnover in its sales force and new competition from consulting companies.
Oracle shares rose 11/16 to 26 3/16 Wednesday. Austrian said he expected the stock to linger in the mid-20s through the rest of the year.
Profit outlook
Analysts expect Oracle to earn 32 cents per share, up from 27 cents per share in fourth-quarter last year, according to analysts surveyed by First Call. The company ( orcl) won't comment about analysts' projections.
Even if Oracle matches the profit expectation, there's no guarantee that the market will embrace the results. Oracle hit the consensus earnings estimate from analysts in the previous quarter, but the stock dropped.
The fourth quarter is a key period for Oracle as the company gets 40 percent of its sales in the final quarter of its fiscal year.
