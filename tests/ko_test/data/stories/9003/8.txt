NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Software supplier Oracle Corp.'s shares rose 5% Thursday on confidence that the company will meet fiscal fourth-quarter estimates, Gruntal & Co. analyst Vivek Rao said.
The database software giant closed its fourth quarter May 31 - its seasonally toughest period - without prereleasing results. Last month, Oracle's stock was pressured by concerns about a possible preannouncement.
At its Wall Street analyst meeting May 13, Oracle was cautious about near-term results. The next day, analysts reduced their fourth-quarter earnings estimate to 32 cents a share, down from 33 cents, according to First Call Corp.
In the year-ago period, Oracle reported earnings of 27 cents, adjusted for a 3-for-2 stock split in February.
The lack of a preannouncement improves the odds that Oracle "brought in a reasonable quarter, despite the very tough market environment," said Prudential Securities Inc. analyst Doug Crook in a research note Thursday.
Many business software companies have experienced slowing or declining year-over-year revenue growth as customers deferred buying new software until they prepare their computers for the year 2000.
Oracle (ORCL) advanced $1.313 to settle at $27.50.
Oracle's fourth-quarter results likely have "pockets of strength" in software sales in areas such as North America, major accounts and in customer relationship management software revenue, Banc Of America Securities analyst Bob Austrian said in a research note Thursday.
Still, the August and November quarters "look like wild cards," for the company, Austrian said.
The normal seasonal slowing during these quarters could be aggravated by the year 2000 computer glitch, negative currency impacts from the recent strong dollar and "a possibly drained pipeline given the significant push to close" the fourth quarter, he said in the note.
Oracle's stock has also recently been bolstered, according to Austrian, by the company's bullishness on its e-business products. Oracle hosted an e-business day Wednesday at its corporate headquarters in Redwood Shores, Calif.
E-business is regarded as one of the largest growth opportunities forbusiness software companies. Oracle also highlighted how its e-business products can help midsize businesses - another area of growth for the company. -Maria V. Georgianis; 201-938-5244; maria.georgianis@dowjones.com
