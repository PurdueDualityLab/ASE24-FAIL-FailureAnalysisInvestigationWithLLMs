NEW YORK -- Oracle Corp. fell on concerns that the database software giant might lower its earnings outlook for its fourth quarter.
Over the past two weeks, Oracle has been "more cautious in their comments" about its fourth fiscal quarter ending May 31, said Goldman Sachs & Co. Rick Sherlund.
Sherlund noted that Oracle missed analysts' revenue targets during its third fiscal quarter and that there has been "a fair amount of uncertainty" about how successful the company will be converting deals into actual revenue.
Several business software companies have faced prospects of slowing near-term revenue growth. In particular, the year 2000 computer glitch is leading customers to defer buying new software until they fix their existing systems.
Oracle is hosting a financial analyst meeting Thursday after the close. Sherlund said he is anticipating that the company will be "negative on the quarter" but positive in terms of its long-term strategic direction.
In recent trading, Oracle was down 1 13/16, or 7.2%, at 23 1/2.
