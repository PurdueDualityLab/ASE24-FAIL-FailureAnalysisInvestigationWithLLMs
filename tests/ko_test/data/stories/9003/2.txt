Enterprise-Resource-Planning Software Stocks Rise On Rebound Hopes

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enterprise-resource-planning software stocks continued their recent revival Thursday on expectations of improving fundamentals in 2000.
Much of the sector was pummeled last fall when a slowdown in sales of enterprise-resource-planning, or ERP software, emerged. But stock moves over the past couple of weeks suggest that investors believe the worst is over.
Analysts believe year-over-year comparisons should get easier in the fourth quarter, when the sector's slowdown surfaced last year, or by the first quarter of 2000.
"At this point, people are beginning to write off 1999 and look into 2000," said Warburg Dillon Read analyst Andrew Roskill. "Relative to historic valuation methods, the stocks are quite cheap," he said, adding that some short covering may also be driving up the stocks.
The ERP sales slowdown has been chalked up in part to customers' curtailing purchases in order to prepare their computer systems for the year 2000 computer glitch.
Anticipation of the year 2000 problem had for several years driven growth of ERP software, but as the deadline for fixing the problem approached, customers began applying the brakes. There was concern that there wouldn't be enough time to install some of these programs in time for the year 2000 deadline.
In addition, customers' expectations of ERP software, which automates back-office functions such as finance and human resources, have been changing. Customers are looking beyond classic ERP programs to software that could help them gain competitive advantages on the Internet and form stronger relationships with their customers.
In recent weeks, ERP companies have played up their long-term vision for e-business, customer-relationship management software, supply-chain management software as well as how their products will be adapted to the Internet.
Oracle Corp. (ORCL), SAP AG (SAP) and J.D. Edwards & Co. (JDEC), for example, recently hosted Wall Street analysts and customers at conferences to tout their focus on the Internet, e-commerce and other strategies to boost growth.
Peoplesoft Inc. (PSFT) earlier Thursday said it planned to roll out its eMarketplace e-commerce software in June. The company has been talking up its Internet strategy for the past several months.
Investors in the ERP software sector believe they've reached the nadir in terms of stock prices and "even if the second half will deliver more Y2K speedbumps, attentions are cast towards next year and beyond," said Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities analyst Robert Austrian.
But Oracle's upcoming fourth fiscal quarter results will be important in either sustaining investors' buoyant mood or turning it sour, Austrian said.
Oracle, whose fourth quarter ends May 31, last week came under pressure concerns of a preannouncement that never materialized. Most analysts, however, still trimmed their fourth-quarter earnings views.
Among the biggest movers in the ERP sector Thursday, Peoplesoft was up $1.063, or 7% at $16.188, Pegasystems Inc. (PEGA) was up 87.5 cents, or 10.4%, at $9.25 and Manugistics Group Inc. (MANU) was up $1.125, or 12.7%, at $10, and Baan Co. N.V. (BAANF) was up 56.3 cents, or 5.2% at $11.438.
These moves follow gains Wednesday by JDA Software Group Inc. (JDAS),Aspen Technology Inc. (AZPN), J.D. Edwards, Aspect Development Inc. (ASDV) and Oracle, among others. - Maria V. Georgianis, 201-938-5244; maria.georgianis@dowjones.com
