NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- J.D. Edwards & Co., which develops enterprise resource planning, or ERP, software, Wednesday reported a second-quarter loss, as expected, because of a slowdown in demand as companies focused resources on fixing the year 2000 computer problem.
The Denver, Co.-based company said its net loss came to $10.4 million, or 10 cents a share on a fully diluted basis, compared with net income of $12.3 million, or 11 cents a diluted share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue increased 11% to $231.6 million.
The mean estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by First Call was for a loss of 12 cents per share.
In an earnings' outlook earlier this month, the company also attributed the loss to investments in product development, acquisition costs and the impact of staff additions made in the first quarter.
The company (JDEC) said its license fee revenue fell 12% to $67.2 million, compared to license fee revenue of $76.4 million. Services revenue rose 24% to $164.4 million.
The slowdown in the ERP software market has put many firms on notice. Most ERP firms posted huge jumps in revenue between 1997 and 1998 as customers bought software to upgrade their systems and prepare for the year 2000 computer glitch all at once. But sales of such business-management software have weakened and customers are taking longer to close license agreements.
Most companies that have a use for ERP software have already bought the products, analysts say, with estimates for market penetration at 65% among the larger companies that rely on these products. Also, customers' priorities have shifted very dramatically to embrace the Internet, and none of the big ERP players really have the right products in place given that change, some analysts have said.
In a move to address the business-to-business Internet commerce market, J.D. Edwards on May 17 agreed to buy Numetrix Ltd., a developer of supply-chain software, for about $80 million. The company said it will integrate Numetrix's products with its existing applications to link customers, suppliers and trading partners in supply chain networks.
Numetrix's software is designed to permit users to plan and manage their supply chains over the Internet.
The company also announced in May a deal with software reseller Catalyst Solutions to implement and deliver software in Europe. Financial terms weren't disclosed.
AMR Research Inc., a research firm, predicts 20% to 25% growth for the ERP market this year, down from 40% to 45% in 1998. According to Forrester Research, another research firm, Internet-based, business-to-business commerce is expected to become a $1.3 trillion market by 2003.
