'Setuid' files accessible to users could enable them to obtain system manager privileges.
Security vulnerabilities that could allow users to upgrade their operating system privileges to that of systems manager have been uncovered in Oracle 8.
The problem occurs because some of the 'setuid' executable files in the database application are accessible.
Internet Security Systems (ISS) said this glitch is only open to local attack, but with a majority of hacking offences committed internally, it is not something that should be underestimated.
Kevin Black, UK sales director for ISS, said: 'Coupled with careless administration or poor configuration, the vulnerability poses a medium to high security risk.'
Gary Pugh, UK data server marketing manager for Oracle, responded: 'A user ID and password is required for such exploitation, such as a backdoor left by a disgruntled employee.' Oracle has protected itself against such attacks by introducing a secure internet directory service that enables it to delete all credentials of a single user from the one location.
There have been no reported occurrences of security breaches due to this issue. But Ronan Miles, deputy chairman of the Oracle User Group, said: 'Oracle users may not admit to falling foul of this security issue because no-one wants to admit to running a vulnerable system.'
Black added: 'Due to the nature of the problem, it may be impossible to detect intruders on affected systems, given the level of control they have access to.'
Oracle is attempting to notify users via the Oracle Support website and is offering a patch at www.oracle.com/support/elec_sup. Oracle is incorporating the patch into future releases.
