NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- J.D. Edwards & Co. late Monday said it has agreed to buy Numetrix Ltd., a developer of supply-chain software, for about $80 million.
Denver-based J.D. Edwards (JDEC) develops enterprise-resource-planning, or ERP, software for manufacturing, finance, distribution and personnel operations for large companies.
The company expects the Numetrix deal to close next month and "slightly" boost earnings by late fiscal 2000. J.D. Edwards said it will integrate Numetrix's products with its existing applications to link customers, suppliers and trading partners in supply chain networks, a move the company said "strongly positions" it to address the business-to-business Internet commerce market.
Supply-chain software is being adopted by all types of companies to take the kinks out of their manufacturing processes. The software helps manufacturers and retailers manage their production and distribution, automating efforts as varied as ordering raw materials and generating forecasts for demand.
The deal comes amid a sense of gloom in the market for ERP software. ERP developers PeopleSoft Inc., Dutch firm Baan Co. NV, German giant SAP AG and other have seen slowed groth. Most ERP firms posted huge jumps in revenue between 1997 and 1998 as customers bought software to upgrade their systems and prepare for the year 2000 computer glitch all at once. But sales have weakened and customers are taking longer to close license agreements.
SAP (SAP) is the market leader. PeopleSoft (PSFT), Baan (BAANF) and database giant Oracle (ORCL) are the other big players. Cracks in the once-burgeoning market appeared last fall when Baan issued a third-quarter warning. Later, SAP and PeopleSoft posted disappointing fourth-quarter profits and said 1999 revenue growth would be slower than 1998.
J.D. Edwards in March warned of weaker-than-expected earnings. Shares of J.D. Edwards are off about 35% for the year. The stock settled at $17.9375 Monday.
Most companies that have a use for ERP software have already bought the products, analysts say, with estimates for market penetration at 65% among the larger companies that rely on these products. Also, customers' priorities have shifted very dramatically to embrace the Internet, and none of the big ERP players really have the right products in place given that change, some analysts have said.
Numetrix's software is designed to permit users to plan and manage their supply chains over the Internet. J.D. Edwards plans to announce a online-commerce strategy later this week.
AMR Research Inc., a research firm, predicts 20% to 25% growth for the ERP market this year, down from 40% to 45% in 1998. According to Forrester Research, another research firm, Internet-based, business-to-business commerce is expected to become a $1.3 trillion market by 2003.
