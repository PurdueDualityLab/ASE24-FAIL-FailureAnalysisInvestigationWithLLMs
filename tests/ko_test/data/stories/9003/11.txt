Several analysts have recently put out research notes alerting investors to Oracle's potential fourth-quarter shortfall. In a research note Tuesday, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. analyst William Epifanio said that recent checks "indicate a weak sales quarter for Oracle."
Dain Rauscher Wessels analyst Marshall Leisten said he believes that the company had a "pretty good" March, but a "soft" April, and could be looking to close up to 70% of their revenue in May, the last month of the quarter.
"It's going to be challenge to bring that amount of revenue in," Leisten said, citing the difficult purchasing environment because of the year 2000 computer glitch.
Oracle's competitors in the enterprise resource planning, or ERP, software market, such as SAP AG (SAP), Baan Co. (BAANF), PeopleSoft Inc. (PSFT), have reported declines in year-over-year license revenue growth in their first quarters. J.D. Edwards & Co. (JDEC), whose quarter ended April 30, preannounced a shortfall earlier in May.
Goldman's Sherlund said it would not be surprising if Oracle showed a year-over-year decline in its fourth-quarter application revenue, which represent its sales of ERP software.
Oracle's database sales are also "pretty tightly correlated with the ERP business as well," he noted. Oracle, which has pitching its database as a platform for e-commerce, also sells databases as part of an ERP system sale.
A consensus of analysts expect Oracle to report fourth-quarterearnings of 33 cents a share, according to First Call Corp. - Maria V. Georgianis; 201-938-5244
