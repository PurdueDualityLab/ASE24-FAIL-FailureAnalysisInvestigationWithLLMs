DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - A Wisconsin lottery official reported early Thursday that a winning ticket was sold there for the $194.4 million Powerball jackpot.
The director of the Multi-State Lottery Association in Des Moines confirmed that a winning ticket was sold in Wisconsin, but Charles Strutt said that is unofficial until results are certified by an auditor in Wisconsin.
He said no official results will be reported until the participating 20 state and the District of Columbia lotteries reported their audited results.
Wisconsin lottery spokesman Andrew Bohage said the ticket matching all five numbers plus the Powerball was sold at the Lakeside County Store in Pell Lake, Wis.
People across the nation crossed state borders and waited in long lines Wednesday with cash in hand and a dream of winning all or part of the record jackpot.
"I came up for the blinding chance of never having to work again in my life," said Mike Evans of Roy, Utah, who drove to an Idaho border town to buy tickets. "Somebody has to win this. It is an astronomical chance that nobody has won yet."
The jackpot, estimated earlier at $175 million, was raised to $194.4 million just before the drawing. Lottery officials said sales totaled $138.5 million for Wednesday's drawing, a new record.
Numbers drawn were 4, 9, 30, 34, 48 and Powerball 8.
Officials with the West Des Moines-based Multi-State Lottery Association said 83.3 percent of all possible winning combinations were sold in the District of Columbia and the 20 states that play Powerball.
People reportedly waited in line in some places for nearly an hour as they rushed to buy tickets for Wednesday night's 9:59 p.m. CDT drawing.
New Yorkers and people from East Coast states that don't participate in the multistate game poured into Greenwich, Conn., to buy tickets, police said.
"They're coming in hordes and congesting the roadways. We have lines two blocks long," said Sgt. John Brown, who bought one ticket for each member of his family. "People are just waiting, hoping for a dollar and a dream."
The Travel Emporium, a convenience store along the Indiana Toll Road just a few miles west of the Ohio border, sold more than $17,000 worth of tickets Tuesday, or about 25 times the normal daily volume of about $700.
"We've been seeing constant lines at the cash register, trailing out past our gate ... 150 at a time, and sometimes on past. It's absolutely just nuts here," Mindy Van Regenmorter, the store's manager, said Wednesday.
Players select five numbers from a pool of 49 and one other from a pool of 42. The odds of correctly picking all six numbers are 80.1 million-to-1.
There is an 80 percent chance that at least one ticket will match Wednesday night's numbers and a 60 percent to 70 percent chance of two or more winners, said Charles Strutt, executive director of the Multi-State Lottery Association.
A winner who chooses to receive the payout in cash would get about $104.3 million before taxes. The annuity option would give the winner $7.776 million before taxes once a year over 25 years, Strutt said.
With either option, about half of the prize is withheld in federal and state taxes, he said.
An increase in the jackpot's estimate is possible, but would likely not change until drawing time, said Iowa Lottery Commissioner Ed Stanek.
"In all 21 jurisdictions we're doing everything we can to make sure our computers are working properly; our security forces are in place to take care of any contingencies that might occur tonight," said Stanek, the game's creator.
One glitch was affecting how the game is broadcast.
Powerball drawings are sent live to 88 stations using the Galaxy IV satellite, which lost track of Earth on Tuesday night. The association planned to use another satellite, Strutt said.
The most tickets for Wednesday's drawing were sold in Delaware, Indiana, Connecticut and Kentucky.
In Iowa, tickets were selling at about 2,900 per minute Wednesday, and the state had sold 1 million tickets by mid-afternoon, said Iowa Lottery spokesman Joe Hrdlicka. To meet the demand, the state planned to cut off sales at 8:30 p.m. rather than 8 p.m.
West Virginia Lottery spokeswoman Nancy Bulla said the state was selling $6,000 worth of Powerball tickets per minute Wednesday afternoon, with the peak still to come. The average sale was $5 per person.
In Greenwich, Conn., Chris Canavan said a Bronx, N.Y., man bought 4,000 tickets Wednesday morning from his downtown service station. Overall, he said the four stations he owns in the Greenwich area have sold 106,000 tickets for Wednesday's drawing.
"We've had people here today from Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Maine. We even had someone from Texas call and try to buy them from a credit card, but of course, we couldn't do it," Canavan said.
While lottery officials have emphasized that Powerball is meant to be fun, not everybody was taking the size of the jackpot lightly.
"We're getting relapses from people who were compulsive gamblers," said Arnie Wexler, who runs a national 24-hour hot line out of Bradley Beach, N.J., for people concerned about their gambling.
The frenzy also brought out entrepreneurs.
A young man, who would identify himself only as "Bob," said he bought 2,000 tickets Tuesday and was selling the $1 ticket for $2 apiece Wednesday afternoon in Greenwich.
"They're $2 apiece right now, but they'll be $5 apiece before the day's over," he said.
