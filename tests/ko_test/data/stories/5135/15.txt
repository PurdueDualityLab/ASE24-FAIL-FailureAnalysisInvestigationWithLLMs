DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - One gambler on a ticket sold in Wisconsin beat Powerball's 80.1 million-to-1 odds. Three West Virginia tickets sold were worth $100,000 apiece.
A ticket sold in southern Wisconsin for Wednesday night's Powerball jackpot drawing, worth a world-record $195 million, was the only winner, lottery officials announced this morning.
The winning numbers were 4, 9, 30, 34, 48 and Powerball 8.
The winner's identity was not known. The big ticket was sold in Walworth County, Wis., at a store just across the state line from Illinois, a non-Powerball state.
The winning player in Wednesday's drawing chose to receive an immediate payout, which means the ticket is worth $104.3 million. The full jackpot would have been paid out over 25 years - at roughly $7.7 million a year.
In West Virginia, three secondary prize tickets worth $100,000 each were sold at Phillie's Quick Stop in Newell and 7-Eleven Food Stores in Wheeling, both in the Northern Panhandle, and a Sheetz store at Bridgeport, Harrison County, Lottery spokeswoman Nancy Bulla said today.
Powerball sales totaled $6.9 million in West Virginia for Wednesday's drawing, compared to $2.5 million for last Saturday's drawing for $118 million, Bulla said.
People crossed state borders and waited in long lines with cash in hand to buy tickets for the drawing.
"I came up for the blinding chance of never having to work again in my life," said Mike Evans of Roy, Utah, who drove to an Idaho border town to buy tickets. "Somebody has to win this. It is an astronomical chance that nobody has won yet."
People reportedly waited in line in some places for nearly an hour as they rushed to buy tickets for Wednesday night's 10:59 p.m. EDT drawing.
New Yorkers and people from East Coast states that don't participate in the multistate game poured into Greenwich, Conn., to buy tickets, police said.
Steve Crum of the southeastern Ohio village of Caldwell drove 50 miles to Williamstown, W. Va., to buy $20 worth of tickets.
"We're just buying a ton. It's so high now, and this is the only chance I'll ever have to make $175 million," Crum said.
Dennis Marr of the southeastern Ohio city of Marietta travels to West Virginia twice a year to play Powerball.
"It's a waste of money and I know that. But with the size of this, I had to do it," Marr said.
"They're coming in hordes and congesting the roadways. We have lines two blocks long," said Sgt. John Brown, who bought one ticket for each member of his family. "People are just waiting, hoping for a dollar and a dream."
Officials with the West Des Moines-based Multi-State Lottery Association said they expected $120 million in sales for the drawing in the District of Columbia and the 20 states that play Powerball, which would be a record.
Players select five numbers from a pool of 49 and one other from a pool of 42. The odds of correctly picking all six numbers are 80.1 million-to-1.
A winner who chooses to receive the payout in cash would get about $104.3 million before taxes. The annuity option would give the winner $7.776 million before taxes once a year over 25 years, said Charles Strutt, executive director of the Multi-State Lottery Association.
An increase in the jackpot's estimate is possible, but would likely not change until drawing time, said Iowa Lottery Commissioner Ed Stanek.
"In all 21 jurisdictions we're doing everything we can to make sure our computers are working properly; our security forces are in place to take care of any contingencies that might occur tonight," said Stanek, the game's creator.
One glitch was affecting how the game is broadcast.
Powerball drawings are sent live to 88 stations using the Galaxy IV satellite, which lost track of Earth on Tuesday night. The association planned to use another satellite, said Strutt.
The most tickets for Wednesday's drawing were sold in Delaware, Indiana, Connecticut and Kentucky.
In Greenwich, Conn., Chris Canavan, said a Bronx, N.Y., man bought 4,000 tickets Wednesday morning from his downtown service station. Overall, he said the four stations he owns in the Greenwich area have sold 106,000 tickets for Wednesday's drawing.
"We've had people here today from Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Maine. We even had someone from Texas call and try to buy them from a credit card, but of course, we couldn't do it," Canavan said.
While lottery officials have emphasized that Powerball is meant to be fun, not everybody was taking the size of the jackpot lightly.
"We're getting relapses from people who were compulsive gamblers," said Arnie Wexler, who runs a national 24-hour hot line out of Bradley Beach, N.J., for people concerned about their gambling.
The frenzy also brought out entrepreneurs.
A young man, who would identify himself only as "Bob," said he bought 2,000 tickets Tuesday and was selling the $1 ticket for $2 apiece Wednesday afternoon in Greenwich.
"They're $2 apiece right now, but they'll be $5 apiece before the day's over," he said.
