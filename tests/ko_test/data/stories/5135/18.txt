People around the nationdrove across state lines, waited an hour or more in crowded stores and put down their money yesterday in hopes of winning an estimated $195 million Powerball jackpot, the richest lottery prize in world history.
The winning numbers drawn last night were: Powerball 8; Regular numbers: 4 - 9 - 30 - 34 - 48.
"I came up for theblinding chance of never having to work again in my life," said Mike Evans of Roy, Utah, who drove to Idaho to buy tickets for the multistate lottery. "Somebody has to win this."
The longest lines were intowns near states that don't participate in the game. New Yorkers poured into Greenwich, Conn., with one man buying 4,000 tickets yesterday morning.
"They're coming in hordesand congesting the roadways. We have lines two blocks long," said police Sgt. John Brown, who bought one ticket for each member of his family.
The Travel Emporium, aconvenience store along the Indiana Toll Road a few miles west of the Ohio line, had lines of up to 150 people all morning. Powerball tickets are sold in Washington, D.C., and 20 states.
Many ticket buyers spenttheir time in line chatting about how they would spend the winnings. Among the usual answers - houses, cars and expensive vacations - were some more charitable causes.
"I would probably buildanother domestic violence shelter in the state and come up with schooling for unwanted kinds," said Reinna Fraaken of Des Moines.
The odds of correctly picking all six numbers were 80.1 million-to-1.
Charles Strutt, executivedirector of the Multi-State Lottery Association, which operates Powerball, said there was an 80 percent chance that at least one ticket would have all the right numbers and a 60 percent to 70 percent chance of two or more winners.
The winner can choose a lump-sum payment of about $94 million before taxes, or $7 million per year, before taxes, for 25 years.
Last year's Christmaslottery drawing in Spain - named "El Gordo," or "the Fat One" - had a $270 million purse, but it was not a winner-take-all lottery; the drawing offered 130 grand prizes of about $2 million each. Wednesday's Powerball drawing represents the world's biggest jackpot that could be won by one person.
A glitch wasaffecting how the drawing would be broadcast. The satellite that is used to send Powerball drawings live to 88 stations rolled out of position Tuesday night. The association planned to use another satellite.
Stanley Thomas, abuilding restorer, took a break from his work at a Kansas City, Mo., hotel to plunk down $5 for five chances to win.
"They say you have abetter chance of dying falling out of bed than winning the lottery," Thomas said. "But we're talking about $195 million. You've got to try. After all, it's only money."
Tickets for the game aresold in Washington, D.C., Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
