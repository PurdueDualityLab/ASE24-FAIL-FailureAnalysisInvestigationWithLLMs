New Mexicans bought nearly 1,000 lottery tickets per minute to boost their chances of winning the $85 million Powerball jackpot, officials said.
The jackpot was at it's highest since New Mexico began playing the multi-state game in October 1996.
Statewide, 969,183 tickets were sold for Wednesday's 9 p.m. drawing. More than 600,000 tickets were sold on Wednesday.
The winning numbers were 2-13-18-30-36. The Powerball number was 26.
New Mexico lottery officials got a scare Wednesday afternoon when machines went down between 1 and 3:30 p.m. throughout the state.
"Our glitch was a phone line disruption to our online vendor," said Nadine Guillen, a spokeswoman for the New Mexico Lottery.
"The phone line goes to our hub in Rhode Island. The line was disrupted, and that caused the machines to operate sluggishly," she said.
None of the tickets sold for the Powerball game Wednesday night matched all six numbers drawn.
The prize goes to an estimated $110 million for Saturday.
Tickets that match the first five numbers, but miss the Powerball, win $100,000 each, and there were 17 of those. They were sold in: Arizona, Connecticut, Indiana (3), Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, New Mexico (2), Rhode Island (3), Wisconsin (2) and West Virginia.
All the net proceeds of the New Mexico Lottery are invested in education in New Mexico. Since it started, $40 million has been sent to the state of New Mexico to benefit public education, according to the Lottery.
