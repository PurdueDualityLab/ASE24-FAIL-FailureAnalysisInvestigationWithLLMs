CHICAGO, May 20 (Reuters) - Hopeful lottery players lined up to buy chances at a U.S.-record $175 million jackpot at the rate of millions of dollars a minute on Wednesday, while critics warned compulsive gamblers to skip the enticement of supposedly easy money.
Long-shot odds of 80 million-to-one for a single winner did not deter sales of Powerball lottery tickets in the 20 states and the District of Columbia where they are offered, and long lines snaked around many grocery stores and gas stations.
"Sales are extremely large, even overwhelming," lottery spokeswoman Pam Hanshaw in West Des Moines, Iowa said. She said the pace at which the $1 tickets were being sold amounted to "millions a minute."
The lottery even suspended advertising because of the televised and published hype over the record prize.
The winning number was scheduled to be drawn on Wednesday at 10:59 p.m. EDT (0259 GMT) in West Des Moines when five white numbered balls and one red Powerball were to be selected.
Ticket sellers reported that many people traveled across state lines or called friends or relatives to secure tickets. Though Illinois was not among the Powerball states, residents clogged sales offices in all five surrounding states to purchase tickets.
In Washington, a long line of would-be millionaires in pinstripes and power suits sweltered in 90-degree (32 C) heat outside Woodword Liquors.
Inside the doors, Ruth Jackson perched on a stool waving her arms like a traffic cop to direct people to the Powerball queue or the liquor line.
"I'm the bouncer," she said. "The last two days have been crazy."
Asked what she would do with the $175 million if she won, Jackson cracked, "As soon as I come to, I'll tell you."
Some Philadelphia office workers formed pools to buy tickets in neighboring Delaware abandoned their plans after realizing they faced a daunting four-hour wait in line.
"It's been crazy. It's been very crazy. We've had to turn people away," said John Adams, store manager of the Shop 'N Bag convenience store in Claymont, Delaware, where the line to buy tickets has reached several hundred people long this week.
"Whether you win or lose isn't as important as the ability to dream about what you would do with all that money," said Boston native Chuck Kelcourse, a technical consultant who drove to New Hampshire to buy 11 tickets. Kelcourse said he had a laundry list of things to spend his winnings on and then planned to take an extended vacation.
Airwaves buzzed with interviews with ticket buyers willing to plunk down hundreds of dollars for a chance at winning the lottery prize, a result that oddsmakers said was considerably less likely than being struck by lightning or dying in a plane crash.
The $175 million prize would be paid over 25 years, outdistancing the previous U.S. record payout of $118.8 million split among 10 winning ticket-holders in California in 1991.
But it paled by comparison to the $270 million awarded in Spain's lottery last Christmas. Buyers of Powerball tickets could decide in advance whether they wanted a lump-sum payment of $94 million instead of the full amount over 25 years.
The size of the potential windfall sent optimists into a reverie, while causing consternation among those who treat compulsive gamblers.
"The compulsive gambler works on the pretense that their next bet is going to solve all their problems. He operates in a fantasy world," Chris Anderson, a therapist who is on the board of directors of the National Council of Gambling.
Anderson was in Chicago to testify at a two-day hearing of the National Gambling Impact Study Commission, which is due to present a report to Congress next year on the issue.
State-run lotteries have desensitized the public to the dangers of compulsive gambling, Anderson said. Some recent studies have shown up to 5 percent of the population are affected at some time in their lives.
Half of compulsive gamblers steal money to support their habit, ruining lives and creating an additional cost to society, Anderson said. He said that even buying a single lottery ticket can cause a recovering addict to relapse.
State governments sponsoring what was once the illegal "numbers racket" show all the signs of suffering from a collective gambling addiction as the prizes get larger, he said.
The state where the winning ticket was sold was expected to be known within a few hours of the drawing. A small glitch was resolved when lottery officials were forced to find another satellite to beam out the televised drawing to member states when its rented satellite time was lost.
