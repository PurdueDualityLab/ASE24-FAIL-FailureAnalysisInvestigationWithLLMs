Convenience store clerkswho usually yawn and sell an occasional cup of coffee or pack of cigarettes on a Wednesday night were besieged by long lines of customers with dreams of winning the $175 million Powerball jackpot.
As the clock ticked awaybefore the 9 p.m. cutoff for ticket sales, people bought by the dozens, while clerks patiently and not so patiently explained the lottery process to many first-timers.
At the Shell station onEarhart Boulevard and Carrollton Avenue in New Orleans, clerk Michelle Keller rolled her eyes at the first-timers. "They're marking everything wrong," she said, after selling at least 120 tickets in the past hour. "On a hot night like this, we'd be slow without the lotto."
When the machine shut down at the E-Z Serve on Claiborne and Carrollton avenues at 9 p.m., China Stewarts stomped her foot.
"I'm a regular," she said. "I'm always playing. I can't believe they shut the machine down now."
She waited 15 minutesimpatiently between aisles of potato chips and cookies, watching lottery newcomers figure out how to play $5. "I waited this long and now I missed it," she sighed.
The clerks breathed asigh of relief when a half-dozen people left the store after the machines shut down. The lone man left in line wanted two cans of beer but no lottery ticket.
"We sold about 3,000tonight and I can't tell you how glad I am it's over," a clerk said, adding the drawing usually generates about $300 in business.
The fervor may have begunearly for some thieves. The E-Z Serve in the 1900 block of Ormond Boulevard in Destrehan reported an undetermined number of lottery tickets were stolen Monday, according to reports from the St. Charles Parish Sheriff's Office.
Powerball players selectfive numbers from a pool of 49 and one other, the Powerball number, from a pool of 42. The odds of correctly picking all six numbers are 80 million to 1.
There is an 80 percentchance that at least one ticket will match Wednesday night's Powerball numbers and a 60 percent to 70 percent chance of two or more winners, said Charles Strutt, executive director of the Multi-State Lottery Association.
A winner who chooses toreceive a lump-sum payout would get about $84 million after taxes. The annuity option would give the winner $7 million before taxes once a year over 25 years, Strutt said.
With either option, about half the prize is withheld in federal and state taxes, he said.
One glitch was affecting how the game is broadcast.
Powerball drawings aresent live to 88 stations using the Galaxy IV satellite, which lost track of Earth on Tuesday night. The association planned to use another satellite, Strutt said.
