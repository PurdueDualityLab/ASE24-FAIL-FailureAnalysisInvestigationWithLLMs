The biggest lottery jackpot in history grew by an extra $25 million Tuesday when officials announced that unprecedented ticket sales for Powerball have pushed the top prize in tonight's drawing from $150 million to $175 million.
Minnesota State Lottery officials predict that 7.5 million tickets will be sold in Minnesota by the 9 p.m. sales cutoff tonight - up from 4 million that were sold for Saturday's drawing, when the official jackpot was $118 million. The drawing takes place shortly before 10 p.m.
In Wisconsin, officials expect ticket sales to break the state's record of 7.7 million that was set in 1993 when Leslie Robbins, a teacher from Fond du Lac, won $111.2 million.
That prize was the largest won since the creation of Powerball. The largest lottery jackpot ever won was $118.8 million, which was split among 10 California winners in 1991.
Minnesota State Lottery Director George Andersen urged players to exercise caution. 'It's an amazing amount of money, but players should keep the game in perspective,' he said, adding that consumers should 'have fun with it' while playing 'responsibly and within your means.'
The jackpot, which is based on ticket sales in 20 states and the District of Columbia, was set at $150 million after Saturday's drawing failed to produce a winner. But the jackpot estimate took a $25 million bump upward Tuesday afternoon when lottery officials noted a dramatic surge in ticket sales.
The $175 million jackpot reflects payments spread over 25 years. After taxes, the winner would receive about $4.4 million per year.
A cash option, which must be selected at the time the lottery ticket is purchased, would yield $94 million - or about $60.1 million after taxes, lottery officials said.
Andrew Bohage, a spokesman for the Wisconsin State Lottery, said officials think the jackpot could grow to $250 million if tonight's drawing fails to produce a winner.
'There have been no glitches so far, but we're mighty busy,' Bohage said. 'Lord help us all if it rolls over without a winner. It's getting goofy trying to contemplate that amount of money.'
