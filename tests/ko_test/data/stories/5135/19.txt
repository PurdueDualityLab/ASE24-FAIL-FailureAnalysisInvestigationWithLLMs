POWERBALL SALES ON RECORD ROLL

People waited in long lines Wednesday with cash in hand and a dream of winning all or part of a record estimated $175 million Powerball jackpot.
People reportedly waited in line in some places for nearly an hour as they rushed to buy tickets for Wednesday night's 9:59 drawing (Lottery results are listed on Page 2B).
Officials with the Multi-State Lottery Association in West Des Moines, Iowa, said they expected $120 million dollars in sales for the drawing in the District of Columbia and the 20 states that play Powerball, which would be a record.
Players select five numbers from a pool of 49 and one other from a pool of 42. The odds of correctly picking all six numbers are 80.1 million-to-1.
There is an 80 percent chance that at least one ticket will match Wednesday night's numbers and a 60 percent to 70 percent chance of two or more winners, said Charles Strutt, executive director of the Multi-State Lottery Association.
A winner who chooses to receive the payout in cash would get about $94 million before taxes. The annuity option would give the winner $7 million before taxes once a year over 25 years, Strutt said.
With either option, about half of the prize is withheld in federal and state taxes, he said.
An increase in the jackpot estimate is possible, but would likely not change until drawing time, said Iowa Lottery Commissioner Ed Stanek.
"In all 21 jurisdictions we're doing everything we can to make sure our computers are working properly. Our security forces are in place to take care of any contingencies that might occur tonight," said Stanek, the game's creator.
One glitch was affecting how the game is broadcast.
Powerball drawings are sent live to 88 stations using the Galaxy IV satellite, which lost track of Earth on Tuesday night. The association planned to use another satellite, Strutt said.
