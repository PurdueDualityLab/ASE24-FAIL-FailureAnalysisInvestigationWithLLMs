A computer overload prevented Wisconsin residents from buying Powerball lottery tickets for almost an hour Wednesday evening -- only hours before the drawing for an $85 million jackpot.
State lottery officials said heavy demand for the tickets overloaded a computer file and suspended the electronic sales.
Beginning about 7:30 p.m., customers and counter clerks waited at convenience stores and other outlets for sales equipment to resume operations.
Lottery employees responded to the overload by expanding the Powerball file, allowing transactions to resume.
Sales typically run $11,000 an hour. Because of interest in the unusually large payoff, sales averaged $65,000 an hour Wednesday, officials said.
