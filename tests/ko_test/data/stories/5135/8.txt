DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - People around the nation drove across state lines, waited an hour or more in crowded stores and put down their money Wednesday in hopes of winning a $194.4 million Powerball jackpot, the richest lottery prize in world history.
The winning numbers were: 4, 9, 30, 34, 48 and Powerball 8.
Wisconsin lottery officials said early Thursday that a winning ticket was sold at the Lakeside Country Store in Walworth County in the southern part of the state.
The Multi-State Lottery Association, which runs Powerball, confirmed that a winning ticket was sold in Wisconsin. But director Charles Strutt called that unofficial because results had not yet been certified by an auditor.
He said no official results will be reported until the participating 20 states and District of Columbia lotteries reported their audited results.
The jackpot, estimated earlier at $175 million, was raised to $194.4 million just before the drawing. Lottery officials said sales totaled $138.5 million for Wednesday's drawing.
Mike Evans of Roy, Utah, drove to Idaho to buy tickets for the multistate lottery.
"I came up for the blinding chance of never having to work again in my life ... Somebody has to win this."
The longest lines were in towns near states that don't participate in the game. New Yorkers poured into Greenwich, Conn., with one man buying 4,000 tickets Wednesday morning.
"They're coming in hordes and congesting the roadways. We have lines two blocks long," said police Sgt. John Brown, who bought one ticket for each member of his family.
The Travel Emporium, a convenience store along the Indiana Toll Road a few miles west of the Ohio line, had lines of up to 150 people all morning.
Many ticket buyers spent their time in line chatting about how they would spend the winnings. Among the usual answers - houses, cars and expensive vacations - were some more charitable causes.
"I would probably build another domestic violence shelter in the state and come up with schooling for unwanted kinds," said Reinna Fraaken of Des Moines.
The odds of correctly picking all six numbers were 80.1 million-to-1.
Charles Strutt, executive director of the Multi-State Lottery Association, which operates Powerball, said there was an 80 percent chance that at least one ticket would have all the right numbers and a 60 percent to 70 percent chance of two or more winners.
The winner can choose a lump-sum payment of about $104 million before taxes, or $7.7 million per year, before taxes, for 25 years.
Last year's Christmas lottery drawing in Spain - named "El Gordo," or "the Fat One" - had a $270 million purse, but it was not a winner-take-all lottery; the drawing offered 130 grand prizes of about $2 million each. Wednesday's Powerball drawing represents the world's biggest jackpot that could be won by one person.
A glitch was affecting how the drawing would be broadcast. The satellite that is used to send Powerball drawings live to 88 stations rolled out of position Tuesday night. The association planned to use another satellite.
Stanley Thomas, a building restorer, took a break from his work at a Kansas City, Mo., hotel to plunk down $5 for five chances to win.
"They say you have a better chance of dying falling out of bed than winning the lottery," Thomas said. "You've got to try. After all, it's only money."
Tickets for the game are sold in Washington, D.C., Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
