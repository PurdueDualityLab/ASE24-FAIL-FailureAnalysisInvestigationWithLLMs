Hopeful to get theirhands on the $175 million lottery jackpot - the largest in U.S. history - Powerball players yesterday swarmed vendors around the District, buying almost 5,000 tickets a minute.
Last night the winning Powerball numbers were 4, 9, 30, 34 and 48. The Powerball number was 8.
The Powerball fever evenhit the White House, where Press Secretary Michael McCurry was 45 minutes late for his 1 p.m. daily briefing because "I was in line getting my Powerball ticket."
Mr. McCurry predictedthat a victory in the sweepstakes would have him calling in to quit today and on a jet this afternoon on the first of many vacations.
Powerball, a gameadministered by the West Des Moines, Iowa-based Multi-State Lottery Association, is played in 20 states and the District.
With each $1 ticket,Powerball players try to match five numbers drawn from a pool of 49, plus a Powerball number drawn from a series of 42. The odds of winning are 1 in 80.1 million.
Charles Strutt, MSLA'sexecutive director, said that winners can choose a lump-sum payment of about $84 million before taxes, or $7 million per year, before taxes, for 25 years.
Nobody hit Saturday's record $119 million jackpot.
By midafternoon yesterdayticket sales at convenience stores, liquor stores, restaurants and other locations across the District totaled 2.2 million, topping Tuesday's 2.1 million tickets. Powerball was a popular conversation topic on the streets, at home and at the office.
"It's like a big partyhere," Athena Ware, D.C. lottery spokeswoman said as she watched people line up wishing for last- minute luck and a half-hour wait at the Tenley Mini Mart on Wisconsin Avenue NW.
Local radio andtelevision stations camped out at the site where a lucky Washingtonian, still unidentified, won $100,000 on Saturday - 22 others scattered across 20 states, who participate in the game administered by the Multi-State Lottery Association, also won $100,000.
Paul and Gale Levy,owners of Capitol Chicken on 14th Street, between I and K streets NW, were serving up Powerball tickets along with their rotisserie chicken, collard greens, cornbread and other home-cooked food.
Regulars and noviceslined up outside the door in a long line three times as long as the food line. "The food is very good here," said Sarah Frazier, 57, a retiree who didn't mind the 10- to 15- minute wait.
"I got my one ticket,"Mr. Levy, 62, said pulling out a stuffed, tattered wallet that contained it. Mrs. Levy, 58, is also participating in about four or five different pools. "I'm the gambler here," she said. She is also the ticket agent who each day taps out tickets for customers as Mr. Levy cooks.
The Levys, of Bowie, wereoriginal agents when the lottery began about 20 years ago. They have been in business in the District since 1957, when they opened a drugstore.
Also yesterday, a serious glitchwas affecting how the drawing would be broadcast. The satellite that is used to send Powerball drawings live to 88 stations, known as Galaxy 4, rolled out of position Tuesday night. The association planned to use another satellite to air the event.
Tickets for Powerball aresold in the District, Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
