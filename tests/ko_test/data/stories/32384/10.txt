TORONTO, Jan 31, 2005 (ODC via COMTEX) --
Canada imported C$1.3 billion more from the U.S. in November than originally reported in Canadian trade data for the month, according to revisions published on Monday. Canadian imports from the U.S. totaled C$19.5 billion in November, revised up from C$18.2 billion originally reported on Jan. 12, according to report published by Statistics Canada on Monday. The previous data were based on incomplete records due to a computer glitch at customs, the government's statistics agency said Monday. Overall, imports fell 4% to C$29.30 billion in November, revised from the 10.2% decline to C$27.41 billion that Statistics Canada first announced on Jan. 12. The 2.9% drop in exports to C$34.71 billion was unchanged. As a result, November's trade surplus was revised down to C$5.41 billion from a preliminary C$7.30 billion. "A technical problem at Canada Border Agency led to the transmission of incomplete customs records to Statistics Canada for November," StatsCan said. The federal statistics agency said it has been assured that the technical glitch has been identified and resolved. -By Don Curren; Dow Jones Newswires;416-306-2020; don.curren@dowjones.com
