TORONTO, Jan 31, 2005 (ODC via COMTEX) --
The Canadian dollar ended little changed after a session of choppy, rangebound trading on Monday. The U.S. dollar was trading at C$1.2412 at 3:54 p.m. EST (2054 GMT), from C$1.2417 at 8:00 a.m. EST (1300 GMT), and from C$1.2404 late Friday. The U.S. dollar fluctuated around the C$1.2400 level during the session, hitting a peak of C$1.2446 in early trading but then dropping to a C$1.2263 in afternoon activity. It reverted to the C$1.2400 area in late trading, climbing modestly towards the end of the session. News that gross domestic product grew 0.2% in November, slightly lower than the expected 0.3% month-on-month gain, was seen as consistent with expectations of continued steady monetary policy from the Bank of Canada, and failed to have a marked impact on the exchange rate. The currency also failed to react significantly to news that the November trade surplus was revised down to C$5.41 billion because imports dropped at a much slower pace than reported earlier. Previous data were based on incomplete records due to a computer glitch at customs, Statistics Canada said Monday. The market is likely going to remain in a fairly quiet posture at least until the results of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy-setting open market committee meeting are released on Wednesday, market watchers said. "I think we're just waiting for the Fed on (Feb. 2) for some direction," said Don Mikolich, executive director of foreign exchange for CIBC World Markets. While a 25-basis-point increase in the federal funds target rate is widely expected, the U.S. central bank's policy statement will be closely scrutinized to see if its wording suggests a steady pace of monetary tightening in the coming months, he said. A 25-basis-point increase in the federal funds target rate will bring it to the same level as its equivalent in Canada, the overnight target rate. Market players are still unsure whether the disappearance of Canada's yield advantage will result in serious selling pressure on the Canadian dollar, or whether it will be offset by other factors.
"It may be a little bit early, still, to put the official decision on that, yet," Mikolich said. In the next few sessions, the U.S. Canadian dollar pair will remain in recent trading ranges, he said. On a short-term basis, C$1.2430 will offer resistance, although the U.S. dollar seems to be having a hard time even staying above C$1.2410, Mikolich said. The currency pair could be somewhat data-driven in the coming sessions, he added. The Institute of Supply Management's manufacturing index for January will be released on Tuesday. The most significant data releases of the week will be January jobs data for both Canada and the U.S. on Friday. These are the exchange rates at 3:54 p.m. EST (2054 GMT), 8:00 a.m. EST (1300 GMT), and late Friday.
