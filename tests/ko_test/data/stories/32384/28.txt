Canadian, U.S. December data to be served up this morning
Statistics Canada is scheduled to release December merchandise trade figures this morning.
Let's hope everything goes a little more smoothly this time.
Underscoring the volatility of monthly trade data, Statscan last week issued a startling $1.9-billion downward revision to November's trade surplus, citing a computer glitch at the Canada Border Services Agency that caused a massive understatement of imports.
Instead of a merchandise trade surplus of $7.3-billion, the true figure for November was closer to $5.4-billion, Statscan said.
With that little matter out of the way, predicting December's trade figures should be a walk in the park, right? Well, not exactly.
"The Canadian trade number in any particular month is a crapshoot, as the headline is subject to significant revisions," said David Watt, senior economist with BMO Nesbitt Burns. Yet another revision to the November tally is possible today, he said.
Despite monthly figures being subject to noise, currency traders pay close attention to the data. When the November figures were first reported, they helped lift the Canadian dollar more than a cent against the U.S. greenback.
For December, forecasts for the merchandise surplus vary widely, ranging from a high of $6.6-billion to a low of $4.6-billion, according to a Bloomberg survey of 21 economists.
The average estimate is $5.4-billion, which would leave the surplus unchanged from November.
Economists expecting a wider surplus say strong U.S. vehicle sales and industrial production likely lifted Canadian exports. Those predicting a smaller surplus point to lower prices for oil and other commodity exports.
Regardless of who is right, the inherent volatility of monthly trade figures underscores why "markets should not place too much faith on this series in isolation," said economist Carl Gomez of Toronto-Dominion Bank.
In the United States, the Commerce Department also serves up December trade data this morning.
Economists expect a goods and services trade deficit of about $57-billion (U.S.). November's record deficit of $60.3-billion will also likely be revised downward, owing to the same computer gremlins that mucked up the Canadian data.
Also today, Statscan gives its latest read on the housing market with its new-home price index for December. Economists expect prices to rise about 5 per cent year over year. In earnings news, Canadian Tire Corp. Ltd. , Dell Inc. , Shoppers Drug Mart Ltd. , Thomson Corp. , CP Ships Ltd. and Nexen Inc. are among companies expected to report.
