The U.S.trade deficit improved in December, but the American consumer's appetite for imported goods led to another record trade gap in 2004, new figures show.
In December, the U.S. trade deficit narrowed by 4.9pc to USD56.4bn, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.
The narrowing of the trade deficit was in line with the consensus forecast of Wall Street economists, who were expecting a deficit of USD56.9bn.
For all of 2004, the U.S. recorded a record trade deficit of USD617.7bn, or 5.3pc of GDP. This compares with a deficit of USD496.5bn, or 4.5pc of GDP in 2003. As expected, Commerce lowered its estimate of the November trade gap to USD59.3bn from the initial estimate of USD60.3bn after Canada announced that a glitch in its data collection led to an under-estimate of imports from the U.S. in the month. In December, exports rose faster than imports. The U.S. imported less oil in December and the price of the oil had the largest monthly drop in over a decade.
