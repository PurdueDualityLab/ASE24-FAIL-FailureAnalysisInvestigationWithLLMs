U.S. Dec. trade gap narrows to $56.4 billion - UPDATE 1 WASHINGTON (CBS.MW) - The trade deficit improved in December, but the U. S. consumer's appetite for imported goods led to another record trade gap in 2004, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. In December, the U.S. trade deficit narrowed by 4.9 percent to $56.4 billion. The narrowing of the trade deficit was in line with the consensus forecast of Wall Street economists, who were expecting a deficit of $56.9 billion. For all of 2004, the U.S. recorded a record trade deficit of $617.7 billion, or 5.3 percent of GDP. This compares with a deficit of $496.5 billion, or 4.5 percent of GDP in 2003. Economists said the trade data would lead to an upward revision in U.S. Q4 GDP growth. Matt Johnson, chief economist at ThinkEquity Partners, said the trade growth could be revised to 4.0 percent from the initial estimate of 3.3 percent.
As expected, Commerce lowered its estimate of the November trade gap to $59.3 billion from the initial estimate of $60.3 billion after Canada announced that a glitch in its data collection led to an under-estimate of imports from the U.S. in the month. In December, exports rose faster than imports. Exports of goods and services rose 3.2 percent to a record $100.2 billion. This is the largest monthly increase in exports since July 2004. The U.S. exported a record amount of industrial supplies, autos and auto parts and consumer goods in December. Imports of goods and services rose a slim 0.1 percent to a record $156.6 billion. Imports were held down by a 9.3 percent decline in imported oil in December. The U.S. imported less oil in December and the price of the oil had the largest monthly drop in over a decade. The U. S. imported 321.1 million barrels of crude oil in December or 10.4 million barrels per day, down from 326.5 million or 10.9 million barrels, in November. The average price per barrel of oil fell to $36.63 in December from $41.15 in November. This is the largest month to month drop since February 1991. For all of 2004, the U.S. set record trade gaps with four countries: Canada, Mexico, China and Japan. It also set record annual deficits with the European Union and South and Central America. The U.S. trade gap with China hit a record $162 billion in 2004, up 30.6 percent from $124.1 billion in 2003. Imports from China rose to $196.7 billion, compared with $152.4 billion in the previous year. The U.S. imported a record 3.8 billion barrels of crude oil in 2004. Economists at Merrill Lynch said the dollar's weakness over the past two years will finally have an impact on the trade deficit. "We find that exports have responded strongly to dollar weakness, while imports have progressed even more strongly, preventing an adjustment in the trade balance. Our model indicates that conditions are ripe for a reversal in this trend, predicting the trade deficit will bottom in the first quarter of 2005," the Merrill Lynch report said.
