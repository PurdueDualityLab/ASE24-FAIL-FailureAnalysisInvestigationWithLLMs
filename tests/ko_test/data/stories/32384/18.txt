Trade data not so scary once Statscan chased away gremlins

Statistics Canada just gave me another reason to cling steadfastly to my (occasionally irrational) mistrust of technology.
Statscan revealed yesterday that a computer glitch at the Canada Border Services Agency caused it to overstate the November trade surplus by more than 25 per cent. The new figure is $5.4-billion, down from the near-record $7.3-billion Statscan reported on Jan. 12.
Setting aside any worries about the release of market-moving numbers that turn out to be glaringly inaccurate (the Canadian dollar surged the day of the original release, while Canadian stocks underperformed their U.S. counterparts), this revision is actually a happy one for market watchers. The entire restatement came from imports; it turns out Canada's domestic demand wasn't anywhere near as anemic as the original numbers had implied.
(For all of you who believed the original report was a statistical anomaly, pat yourselves on the back, say 'told you so' and take an extra-long lunch. Smarty pants.) The big surplus reported earlier this month was not the kind of surplus you celebrate. Exports were down, and the only reason the surplus was so big was because imports appeared to fall into a black hole - off 10.2 per cent.
Statscan had trouble coming up with an adequate explanation at the time, which makes sense now that we know that some Commodore 64 down at the customs office took a snooze and missed a couple of billion dollars' worth of stuff entering our borders. Um, oops.
The revised import figures show a much more digestible 4-per-cent decline. You can account for almost the entire fall through price changes stemming from the stronger Canadian dollar, which rose about 3 per cent against its U.S. counterpart in November. A Statscan spokeswoman confirmed that actual volumes of imports in November were little changed from October.
Instead of an alarming, inexplicable slowdown in domestic demand for imports, we have a less worrisome flattening in buying. As Statscan surmised in the original report, that may be related to importers taking a breather to work down the inventories they had built up in previous months.
That's pretty much in line with what the Bank of Canada reiterated in last week's Monetary Policy Report Update - that the expensive dollar is eroding exports, but the domestic market is still on track. That should provide a solid base of support for Canadian stocks and the economy.
The trade-data gaffe also provides a lesson about giving too much weight to a single economic report. The numbers in any given month are little more than a snapshot, and taken alone, they can be misleading, if not downright deceitful. Even if the original November data had been accurate, numbers that far out of line with the trend provoke more questions than answers. They demand patience; the next round of data can either support them as the start of a new direction or dismiss them as a statistical hiccup. The restatement solves the November report's big riddle; the December trade numbers on Feb. 10 should help clarify the broader trade picture.
The revised trade numbers and a respectable 0.2-per-cent rise in Canadian gross domestic product in November helped underpin a solid day for Toronto stocks. The S&P/TSX composite index advanced 62.27 points to 9,204.05, despite a 0.9-per-cent pullback in the gold sector as gold prices retreated following the Iraqi elections.
Traders were generally in an upbeat mood in the wake of the elections, which went off more smoothly than many observers had feared, easing some of the geopolitical risk that remains under the surface of North American markets. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 62.74 points to 10,489.94, the S&P 500 gained 9.92 points to 1,181.27 and the Nasdaq composite jumped 26.58 points to 2,062.41. U.S. stocks were also buoyed by a 0.8-per-cent rise in U.S. consumer spending and a 3.7-per-cent jump in personal income in December, as well as a flurry of U.S. takeover news.
Oil markets initially saw some relief in the wake of the Iraq vote, but reversed course amid concerns that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries might still slash production, despite the cartel's decision over the weekend to maintain output quotas for the time being. Crude closed at $48.20 (U.S.) a barrel in New York, up $1.02, after flirting with $46 in the morning.
With heavy winter heating demand still underpinning energy prices, and OPEC signalling that won't allow a supply glut to build and send prices below $40 this spring, crude looks stuck in the mid-$40s range for the time being.
