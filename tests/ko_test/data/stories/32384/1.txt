An error in Canadian trade figures underestimated US exports to its northern neighbor, officials said Monday. Economists said the corrected figures could lead to an upward revision of US economic growth.
Economists said the new data could lead to an upgrade of US gross domestic product growth for the fourth quarter to 3.3 percent from the estimate last Friday of 3.1 percent.
Steve Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital, said Canadian trade data is used in compilation of US trade statistics and that the boost of over one billion dollars to US exports in November would work out to roughly 0.2 percentage points to US GDP for the quarter.
Tom Porcelli at Merrill Lynch agreed, saying, 'fourth quarter US GDP could be revised to about 3.3 percent, from 3.1 percent reported Friday.'
Statistics Canada said earlier in the day that 'a technical problem at Canada Border Services Agency led to the transmission of incomplete customs records to Statistics Canada for November.'
The Canadian agency said the new data showed US exports to Canada of 19.5 billion dollars in November, up from an earlier estimate of 18.2 billion.
