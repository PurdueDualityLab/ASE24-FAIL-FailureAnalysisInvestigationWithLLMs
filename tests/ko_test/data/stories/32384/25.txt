WASHINGTON, Feb 10 (AFP) -
The US trade deficit narrowed 4.9 percent in December, to 56.4 billion dollars, but still hit an annual record for 2004 of 617.7 billion dollars, the Commerce Department said Thursday.
The record deficit in trade of goods and services for 2004 resulted from the growing consumer appetite for imports, along with surging oil prices. Imports were not dented by a weak dollar.
The narrowing of the December trade deficit was in line with the consensus forecast of Wall Street economists, who were expecting a deficit of 57 billion dollars.
As expected, the Commerce Department lowered its estimate of the November trade gap to 59.3 billion dollars from the initial estimate of 60.3 billion after Canada announced that a glitch in its data collection led to an underestimate of imports from the United States in the month.
Exports of goods and services rose 3.2 percent to a record 100.2 billion dollars. This is the largest monthly increase in exports since July 2004.
Imports meanwhile edged up 0.1 percent to 156.6 billion dollars, due to a moderation in crude oil prices and a small dip in consumer goods imports.
For all of 2004, the US recorded a record trade deficit of 617.7 billion dollars, or 5.3 percent of gross domestic product. This compares with a deficit of 496.5 billion, or 4.5 percent of GDP, in 2003.
The US trade gap with China hit a record 162 billion dollars in 2004, up 30.6 percent from 2003. The deficit narrowed slightly in December to 14.2 billion dollars from 16.6 billion in November.
The United States imported a record 3.8 billion barrels of crude oil in 2004.
Economist Marie-Pierre Ripert at IXIS Corporate and Investment Bank said the figures may allow an upward revision of US economic growth in the fourth quarter, but that the trend remains troublesome.
"We expect the trade deficit to continue to widen in 2005 even if the dollar gets back to its downward trend," she said.
"As emphasized by (Fed chairman Alan) Greenspan last week, the dollar's decline has not triggered a rise in import prices (because of the foreign exporter's behavior), therefore there is no effect on real imports ... We are not convinced, as Greenspan seems to be, that 'the increased flexibility of the American economy will likely to facilitate any adjustment without significant consequences to aggregate economic activity.'"
