NEW YORK, Feb 03, 2005 (ODC via COMTEX) --
A Dow Jones Newswires Column
Wednesday, RateMeister Alan Greenspan did exactly what I would have done with the Fed funds target rate, and he said exactly what I would have said after he did it. So what's not to like about that? Faithful readers know that I have become breathtakingly good at forecasting exactly what the Federal Open Market Committee will do at its meetings and exactly what Greenspan will say about what the panel did. It's only natural, therefore, that some readers will believe that Greenspan and I are friends, and that he's always slipping me the skinny. The truth is that Greenspan wouldn't know me if I fell on him from the sky. Now it's full speed ahead to the March 22 FOMC meeting where we get another 25-basis-point increase in the Fed funds target rate and pretty much the exact same post-meeting statement that we got on Wednesday afternoon. Of course, things could change. Do you take me for a turnip? March 22 is almost two months away. Plus, Big Al is up on Capitol Hill on Feb. 16 and Feb. 17 to deliver his semiannual report on monetary policy and the economy. The exercise used to be known as the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, but the federal law of the same name "sunsetted," as they say inside the Beltway. Also remember that we won't have to wait until after March 22 to get the minutes of the Tuesday-Wednesday FOMC meeting. Now we get minutes between meetings. The minutes of the just concluded meeting come out Feb. 23.
Four On The Floor
I wouldn't characterize the U.S. economic indicator lineup Thursday as socko. but one of the four items on the menu clearly stands out: That's the 8:30 a.m. EST report on nonfarm productivity in the fourth quarter of 2004. Most professionals are looking for a notable drop in productivity in the fourth quarter, which also means a concomitant notable rise in unit labor costs. The Dow Jones consensus forecast arrived at in a poll of 17 economists is that productivity rose 1.2% in October-December 2004 versus a gain of 1.8% in the third quarter. If so, unit labor costs would rise by 2.5% versus a 1.8% increase in the third quarter. The drop in U.S. nonfarm productivity last quarter could make for several diverting headlines. For example, Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP, points out that if his forecast for a tepid 1.0% gain in 4Q productivity comes true, it would mark "the smallest quarterly gain in nearly four years." At 10:00 a.m. EST, most forecasters believe the Institute for Supply Management will report a two- to four-point drop in the nonmanufacturing index for January. If so, that would leave the index in the 60-61 neighborhood, which is still plenty upscale. Above 50, declines in this index signal not contraction but slowing of growth. Which leaves us with weekly unemployment claims at 8:30 a.m. EST and December factory orders at 10:00 a.m. EST, neither of which bids fair to be a player. I shan't waste your time, therefore, with further treatment of the two. You may be sure, however, that if this column lacked its accustomed yardage I could discourse at length about both. That, incidentally, brings up an insight that few outsiders have into the news media; namely, that space and time considerations are usually the most important factors in the coverage we give stories, not news value. Also, let's not forget that today is the day the big U.S. retailers report January sales. Did the redemption of billions of dollars of gift cards lend extra zip to sales last month? Costco, as usual, led off the parade at 4:00 a.m. EST. Costco said sales in U.S. stores open a year or more rose 3.0% in the four weeks ended Jan. 30, which is rather tepid for Costco. The company added, however, that the tepidity reflected application of a new way of accounting for manufacturers' "sales incentives."
Way Shy Of The Mark
Friday, in its first of three reports on U.S. gross domestic product in the fourth quarter of 2004, the Commerce Department said that GDP rose by 3.1%, disappointing the consensus crowd, which was looking for 3.5%. Now we know that 3.1% was way low. We'll see a revision to at least 3.5% growth when Commerce reports on 4Q GDP for a second time, which for some reason is called the "preliminary report." With chunks of fourth-quarter retail sales data still on the way, as well as fresh data on U.S. inventories through year-end, an upward revision in 4Q GDP growth to 4.0% is not beyond the pale. We're going to get at least 3.5%, though, because Statistics Canada, owing to a technical glitch, underestimated U.S. exports to Canada in November and U.S. construction spending was a lot stronger in the fourth quarter than first thought. Don't be surprised by the sharp upward revision in fourth-quarter GDP growth. The markets won't be. Nor will I because I read John McAuley's story on Dow Jones Newswires on Wednesday, which was headlined, "4Q GDP Too Low Even Before The Ink Dries."
