Washington (Platts)-31Jan2005/439 pm EST/2139 GMT An error in Canadian trade figures underestimated US exports to its northern neighbor, officials said Monday. Economists said the corrected figures could lead to an upgrade of US gross domestic product growth for the fourth quarter to 3.3% from the estimate last Friday of 3.1%. Steve Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital, said Canadian trade data is used in compilation of US trade statistics and that the boost of over $1-bil to US exports in November would work out to roughly 0.2% to US GDP for the quarter.
Tom Porcelli at Merrill Lynch agreed, saying, "fourth-quarter US GDP could be revised to about 3.3% from 3.1% reported Friday." Statistics Canada said earlier in the day that "a technical problem at Canada Border Services Agency led to the transmission of incomplete customs records to Statistics Canada for November." The Canadian agency said the new data showed US exports to Canada of $19.5-bil in November, up from an earlier estimate of $18.2-bil.
