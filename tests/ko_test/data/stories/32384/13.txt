- The U.S. trade deficit narrowed by 4.9 percent in December to $56.4 billion, the Commerce Department said Thursday. The narrowing of the trade deficit was in line with the consensus forecast of Wall Street economists, who were expecting a deficit of $56.9 billion. Exports rose faster than imports in December. For all of 2004, the U.S. set a record trade deficit of $617.7 billion, or 5.3 percent of GDP. As expected, Commerce lowered its estimate of the November trade gap to $59.3 billion from the initial estimate of $60.3 billion after Canada announced that a glitch in its data collection led to an under-estimate of imports from the U.S. in the month.
