Trade gap not expected to be as bad as feared

WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- The trade sector will not be the large drag on economic growth in the first quarter as had been initially feared, economists said.
'The idea that export growth is tanking and could well bring the economy with it was overblown,' said Ken Goldstein, an economist at the Conference Board.
Late last month, the Commerce Department estimated that fourth-quarter growth at a 3.1 percent rate, down from a 4 percent rate in the third quarter, laying the blame squarely on weak U.S. exports.
The department calculated that the economy would have grown at a 4.8 percent annual rate in the October-December quarter if the trade sector was excluded.
But now the export sector has been granted a pardon. It turns out that a glitch in Canada's statistical agency underestimated imports from the United States by about $1 billion.
'Trade is not the albatross around the neck of this economy,' Goldstein added.
On Thursday, Commerce will detail how much this mistake impacted on their initial estimate of a record trade gap of $60.3 billion in November. They will also release their estimate of the trade gap in December and for the entire year.
Analysts expect a downward revision to the November trade gap. In addition, the consensus forecast of Wall Street economists is for the December trade gap to slip further to $57.6 billion. Imports are expected to fall because of sharply lower oil prices.
The trade data will be released on Thursday at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.
Economists said this means that U.S. gross domestic product could be revised up to 3.5 percent growth, at least.
Overall, despite the improvement in the last two months, the deficit will set a new annual record for 2004, easily beating last year's record.
But this is old news. By the end of October, it was already larger than the record annual deficit of $496.5 billion set in 2003.
Analysts expect record trade deficits in 2005 and 2006.
Export growth has to be almost twice as fast as import growth to avoid that, 'and that is not going to happen anytime soon,' said Stephen Gallagher, chief U.S. economist at Societe Generale Corporate and Investment Banking.
Economists were not so sure about Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's optimistic prediction that market forces 'appear poised' to cause the trade deficit to correct.
'One of the dictates for economists is to give a number or a date, but don't give them both. Greenspan said market forces would help bring about a correction in the current account, but I think he was very careful and very smart not to put a date on it,' said Goldstein of the Conference Board.
