BEA Says Canada Trade Correction Will Affect US 4Q GDP

WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Data on U.S. economic growth at the end of 2004 will be affected by a correction to Canada trade figures, a Commerce Department agency said Monday.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis didn't give details on the nature or size of the effect to U.S. data from Canada's error.
But the agency did say the correction will have an impact on calculations of the November trade balance and fourth-quarter gross domestic product.
The Commerce Department reported Friday fourth-quarter GDP increased at an annual rate of 3.1%, weaker than the third quarter's 4.0% climb.
Earlier Monday, a Canada government statistical agency said it underestimated November 2004 imports from the U.S. in a Jan. 12 release.
"The United States uses the Statistics Canada estimates of imports of goods from the United States in preparing estimates of U.S. goods and services trade and of U.S. gross domestic product," the BEA said in a statement released shortly after 4 p.m. Eastern time.
"As a result, the correction of the Statistics Canada estimate will have an impact on U.S. calculations of goods and services trade for November and of U.S. GDP for the fourth quarter of 2004," the BEA said.
The Commerce Department agency said its estimates are based on a variety of source data that are regularly revised and updated, so revisions coming from a single source may not be indicative of future revised estimates. Revised data on goods and services trade for November, and preliminary data for December, will appear in the next regularly scheduled trade release, on Feb. 10. Revised estimates of GDP for the fourth quarter of 2004 will appear in the next regularly scheduled GDP release, on Feb. 25.
"These estimates will incorporate the revised data on U.S. exports as well as other newly available and revised source data that will be available at that time," the BEA said.
While analysts had been predicting GDP would weaken during October through December because of a drag by the trade sector, the 3.1% GDP growth figure issued Friday fell well short of expectations on Wall Street - and also marked the lowest rate of growth since the economy rose 1.9% in the first quarter of 2003 as falling exports and rising imports took a bite out of economic momentum.
A Dow Jones Newswires-CNBC survey of 20 economists had forecast GDP growth of 3.6%.
Analysts Monday said Canada's undercounting of U.S. exports to the northern nation could likely mean the economy grew faster than 3.1% in the last three months of 2004.
"Specifically, a $1 billion boost to exports in November would work out to roughly 0.2 percentage points to GDP for the quarter (i.e. from 3.1% to 3.3%)," RBS Greenwich Capital economist Steve Stanley said in prepared analysis issued before BEA's release.
And Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist of High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., said in a note to clients Monday before the BEA statement: "A number nearer to 3-1/2% would reinforce the impression that the Fed is right to continue steadily raising rates."
The Canadian government agency Statistics Canada on Monday reported Canadian imports from the U.S. totaled C$19.5 billion in November. That's a revision up from the C$18.2 billion originally reported on Jan. 12.
The earlier data were based on incomplete records due to a computer glitch at customs, Statistics Canada said. "A technical problem at Canada Border Agency led to the transmission of incomplete customs records to Statistics Canada for November," StatsCan said. The federal statistics agency said it has been assured that the technical glitch has been identified and resolved.
