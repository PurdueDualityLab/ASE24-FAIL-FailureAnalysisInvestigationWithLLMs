Canada's trade balance slipped slightly in December as imports of products such as automobiles and machinery grew while the export sector struggled with the strong Canadian dollar, suggesting the domestic economy remains fairly robust and the Bank of Canada will stay on the policy sidelines. As previously reported, Canada's trade surplus shrank by nearly C$300 million in December to C$5.21 billion. The mean forecast of economists surveyed by Thomson IFR Bonddata was for a surplus of C$5.1 billion. The November trade surplus was revised to C$5.49 billion in Thursday's release. It was initially reported at C$7.3 billion, but was subsequently revised to C$5.41 billion when Statistics Canada reported in late January that November trade data had been marred by a technical glitch. Exports in December increased 2.6% to C$36.48 billion while imports were up 4.0% to C$31.27 billion. The data reflect an economy where the export sector struggles with an elevated Canadian dollar, but the domestic sector remains reasonably vigorous. Analysts say it's also consistent with expectations that the Bank of Canada will remain on the policy sidelines, providing the stimulus required to bolster domestic demand while the export sector battles with the effects of the higher exchange rate. "Taken at face value, today's trade report suggests that the surplus is beginning to fade, but more because of solid import growth and not a big weakening in exports. While not great news for the C$, it suggests that the economy is still managing quite well in the face of a strong (Canadian dollar)," said an email report from Sherry Cooper, chief economist at BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc.
Import Growth Belies Talk Of Soft Domestic Demand
Cooper noted that, in volume terms, exports managed a 1.3% advance, but imports were stronger with a 2.8% increase in real terms. "Note that the volume of imports is up 12.2% (year-over-year), making a mockery of talk of soft domestic demand. Real exports are up a more muted, but still respectable, 4.1% (year-over-year)," Cooper wrote. The surplus for all of 2004 rose to C$67.2 billion from C$58.2 billion in 2003, on export growth of 7.6% and import gains of 6.2%, she wrote. The prime areas of strength in exports in December were energy, autos and industrial goods, with machinery and equipment, food, and forest product sales declining, Cooper wrote. Rising imports and falling exports mean that trade will continue to act as a drag on the economy for both fourth-quarter growth numbers and also into 2005, Ivana Rupcic, economist at RBC Financial Markets Group. "On a positive note, imports of machinery and equipment (M&E) rose 3.2% in December. This is particularly important in that it bodes well for Canadian productivity," Rupcic wrote. "With between 70-80% of all M&E equipment in Canada imported from the United States, this is one area where a higher Canadian dollar is good news. Canadian companies can import productivity-enhancing equipment at more attractive prices since the dollar is stronger," she wrote. "On both sides of the trade ledger, you saw a recovery in flows, both imports and exports (in December)," said Warren Lovely, senior economist at CIBC World Markets. But the outlook remains cloudy for Canada's trade balance, with continued pressure from the high Canadian dollar likely to weigh on export-oriented production, Lovely said.
Carrying A Heavy Burden
"The year maybe ended on a slightly brighter note, but there's considerable challenges, considerable hurdles, still ahead for the export-oriented factory sector in particular," he said. Over the fourth quarter as a whole, real exports are down, continuing the weakness that surfaced in the third quarter, Lovely said. "Canada's trade surplus, in real terms in particular, has shrunk considerably. Exports really haven't grown in the second half of the year, whereas imports were rising pretty steadily," he said. "It's consistent with an economy that's been forced to carry a very heavy burden in the form of currency appreciation," Lovely said. It's also consistent with continued steady policy at the Bank of Canada, unless the Canadian dollar begins to appreciate sharply again. "Should you see a renewed bout of Canadian dollar strength...don't be surprised if the Bank of Canada gets really alarmed about that," Lovely said. "It could ultimately mean the bank's next move is a cut, not a hike, but that remains to be seen." Carolyn Kwan, financial markets economist at Scotia Capital, said Thursday's trade data were consistent with continued steady monetary policy at the Bank of Canada. "I don't think this trade number is going to change the Bank of Canada's expectations too much. They are going to be on hold for the near term. That's pretty certain for now," Kwan said. An email report from Ted Carmichael, senior economist at JP Morgan Canada, said JP Morgan's growth forecast will remain unchanged at 2.0% at at annual rates after the trade data. Net exports had a larger negative impact on growth and domestic demand made a more positive contribution than previously expected, Carmichael wrote.
