OTTAWA, Jan 31, 2005 (ODC via COMTEX) --
Canada's November trade surplus was revised down to C$5.41 billion because imports dropped at a much slower pace than reported earlier as the previous data were based on incomplete records due to a computer glitch at customs, the government's statistics agency said Monday. Imports fell 4% to C$29.30 billion, revised from the 10.2% decline to C$27.41 billion that Statistics Canada first announced on Jan. 12. The 2.9% drop in exports to C$34.71 billion was unchanged. As a result, November's trade surplus was revised down from a preliminary C$7.30 billion. "A technical problem at Canada Border Agency led to the transmission of incomplete customs records to Statistics Canada for November," the agency said. Statistics Canada said it has been assured that the technical glitch has been identified and resolved. The agency will release detailed revisions when it issues the December data on Feb. 10.
