WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--A Commerce Department agency says it will post information online about possible effects to U.S. gross domestic product from a Canada trade data revision.
Ralph Stewart, a spokesman for the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis, said the agency planned to post the information Monday afternoon regarding the revision.
"It will be a statement basically describing if it is going to affect our GDP estimates," he said.
In a release Friday, Commerce said fourth-quarter GDP rose at a 3.1% annual rate.
The Canadian government's statistics agency said that nation's November trade surplus was revised down to C$5.41 billion because imports dropped at a much slower pace than reported earlier. The previous data were based on incomplete records due to a computer glitch at customs.
Imports fell 4% to C$29.30 billion, revised from the 10.2% decline to C$27.41 billion that Statistics Canada first announced on Jan. 12. The 2.9% drop in exports to C$34.71 billion was unchanged.
As a result, November's trade surplus was revised down from a preliminary C$7.30 billion.
"A technical problem at Canada Border Agency led to the transmission of incomplete customs records to Statistics Canada for November," the agency said.
Statistics Canada said it has been assured that the technical glitch has been identified and resolved.
