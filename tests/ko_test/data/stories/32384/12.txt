Statistics Canada dramatically revised the country's November trade surplus downward Monday after a technical glitch skewed import figures for the month.
Some economists also suggested, because of the impact of the change on U.S. data, fourth-quarter growth in that country could be revised higher once all is said and done.
According to a correction published by Statscan, this country's trade surplus for the month was $5.4-billion. Originally, the surplus had been reported at a surprising $7.3-billion, the third-highest level since 1997 and just short of the $7.5-billion record set in June, 2004.
“A technical problem at Canada Border Services Agency led to the transmission of incomplete customs records to Statistics Canada for November,” the agency said.
The revised numbers showed that Canadian companies imported $29.3-billion worth of merchandise in November.
Statscan had originally pegged imports at $27.4-billion for the month. The revisions meant that imports fell about 4 per cent in November, rather than the 10.2-per-cent decline originally reported by Statscan.
Exports for the month were reported at $34.7-billion, down about 2.9 per cent from October's level. The export figures were not affected by Monday's rethink of the data.
The original release — coupled with a weak trade report out of the United States the same day — had triggered a sharp rally in the Canadian dollar, even though economists cautioned about reading too much into the Canadian trade figures.
Most remained wary of the soaring trade surplus because the gains came largely on the back of declining imports rather than because of gains by the export sector.
Monday's correction had little impact on the loonie, which was trading at 80.64 cents (U.S.), up slightly from Friday's close of 80.59 cents.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Commerce Department also said the trade revision could have an impact of economic figures south of the border.
According to wire services, the U.S. government department said it would post a statement to its web site by Monday afternoon, outlining if the new figures had any impact on U.S. gross domestic product estimates.
On Friday, the Commerce Department said the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 3.1 per cent. Economists had been expecting annual growth of about 3.5 per cent in the quarter.
But at least part of the disappointing showing was linked to weaker exports — a situation that could be changed by Monday's Statscan revision.
Merrill Lynch economist Tom Porcelli said that as a result the change to Statscan's figures U.S. exports could be revised up by $1-billion (U.S.), meaning the broader economic growth in the final quarter of the year could also be nudged higher as a result of the restatement.
“Fourth-quarter U.S. GDP could be revised to about 3.3 per cent from 3.1 per cent,” he said.
