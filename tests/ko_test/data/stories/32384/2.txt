Computer glitch inflated surplus

Canada slashed its November trade surplus Monday after a computer error distorted import data, shaking confidence in Canadian statistics and likely forcing an upward revision in U.S. growth figures.
The change, announced by a red-faced Statistics Canada, lowered by nearly $2 billion a near record November trade surplus that had raised eyebrows at the time.
The revised surplus was a relatively modest $5.4 billion, up only slightly from October's $5.2 billion, and well below the $7.3 billion reported on Jan. 12.
'It was a big enough amount for us to issue a special report,' StatsCan's director of international trade David Dodds said. '(But) it's not going to rock the economy, I think.'
But the U.S. Department of Commerce took the unusual step of warning the public it may have to revise its fourth-quarter gross domestic product estimate because of the error.
The United States and Canada are the world's biggest trading partners and U.S. statisticians use Canadian import data to calculate U.S. exports to Canada.
So if Canada underestimates imports, the United States likely underestimates exports.
Analysts said Monday they had had doubts about the Canadian trade report from the beginning because it showed that imports fell 10.2 per cent to $27.41 billion in November.
Imports actually totalled $29.3 billion, a decline of only four per cent, according to the revised figures, while StatsCan held its figure for November exports steady at $34.7 billion.
'I never believed the number,' TD Securities chief strategist Marc Levesque said. 'Ten per cent of Canada's imports just evaporate in one month? Right. And, I am Shrek.'
At the heart of the problem is a Nov. 25 change in software used by the Canada Border Services Agency, and Dodds said a 'huge file' of import data was lost in the switch from one accounting program to another.
The government said it was confident such an error would not happen again.
