TWO professional poker players who stole more than GBP 150,000 from cash machines to bankroll a Las Vegas gambling spree were each jailed for 18 months yesterday.
Brothers Mohammed Imran and Mohammed Irfan - once rated among the top poker players in the country - pocketed the cash over just three days.
They exploited a loophole in the ATM system to carry out the scam, which saw them originally accused of stealing almost GBP 500,000 A court heard yesterday that the pair often shared Las Vegas poker tables with high-rollers such as Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates but were now living off handouts from relatives.
Their lawyers asked for them not be jailed claiming they had carried out the 'donkey work' for shadowy figures allegedly behind the scam.
But Sheriff Robert Anthony QC said custody was the only appropriate sentence for such a crime.
Jailing the brothers at Glasgow Sheriff Court he told them: 'Your parts involved a substantial course of criminal conduct.
'It must have taken some time and effort to perpetrate this offence.' Earlier the court heard that the Halifax bank and the Bank of Scotland carried out an overhaul of their autoteller programming system when the two merged three years ago.
Around 400 staff in Scotland and England helped to implement the changes.
Imran Bashir, prosecuting, said that an error in the system later became apparent, although it was not known if it was deliberate. The glitch allowed Imran, 33, and Irfan, 36, to overcome the security of ATMs by using an expired Halifax Bank of Scotland keycard.
Between May 29 and June 1 2005 the brothers, both of Cumbernauld, Lanarkshire, made around 380 withdrawals at cash points across Glasgow and in casinos.
The banks eventually became aware of the scam and the card was traced to a newsagent in the city's Charing Cross. It was found that the shop's owner Shahana Shad was the sister-inlaw of Imran.
She admitted being a customer of the bank, but claimed that she had never received the card.
Suspicion then fell on Imran before police were alerted. The court heard yesterday that both men were successful poker players, with Imran once ranked at 32nd in the world.
They competed against the highrollers in Las Vegas, including Bill Gates and millionaire entrepreneur Kerry Packer.
But the theft had seen them banned from every casino in the UK.
John Hamilton, defending Irfan, said the accused had carried out the 'donkey work' for others, who both accused refused to name.
Imran's counsel Euan Dow said his client had been a gambling addict at the time of the offences.
Mr Dow added: 'He is now having to rely on handouts from his family.'
