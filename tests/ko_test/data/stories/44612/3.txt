TWO professional poker players who stole more than pounds-150,000 from cash machines to bankroll a Las Vegas gambling spree have each been jailed for 18 months.
Mohammed Imran and Mohammed Irfan pocketed the cash during a three days in 2005.
The brothers exploited a loophole in the ATM system which enabled them to carry out the lucrative scam.
A court heard yesterday they often shared Las Vegas poker tables with the likes of Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates but had latterly been reduced to living off handouts from relatives.
Their lawyers asked for them not be jailed claiming they had carried out the "donkey work" for shadowy figures allegedly behind the offence. But, Sheriff Robert Anthony QC said custody was the only appropriate sentence.
Glasgow Sheriff Court previously heard how the Halifax and Bank of Scotland carried out an overhaul of their autoteller programming system when the firms merged three years ago.
Imran Bashir, prosecuting, said an "error" in the system later became apparent : "What is clear is a member of staff communicated information of this to either the accused or other persons."
The glitch allowed Imran, 33, and Irfan, 36, to overcome the security of ATMs by simply using one expired Halifax Bank of Scotland keycard.
The court heard that between May 29 and June 1 they made around 380 withdrawals at cash points across Glasgow .
The banks eventually became aware of the scam and the card being used was traced to a newsagents in the city's Charing Cross, owned by Imran's sister-in-law Shahana Shad.
Suspicion fell on Imran, of Ashlar Avenue, and Irfan, of Birkdale Wood, both Cumbernauld.
Their homes were later raided and pounds-14,480 was found in a safe belonging to Imran. Another pounds-140,160 was discovered in Irfan's safe.
The court heard yesterday that both were successful poker players with Imran once ranked at 32nd in the world.
But the theft had seen them banned from every casino in the UK and left them with virtually no chance of being given a visa to play in the United States.
