Theft funded poker spree
TWO poker players who stole more than £150,000 to bankroll a Las Vegas gambling spree were yesterday jailed for 18 months.
Brothers Mohammed Imranand Mohammed Irfan, from Cumbernauld, Lanarkshire, were once rated among the top poker players in the country.
They also played against Microsoftbillionaire Bill Gates – but they exploited a loophole in the ATM system and stole thousands of pounds from cash machines during a three-day period.
The glitch allowedImran, 33, and Irfan, 36, to use an expired Halifax Bank of Scotland card after a change in security software. And between May and June 200 5 they made around 380 withdrawals at cash points across Glasgow.
Eventually the banks got wind of the scam, and the card was traced to a newsagent in the city's Charing Cross area.
Glasgow Sheriff Courtheard yesterday that the theft has seen them banned from every casino in the UK and left them with virtually no chance of being given a visa to play again in the United States.
John Hamilton, defendingIrfan, said the accused had carried out "donkey work" for other men, who both the accused refused to name.
Imran's counsel Euan Dow said he had been addicted to gambling at the time.
