TWO professional poker players who s tole £150,000 from cash machines to bankroll a Las Vegas trip were jailed for 18 months each yesterday.
Mohammed Imran andMohammed Irfan pocketed the cash during three days in 2005. The brothers exploited a loophole in the ATM system.
A court heard yesterday they often shared Las Vegas poker tables with the likes of Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates but had latterly been reduced to living off handouts from relatives.
Their lawyers claimed thebrothers, both of Cumbernauld, carried out the donkey work for shadowy figures behind the offence. But Sheriff Robert Anthony QC said custody was the only appropriate by stephen deal sentence for such a crime. Glasgow Sheriff Court previously heard how the Halifax and Bank of Scotland overhauled their autoteller programming system when they merged three years ago.
Imran Bashir,prosecuting, said an error in the system became apparent. The fiscal added: A member of staff at one of the two locations communicated information of this fault to either of the two accused or other persons.
The glitch allowedImran, 33, and Irfan, 36, to overcome the security of ATMs by using an expired Halifax Bank of Scotland keycard. Between May 29 and June 1, 2005, they made 380 withdrawals at cash points across Glasgow.
The card was traced to anewsagents in the citys Charing Cross. It was found the shop owner, Shahana Shad, was the sister-in-law of Imran. She claimed she had never received the card.
Suspicion then fell onImran and Irfan and police found £14,480 in a safe belonging to Imran. Another £140,160 was discovered in Irfans safe. The brothers admitted taking £154,640.
They competed againsthigh-rollers in Las Vegas, including Bill Gates and millionaire entrepreneur Kerry Packer. But the theft left them with no chance of being given a visa to play again in the US.
