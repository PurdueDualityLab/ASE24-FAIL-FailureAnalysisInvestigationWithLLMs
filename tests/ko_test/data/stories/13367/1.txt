First Security, Zions taking heat

Merger plans of First Security Corp. and Zions Bancorp. continued to take heat Monday following First Security's announcement on Friday that its first quarter results would fall far short of expectations.
And the two banks' problems have breathed new life into a federal lawsuit challenging the deal.
In a Page 1 lead story Monday, American Banker, a national banking industry newspaper, ran a story headlined 'First Security's Warning Imperils Zions Merger.'
The newspaper noted that the news produced 'blistering criticism' from institutional shareholders of the two banks' stocks, and several demanded 'that Zions at least reconsider and perhaps walk away from the deal.'
The critics are putting their money where their mouths are. First Security's shares plunged 38 percent Friday to $13.97, and Zions lost 24.5 percent to close at $38.81. In early trading Monday, both banks had recovered a fraction of Friday's losses. Zions' shares were up 0.64 percent, and First Security was up 0.22 percent.
The criticism mostly stemmed from a national conference call the two banks hastily put together Friday morning following First Security's announcement that its first quarter earnings would be as much as 27 percent -- 7 cents to 9 cents per share -- below fourth quarter 1999's 33 cents per share.
First Security said its revenues for the quarter would be 8 percent lower than last quarter's, citing fewer mortgage loan originations, higher costs for short-term funding and a January jump in loan charge-offs in its indirect car and consumer loans due to glitches in a computer program installed last October.
The conference call Friday to investors, analysts and national news media was conducted by Dale Gibbons, chief financial officer for Zions, and Brad Hardy, CFO of First Security, who tried to reassure analysts that the poor results were just a momentary setback and both sides were committed to completing the $5.9 billion merger on March 22.
But the call backfired, as investors refused to be placated by the attempt at spin control.
'This is an example of how not to do a conference
call,' said Michael S. Mayo, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, saying chief executives Harris H. Simmons of Zions and Spencer F. Eccles of First Security should have personally conducted the conference call.
'When it comes to something like this, the CEO should deliver the bad news, instead of the underlings facing the firing squad,' Mayo told American Banker.
Eccles told the Deseret News Monday that he and Simmons were, in fact, listening in on the conference call along with their legal counsel but did not participate since they are currently in the proxy period and their lawyers didn't want them to say anything that might be outside the contents of the proxy statement.
Moreover, Eccles said, the market is overreacting to First Security's first-quarter projections, noting that the company's performance has been stellar over the past year and that shouldn't be wiped out by a single-quarter.
'The piranhas are on the hunt, but we're still the same folks we always were,' Eccles said. 'Everything was in place for this merger of equals to take place on Dec. 28 , but after it was delayed it has made it that much harder for us to manage our people.'
As for the merger, Eccles reaffirmed that both he and Simmons support it and believe it will go through following the new shareholder voting date on March 22. He also reaffirmed what he and Simmons said earlier: that the projected cost savings of combining the two banks remain unchanged.
Most of the negative comments during the conference call were to the effect that First Security's poor performance is dragging down Zions, with some saying First Security is tainting the performance of Zions' stock.
Several analysts on the conference call asked why First Security's poor first-quarter earnings projections didn't constitute a 'material adverse development,' a legal term that has been cited in the past for one party deciding to back out of a merger or acquisition of another.
Eccles said Monday that his attorneys assure him that the lower first-quarter earnings do not meet the standards of a material adverse development.
Prior to the conference call Friday, Gibbons of Zions told the Deseret News that he expects Zions' first-quarter revenue and earnings to be in line with expectations, adding that, 'At this time we don't think we are experiencing the same pressures . . . ' as First Security. Zions did not return calls Monday seeking further comment.
Meanwhile, a coalition of Utahns who filed a lawsuit in September to try to stop the merger sees Friday's 'meltdown' as further ammunition for their case, which is scheduled to get its first hearing Friday before federal magistrate Judge Richard Puglisi in Salt Lake City. Puglisi, of the U.S. District Court for New Mexico, was assigned the case after Utah's federal judges excused themselves from hearing it.
George M. Allen, a Provo attorney for the coalition, said it will ask for a summary judgment to kill the merger or, failing that, a trial to be held prior to the March 22 scheduled closing of the deal.
Allen told the Deseret News Monday that Zions' defense to his case is based 'solely on the professional opinion of Brigham Young University economist James Kearl, (which states that) cost efficiencies and increased profits resulting from the merger will be passed on to banking consumers.'
Allen said Kearl's cost-efficiency analysis already suffered from the fact, 'acknowledged in his own scholarly writings,' that 'it has not been accepted by the courts in antitrust litigation.'
But because of First Security's performance problems, Allen says it is 'now essentially impossible to rely on cost and profit projections made by Zions and First Security in the summer of 1999.'
Thus, Allen said he intended to file a motion Monday afternoon, after Deseret News deadlines, asking that Kearl's affidavit testimony be stricken from the record. 'And without Professor Kearl's opinion, the summary judgment (to kill the merger) is essentially unopposed.'
Allen says the two banks have been functioning as one ever since last summer. He said he has heard from major First Security customers that senior (First Security) lending officers have had to clear new loan decisions with Zions senior management. (The two banks have insisted on calling the deal a 'merger of equals,' but the national press terms it an acquisition of First Security by Zions .)
Allen said information has reached the coalition that 'morale at First Security declined drastically, as their middle management saw that it was going to be expendable.
'I would think the Zions institutional shareholders would be particularly wary of staying in a boat which is in the process of being dragged down by the First Security anchor,' he said.
Eccles said Monday that he would not comment on current litigation other than that the deal was approved by the Justice Department, the Federal Reserve Bank Board and the Utah attorney general and that 'we don't expect any legal problem (to prevent the merger) from going forward.'
