Shares of First Security Corp and Zions Bancorp plunged on Wall Street Friday as First Security warned that its first quarter revenues and earnings would be well down from the 1999 fourth quarter.
In early trading, Zions' shares were down 29 percent, and First Security's shares were off 37 percent on the news.
Both banks hastily scheduled a national media conference call Friday morning in an attempt to assuage fears of investors and analysts that the $5.9 billion merger of the two local banking giants is still on track for closure later this month, and that it will ultimately be good for shareholders of both companies.
Friday's sell-off is believed to have cost principals in the two companies, such as Harris Simmons, president and CEO of Zions, tens of millions of dollars in paper losses. Ironically, the bank stocks were plummeting on a day when the overall stock market was soaring.
In a statement sent out prior to the conference call, First Security said recently updated projections for the first quarter indicate that revenues will be 8 percent lower than the fourth quarter of last year. That means earnings on a pre-merger basis are likely to be down as much as 27 percent -- 7 cents to 9 cents per share by -- the end of March from the 33 cents per share earned in the last three months of 1999.
The bank cited lower revenues in several of its business lines but most notably in its mortgage banking department. It also blamed lower profit margins due to rising interest rates. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates last month, three times last year and is expected to do so several more times this year if strong national growth is not reined in.
First Security also said its funding mix and revenue momentum have been hampered by the three-month delay in the merger, and it is experiencing more bad loans in its indirect auto and consumer lending, which it attributes to a temporary computer-systems problem that occurred last fall.
That glitch has since been corrected, the bank said, but higher charge-offs are expected to continue through the current quarter, then "normalizing" through the rest of the year.
Despite the bad news, Spencer F. Eccles, chairman and CEO of First Security remained upbeat about the merger, which is now scheduled to close March 22, immediately following votes of shareholders of both Zions and First Security.
"We remain on track with our expectations regarding the long-term benefits that this merger of equals will bring to our respective shareholders and look forward to completing the hard work of integrating these two outstanding franchises," said Eccles in the earnings statement.
"Despite the unexpected delay in closing the merger, we remain on course with our initially projected level of cost savings to be achieved through the combination."
Simmons also said that Zions "remains committed to supporting the merger."
But for the short term, at least, investors clearly don't share their optimism, as witnessed by the major sell-off of shares of both banks. Prior to the Friday conference call, Dale Gibbons, chief financial officer for Zions Bancorp, told the Deseret News that investors are concerned with the implications that the First Security announcement has for the growth prospects of the merged company, which will carry the First Security name.
Unlike First Security, Gibbons said Zions expects its stand-alone first-quarter results to be in line with expectations. "At this time, we don't think we are experiencing the same pressures that led First Security to release this announcement," said Gibbons.
Meanwhile, a federal court hearing on a lawsuit by a coalition of Utahns who want to stop the merger on grounds it would make the new First Security too powerful in the Utah market, is still scheduled for March 10 in Salt Lake City.
The hearing is to be before federal magistrate Judge Richard L. Puglisi of the U.S. District Court of New Mexico in Albuquerque. The court was assigned the case by the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver after all of the federal judges in Utah declined to hear it.
Provo attorney George M. Allen said last month he will ask the judge to not only expedite the summary judgment he is requesting but also, if the judgment is not granted, to hold a trial sometime this month prior to the March 22 planned closure of the merger.
Both banks have declined to discuss the lawsuit, saying it is there policy to not comment on pending litigation. But Gibbons broke the silence Friday when he told the Deseret News that while the suit has been a nuisance, Zions doesn't expect it to stop the merger.
"Substantively, we don't believe it has merit," said Gibbons. "We consider it very doubtful that a federal judge is going to grant an injunction, as requested, considering this merger has already been reviewed and approved by both the (U.S.) Justice Department and the Federal Reserve (Bank Board.)
"We believe the divestiture (of 68 Zions and First Security branches with deposits totaling $2.1 billion) we agreed to ensures that a competitive market for banking services will be proved throughout our territory (in Utah and Idaho where the divestitures will be made.)
