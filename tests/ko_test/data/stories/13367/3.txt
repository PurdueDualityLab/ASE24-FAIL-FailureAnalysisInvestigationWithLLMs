SALT LAKE CITY, March 13 (Reuters) - Zions Bancorp, a Utah bank that announced plans in June to buy local rival First Security Corp. for $5.9 billion in stock, said on Monday its investment banker advised it the deal is no longer fair to its shareholders, raising the specter of the merger falling apart.
Zions' investment banker, Goldman Sachs, told the bank it can no longer rely on its Feb. 17 fairness opinion of the deal, because First Security's business appears to have taken a turn for the worse, Zions said. In a separate statement, First Security disputed Goldman's opinion, and urged Zions to complete the merger under its original terms.
Zions' stock price rose 1-3/16 to 38-7/16 and First Security's fell 9/16 to 11-1/2 in early morning trading. First Security's stock earlier Monday hit a three-year low of 10-3/4.
Zions postponed a shareholders meeting to vote on the deal to March 31, from March 22. The additional time will enable the company to mail shareholders supplemental information on the deal, Zions said.
It was the latest glitch in a proposed merger that has come under pressure since First Security on March 3 announced its first-quarter profits would fall around 25 percent from a year ago due to a slowdown in mortgage banking revenues. Shares of both companies fell sharply on the announcement.
Last summer, Zions agreed to buy First Security by exchanging 0.442 of its shares for each First Security share. At the time, that valued First Security at $28.90 a share, or $5.9 billion for the whole company.
But Zions on Monday said Goldman advised it the share swap exchange ratio is no longer a good deal for its shareholders.
"Goldman Sachs informed Zions that, based on recent developments and changes in information relating to certain of the assumptions underlying its prior fairness opinion, it is no longer able to conclude that the exchange ratio in the merger with First Security is fair ... to the Zions shareholders," Zions said.
First Security disagreed, saying nothing has changed.
"First Security believes there is no basis for the withdrawal of the fairness opinion by Goldman, Sachs, and that there has been no material adverse effect under the terms of the merger agreement," First Security.
First Security's board met on Sunday evening and "urged Zions' board to take steps necessary to cause the merger to be consummated as contemplated by the terms of the merger agreement between the parties," First Security said.
