Problems Plague Zions-First Security Merger

An earnings warning from Salt Lake City's First Security Corp. on Friday left executives at Zions Bancorp. wondering if the banks' $5.9 billion merger deal was cursed.
After all, First Security's disclosure that it would earn 27% less than expected in the first quarter was just the latest in a string of unforeseen events that have plagued the merger since it was announced eight months ago. 'I have never experienced anything like this,' said Dale Gibbons, Zions' chief financial officer. 'Between the Justice Department and the SEC and now, First Security.'
First Security said it expects to earn $0.22 per share in the first quarter, compared to $0.33 per share in the fourth quarter of 1999. It blamed the drop on charge-offs at its mortgage, auto loan and consumer lending divisions, caused in part by a computer glitch.
The earnings warning came just one day after Zions bankers said the deal finally passed muster with two regulatory bodies that had delayed it for months. The banks recently scheduled a shareholder vote on the deal for March 22-four days after the one-year anniversary of when Zions CEO Harris Timmons first met with First Security CEO Spencer Eccles to discuss a deal.
'It's been one bad thing after another in this deal,' said Marc Davis, an analyst at the Banc Stock Group in Columbus, Ohio. 'Do shareholders have a reason to vote against the deal now? I'd say they do.'
Both First Security and Zions pledged to carry the deal forward. The resolve didn't seem to quell Wall Street, which had expected First Security to earn $0.32 per share. First Security closed down 37.9% to $13.96. Shares of Zions were down 24.5% to $38.81.
Tom Burnett, an analyst at Merger Insight in New York, said that the market reaction signaled doubt that the deal could be completed. He also said the transaction remains fundamentally beneficial to both banks. 'You just don't ditch it because of a bad quarter,' he said. 'Both banks' management are committed, but they realize there are a lot angry shareholders.'
Though Gibbons said the deal will go on as planned, there are indications from analysts and bankers that relations between the banks' senior managers is starting to strain. Part of the friction comes from First Security's failure to disclose the problems at the troubled units.
Also, First Security said in a statement the businesses were 'adversely affected' by regulatory delays-including an Securities and Exchange Commission ruling that caused Zions to restate earnings. Calls to the bank were not returned.
Zions was advised by Goldman, Sachs & Co. and represented by Sullivan & Cromwell. First Security was advised by J.P. Morgan & Co. and represented by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.
