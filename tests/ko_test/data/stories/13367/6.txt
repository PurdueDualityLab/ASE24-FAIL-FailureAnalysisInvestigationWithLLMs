First Security Says Zions Reneged on Merger Pact

ln
First Security Corp. on Wednesday accused merger partner Zions Bancorp of breaking the banks' 10-month-old merger agreement.
In a statement mailed to its shareholders, Salt Lake City-based First Security claimed its crosstown rival failed to use 'reasonable best efforts' to consummate the deal and that the Zions board has failed to recommend the deal 'at all times.'
'First Security believes that the Zions board is in breach of its obligations under the merger agreement,' First Security said in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, signed by chairman and CEO Spencer F. Eccles.
The strongly worded statement comes just two days after Zions delayed its shareholder vote on the deal from March 22 to March 31 and said its adviser, Goldman, Sachs & Co., had withdrawn its fairness opinion approving the merger. First Security's shareholders remain scheduled to vote March 22.
Despite the escalating war of words, neither side seems eager to scuttle the deal, opting instead to let their shareholders have their say. Unlike many merger agreements, the Zions-First Security deal does not offer a walk-away price where the deal can be terminated.
First Security 'is poised to complete this merger on which we have diligently worked for over nine months,' it said in its filing. Its adviser, J.P. Morgan & Co. Inc., reaffirmed its fairness opinion on the deal on Feb. 17, the filing said.
Goldman and Zions executives, however, are concerned that the deflated share prices at both banks, but especially at First Security, make the exchange offer a bad value for Zions. But in announcing Goldman's about-face, Zions did not say if it agreed or disagreed with its adviser.
A source familiar with Zions' negotiations with First Security was clearly irritated by the First Security statement. 'They certainly said a lot of things that weren't true . . . but I'm not going to get into a pissing match with a skunk,' the source said.
And, he added, there are no plans for Zions to strike back. 'A lot depends on what their shareholders do and what our shareholders do,' he said. 'We're going to leave it at that.'
Goldman's withdrawal was just one of a number of blows to hit this deal since it was unveiled 10 months ago. The deal was delayed twice in 1999 after the Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Department challenged its accounting and divestiture plan, respectively.
On March 6, First Security disclosed that first-quarter earnings would be 27% lower because of problems in its mortgage business that were caused, in part, by a computer glitch.
Now, analysts see the deal, as structured, as more than tenuous. It's 'on the brink of collapse,' said Kathy Shanley, an analyst with Gimme Credit in Chicago. Shanley said Zions is now paying with its stock price for the delays and bad karma with First Security.
Shares of Zions have dropped 45% since June, closing at $38.75 Wednesday on Nasdaq, up $2.32 for the day. Shares of First Security were down $0.15 to $11.25 Wednesday.
'We cast a cold eye from day one on the integration risks,' Shanley said. 'At the time, we wondered if the merger was a defensive move for Zions. Ironically, Zions now looks more vulnerable than ever.'
