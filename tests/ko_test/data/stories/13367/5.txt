Breaking Up Is Hard for Utah Banks

Last month, when tensions began to rise between Zions Bancorp and its merger partner First Security Corp., Harris Simmons got nervous.
To ease his anxiety, Simmons, Zions' CEO, decided to send an e-mail to his employees, asking them to be careful with proprietary information. What Simmons didn't realize was that much of the systems integration between the banks had been completed, and the e-mail reached not only the First Security rank-and-file but that bank's CEO, Spencer F. Eccles.
'Spence was livid,' said a source familiar with the merger.
As the e-mail glitch shows, as hard as it has been to merge Utah's biggest banks, it may be even harder to tear them apart.
Zions and First Security are joined by more than a carefully crafted $5.9 billion merger pact; they are joined by a business plan, community anticipation and systems integration that has been implemented since the merger was agreed to in July.
But now, a chain of events-many of which could have been foreseen-will probably leave both banks as separate, bitter entities wrangling over what went wrong in the marketplace and in court.
To many close to the deal, the death knell was Zions' March 13 announcement that its adviser, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., had withdrawn its Feb. 17 fairness opinion because a First Security earnings announcement had made the stock exchange ratio a bad deal for Zions shareholders.
Zions shareholders are expected to vote down the merger pact March 31. And that vote will likely trigger a lawsuit by First Security alleging that Zions board of directors and management failed to use its 'best efforts' in seeing the deal through, sources on both sides of the transaction said.
'The earnings announcement is what did this deal in,' said Timothy W. Willi, an analyst with A.G. Edwards in St. Louis. 'To some extent the delays are to blame. Otherwise, this deal would have closed last year and we'd be talking about one company with some earnings problems today.'
Much of the banks' problems begin with the merger agreement itself. Though compelled to merge, Simmons and Eccles were extremely intent to make sure the deal was structured and viewed as a merger-of-equals.
To that end, the June 6 agreement was built without 'walkaways' or 'collars'-provisions that would let either side back out of the deal or renegotiate should valuations of either bank change.
Terms of the deal called for a split of management and ownership. Simmons and the Zions team would run the bank and the Eccles' family would be the dominant shareholder.
The agreement kept egos assuaged but left the merger susceptible to unforeseen events, the first of which happened just weeks later when the Justice Department halted the deal over its divestiture plan.
Though the hold-up didn't derail the merger-the banks agreed Dec. 8 to sell off 68 branches and $2.1 billion in deposits to Hawaii's BancWest Corp.-it did slow the process. Still, the banks were on track to get shareholder approval by Dec. 28.
But two weeks later, the Securities and Exchange Commission halted the deal, asking Zions to restate financial results for the last three years worth of prior acquisitions.
A source close to First Security said that announcement came as a shock to First Security managers and directors. Confident that they would be part of Zions by early 2000, they had not prepared a budget for the next three months. Their shock turned to anger when they learned that Zions had, in fact, been warned by its own auditors, KPMG llp, that an SEC probe was in the offing.
'Even their own auditors were telling them they were flying a little close to the wind,' the source said.
By the time Zions' results were finally restated in February, First Security was having problems of its own: On March 3, the bank said rising charge-offs in its auto and consumer loans and shrinking margins in its mortgage group would result in a 27% drop in earnings for the quarter.
Once again, First Security believes the losses would not have happened had Zions not been forced to restate its earnings. First Security's Crossland mortgage business was supposed to have been integrated into Zions' mortgage bank.
'It's very rare in banking circles, that when a problem like this is announced, it only lasts for one quarter,' said Marc A. Davis, an analyst with The Bank Stock Group in Ohio. 'Interest rates are still going up, and I'm skeptical it's a one-time deal.'
Goldman Sachs, which has been criticized for the advice it gave Mattel in its purchase of the Learning Co., agreed. So it withdrew its fairness opinion and friendly discussion between the two banks shut down.
Though analysts and bankers agree that the deal still makes sense, people close to the situation say they're caught in a Catch-22. Simmons can't support the deal as written and Eccles refuses to let his bank be perceived as the target of Zions.
All of this leaves both banks with the prospect of going solo in a year they expected to be combined. As one person familiar with the deal said, 'They'll have to tear these siamese twins apart.'
'The technical issues will be tough,' said James Wiener, a banking consultant with Oliver & Wyman in New York. 'But the real problem is having to change a whole business strategy-especially when you've shared it with your competitors.'
Wiener said the real problem will be the banks' perceived weakness in the market. Both banks' stocks are down at least 25% since the merger was announced last summer.
Going alone will be tough for both, but harder for First Security which had yielded business planning and strategy to Zions executives. 'The First Security guys are in worse shape,' Wiener said. 'They've also admitted to the world that they need a merger partner and now someone can come along and make a run at them.'
A.G. Edwards' Willi agreed, saying that the business reasons for the merger have been nullified in favor of face-saving and legal maneuvering.
'I'm not worried about Zions,' Willi said. 'But it's tough for First Security. I don't think they have been stellar operators in the first place. Zions was probably doing First Security a favor.'
