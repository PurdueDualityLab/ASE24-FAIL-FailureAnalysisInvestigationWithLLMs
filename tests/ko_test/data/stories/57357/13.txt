Qantas Airwaysplayed down a steering issue that forced an Airbus A-380 to twice abandon departure before taking off from London's Heathrow Airport on Saturday, saying it was unrelated to wing cracks that have led Europe's air safety officials to order global checks on the superjumbo.
Qantasofficials said the plane, due to fly from London to Singapore, was travelling at a very slow speed when the decision was made to return to the bay.
"It was due to thesteering issue. It has no relation to the cracks in the wing ribs at all," Qantas spokeswoman Courtney Treak said.
"Our engineers were able to fix the issue, so we don't have any further concerns."
A spokesman for manufacturer Airbus declined to comment, saying that only the airline could comment on operational matters.
Dr. Faye Smith, businessdevelopment director at the Royal Aeronautical Society, said the A-380 aircraft was on the runway when it twice abandoned takeoff.
"Technical issues withthe nose gear meant the pilot had to abort take off and have us towed off the runway for repairs twice," Smith said by email.
"On both failed occasionswe were on the runway, started to build up speed for takeoff and then suddenly felt deceleration and we stopped on the runway," she added.
The five-hour delay forrepairs meant Heathrow had to lift a curfew banning night flights at the airport, which has tough noise restrictions.
The incident comes several weeks after the discovery of hairline cracks on part of the frame inside A-380 wings.
European safetyauthorities last week extended inspections for similar cracks to the whole fleet according to a detailed timetable. Airbus and operators say there is no risk to safety.
