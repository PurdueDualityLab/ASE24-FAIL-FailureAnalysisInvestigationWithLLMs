United Continental Loss Narrows

United Continental Holdings Inc. reported a smaller fourth-quarter loss on Thursday as merger expenses weighed on the world's largest airline by traffic, and cautioned that costs are set to creep higher as it shrinks its network.
U.S. airlines have led the global industry in cutting capacity to regain pricing power, but they are having to walk a fine line between pushing revenue higher while spreading expenses over a smaller amount of flying.
United expects capacity to be flat to down 1% this year compared with last, though it plans to expand international flying despite the uncertain economic environment.
Its loss narrowed to $138 million, or 42 cents a share, compared with the year-ago loss of $325 million, or $1.01 a share. The year-earlier result included $485 million in special charges, the bulk of them related to integration expenses.
United's revenue grew 5.5%, to $8.9 billion, on a 2.5% decline in capacity compared with a year ago.
Passenger unit revenue, a measure of the amount taken in for each passenger flown a mile, rose 8.2%. United said its unit revenue from its mainline domestic operations, its largest entity, increased by 10%, while its regional flights generated unit revenue growth of 11%. International flights saw less buoyancy although Latin American unit revenues were up nearly 12%.
The Chicago-based company, a product of the merger between United Airlines and Continental Airlines, said advance bookings are higher on domestic flights over the next six weeks, but lower in international markets.
The sharpest fall is for flights to and from Asia, with its booked load seat factor down 7.6 points, while trans-Atlantic services are 2.8 points lower. Bookings are even down for services to Latin America, a source of strength for the broader industry.
The airline would have earned $109 million, or 30 cents a share, in the December quarter but for $247 million of special items it had warned investors about on Jan. 19.
Since closing the merger in October 2010, United has been repainting aircraft, moving its airport check-in and gate facilities together at airports world-wide, aligning employee policies and procedures and preparing for the switch over of United's reservations system to Continental's system in early March.
The two units received a single operating certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration late last year and the company is working to reach joint labor contracts with workers from both subsidiaries so it can begin to mix and match aircraft and crews, a process that will drive the merger synergies it hopes to capture.
The process hasn't been completely smooth--passenger complaints have been rising--and more challenges lie ahead. But Delta Air Lines Inc., which acquired Northwest Airlines in 2008 and became the world's No. 2 by traffic, could serve as a template. After a couple of years focused on digesting the purchase and working through the details of the integration, Delta is now setting its sights on reducing debt, improving its product and expanding its presence in markets including Latin America. Even so, United out-earned Delta for all of 2011, coming in at $1.3 billion excluding one-time items, to Delta's $1.2 billion minus items.
Delta also is studying a potential bid for American Airlines parent AMR Corp., which filed for bankruptcy protection two months ago.
Jeff Smisek, United's chief executive, said 2012 will be the year in which the company will become one airline as far as customers are concerns, with one website, a combined frequent-flier program and a joint computer system that will allow the company match the right aircraft with the right routes and harmonize ancillary product offerings.
Mr. Smisek said he is confident the IT cutover will go well. "We've had four full-scale dress rehearsals," he said. "Literally thousands of people have worked on this." If problems come up--other airlines have been plagued by glitches in combining their IT systems or upgrading them--he said United will be able to revert to the old systems or postpone some aspects of the switchover.
As the airline invests in its products, adds airport staffers and prepares for higher labor pay and benefits once new contracts are reached, "we face cost pressure in 2012," said Zane Rowe, the chief financial officer. On top of that, fuel expenses continue to be a challenge, he said. United intends to keep its capacity flat in the first quarter compared with a year ago. But the revenue outlook continues to be strong, with United estimating its January unit revenue will climb by 11%.
Separately, JetBlue Airways Corp.'s aggressive expansion in Boston helped to nearly triple fourth-quarter profit, though the U.S. carrier will now curb its buildup in the market.
Chief Executive David Barger said he expects the carrier's "growth rate in Boston to slow compared to the last two years." He recently said the airline would expand capacity by about 15% in Boston during 2011.
JetBlue's still plans to increase overall capacity by 5.5% to 7.5% in 2012, making it among the fastest growing in the U. S. industry as peers curb domestic flying to retain pricing power.
On a conference call Thursday with investors to discuss fourth-quarter earnings, Mr. Barger didn't detail 2012 capacity plans for Boston, though said the targeted expansion to 150 daily departures from 100 by the summer of 2015 remain on track.
The slowdown comes as "we harvest the network investments we've made," Mr. Barger said. Lucrative business travelers now make up about 30% of Boston traffic, he said, compared to 20% elsewhere in JetBlue's network. And the budget carrier now does more than a quarter of its flying to the Caribbean and Latin America.
The airline reported a profit of $23 million in the fourth quarter compared with $8 million a year earlier, and per-share earnings rose to eight cents from three cents, double the consensus among analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 22% to a record $1.15 billion.
The Forest Hills, N.Y., company made gains in growth and efficiency in the final quarter as traffic and capacity increased by nearly 11% and it flew slightly fuller planes.
JetBlue's unit revenue, or the amount taken in for each passenger flown a mile, increased 11.8%. The airline expects unit revenue to increase 8% to 9% in January with "similar strength in February," said Mark Powers, JetBlue's chief financial officer. "We expect the robust demand environment to continue through the first quarter."
Excluding fuel, the airline's unit costs, or the amount spent to fly each passenger a mile, decreased 1.5% in the quarter but is expected to increase 2% to 5% in 2012 largely because of scheduled maintenance. To head off costs, Mr. Barger announced a freeze on salaries and hiring in management in 2012.
As of Dec. 31, the company had $1.2 billion in unrestricted cash and short-term investments.
Also Thursday, Alaska Airlines executives expressed disappointment that higher fuel costs outpaced revenue gains in the fourth quarter and said they would fix the problem in 2012 and trim capacity if necessary.
The Seattle-based carrier plans to slow capacity growth to 6% this year after an 8.5% increase in 2011, continuing the expansion of flights to Hawaii, though remains open to cuts to maintain profitability.
"We feel pretty darn good with how revenues performed for most of 2011," said Bradley Tilden, president of Alaska Airlines.
"But right now...these fuel costs are really high and we need to make sure were doing everything we can to recover," he said on a conference call.
Parent Alaska Air Group Inc. reported a profit of $64 million, down from $64.8 million a year earlier. Per-share earnings inched up to $1.76 from $1.75 a year ago.
Stripping out fuel hedging and other items, earnings fell to $1.02 a share from $1.28 a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters predicted per-share earnings of $1.14 on revenue of $1.06 billion. Revenue increased 9% to $1.04 billion
Alaska Air's unit revenue, or the amount taken in for each passenger flown a mile, increased 5.5%, partly driven by some of the fullest planes in the industry at 84.7% in the fourth quarter--1.8 percentage points higher than a year ago.
Excluding fuel, the airline's unit costs, or the amount spent to fly each passenger a mile, decreased 0.1% in the fourth quarter. The airline expects costs to increase by 1% to 1.5% in the first quarter of 2012.
