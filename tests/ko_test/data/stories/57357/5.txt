All six A-380s tested had wing cracks: SIA

FRANKFURT — Singapore Airlines(SIA) has found cracks in the wings of all six of the Airbus A-380s on which it carried out mandatory inspections, but a senior pilot has reassured the public over the superjumbo’s safety.
The discovery of moreinstances of cracked wing components was expected after Airbus said last week it had found the problem and predicted that until it had time to conduct repairs, a consistent pattern would emerge in further tests.
The European plane makerand airlines insist the world’s largest airliner is safe to fly and are keen to move beyond the issue of small cracks in wing brackets that grabbed media attention and triggered compulsory checks last week.
The European AviationSafety Agency (EASA) ordered carriers to inspect almost a third of the global fleet of A-380s, starting with six jets operated by SIA, to check for one of two types of cracks that emerged in the space of weeks.
“We found cracks in allsix. Four we have repaired and they are flying again. The other two will follow in the coming days,” SIA’s public relations manager for Europe, Mr Peter Tomasch, said on Monday at Frankfurt Airport.
EASA ordered the mosturgent checks on aircraft that had carried out at least 1,800 take-offs and landings — the six SIA aircraft fell into this category.
The agency gave airlinessix weeks to perform checks on a second category of jets that had between 1,300 and 1,800 take-offs and landings, and did not order checks on less heavily used aircraft.
Cracks on what Airbusdescribed as a handful of the 2,000 L-shaped brackets fixing exterior panels to the ribcage of each 9,100-sq-ft wing first surfaced during repairs to a Qantas A-380 that was damaged when an engine exploded in November 2010.
Those initial cracks were seen as a minor glitchin the aircraft’s metallic frame, but regulators decided to act when their discovery led engineers to a second and potentially more significant type of crack on the same type of bracket.
Airbus said the crackswere discovered long before they posed a potential safety hazard, but it would have to foot the bill for the checks and repairs. The problems for Airbus and parent EADS could deepen if the response diverts scarce engineering resources or passengers baulk at flying on the US$390 million (S$488 million) jet, analysts said.
In total, 68 super jumbosare in operation out of a total of 253 that have been sold. So far, no airlines operating the A-380 have reported any dip in bookings.
SIA’s chief pilot for theA-380, Captain Robert Ting, flew to Germany on Sunday in one of the six aircraft that had to be fixed as a result of mandatory inspections and he sought to reassure passengers over the aircraft’s safety.
“I slept very well,” he said, referring to his peace of mind during a rest period while a second crew flew the aircraft.
“We have very competentauthorities and a very competent Airbus,” he told reporters in Frankfurt. Captain Ting piloted the world’s first commercial A-380 flight in 2007. Reuters
