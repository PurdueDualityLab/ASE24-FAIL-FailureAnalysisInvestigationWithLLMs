Alaska Air Group, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport Seattle Ice Storm Grounds Flights as 180,000 Left Without Power. An ice storm closed runways at Seattle&Otilde;s main airport and cut power to more than 180,000 people across the Puget Sound region. Alaska Air Group Inc., (ALK) the largest carrier at Seattle- Tacoma International Airport, planned to cancel as much as 70 percent of today&Otilde;s schedule, President Brad Tilden said in a King 5 television interview. Freezing rain on top of near-record snowfall yesterday in parts of the region led to ice accumulations that made travel dangerous, according to the National Weather Service. Washington Governor Christine Gregoire declared a state of emergency, allowing her to activate the National Guard if needed. By 11 a.m., 184,000 customers in counties including King, Thurston and Pierce had lost power, local utility Puget Sound Energy wrote on its Twitter feed. Tree limbs weighed down by ice were breaking and damaging power lines, the utility said. Boeing Co. (BA), whose commercial-airplane operations are centered on Seattle, idled a plant in Frederickson, Washington, while other facilities in the region stayed open. The closed factory makes parts for jets that include the 787 Dreamliner. At least 64 flights have been pulled in Seattle, according to FlightAware.com, a flight-data tracking company based in Houston. Rebooking Fliers Passengers on scrubbed flights will be rebooked later at no charge, Seattle-based Alaska Air said in a message on Twitter. Two of three Seattle-Tacoma runways were open at midday, the airport said in a statement on its website. The University of Washington canceled classes at three sites, including its Seattle campus, while Washington State University in Pullman closed and Seattle public schools were also shut for a second full day, according to their websites. Interstate 90 east of Seattle was closed in some stretches after &Ograve;multiple collisions,&Oacute; according to the Washington State Department of Transportation. Fallen trees blocked other roads. Bus and train service was limited. &Ograve;This is purely a precautionary measure,&Oacute; Gregoire said in a statement accompanying the emergency declaration. &Ograve;So far, we haven&Otilde;t received any requests for state assistance -- but we know weather conditions are rapidly changing.&Oacute; Jan 20, 2012
Alaska Airlines, Horizon Air Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air Operating Limited Schedules in Seattle. Freezing rain and snow continue to affect Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air operations, which forced the carriers to cancel 310 flights to and from Seattle by early evening, affecting 29,000 passengers. Only 15 of Alaska's 114 daily flights and one Horizon flight had departed Seattle by that time as the region was hit by an extraordinary ice storm. 'We are doing our best to operate as many flights as possible to get people where they need to go as we cope with severe ice accumulation on our planes,' Alaska Airlines' President Brad Tilden said. 'We appreciate customers' patience and understanding as we contend with the freezing rain that has disrupted travel throughout the region. Our operational decisions will continue to be guided by our commitment to safety.' Tilden advised customers to check the status of their flights online at www.alaskaair.com and not drive to the airport unless their flight is scheduled to operate. Both airlines are working to re-accommodate passengers whose flights have been disrupted. Passengers booked on canceled flights to or from Seattle between Jan. 17 and Jan. 20 may request a refund of the unused portion of their ticket at www.alaskaair.com through Jan. 25. Customers who need to reschedule their travel should call Alaska Airlines Reservations at 1-800-ALASKAAIR (1-800-252-7522 or TTY/TDD line 1-800-392-0228). The airline is waiving change fees. Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air will attempt to operate 20 departures from Seattle each for the rest of the day, if weather conditions permit. Weather reports forecast freezing rain until midnight with rain expected tomorrow. If that holds true, the carriers expect to return to mostly normal operations on Friday, however, the forecasts have been changing frequently. By the numbers: Due to the unusual icing conditions, it is taking one hour to deice one aircraft &Ntilde; four times longer than normal &Ntilde; and requires quadruple the amount of deicing fluid. Sixteen deicing trucks are being used to fight snow and ice. The trucks use forced air in conjunction with de-icing fluid, making them more efficient while using less fluid. Since 2008, the airline has increased its holding capacity of de-icing fluid at Sea-Tac by 70 percent. Fifty phones and computer stations have been set up in the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport terminal to enable additional agents to rebook customers faster. More than 345 Alaska Airlines' reservations agents are working to assist customers &Ntilde; a 35 percent increase in staffing. As many as 750 calls made to Alaska's reservations center were on hold at one time. As many as 120 employees have been staying in hotels near Sea-Tac Airport the past two nights to ensure they could make it to work. More than 30 employees from Alaska Airlines' Corporate Headquarters are volunteering at the airport today to assist customers. Due to the ongoing possibility of adverse weather and as a precaution, the airlines are not allowing unaccompanied minors or checked pets to travel at this time. Jan 19, 2012

American Safari Cruises American Safari Cruises to resume port calls to Molokai. Following progress made on Moloka'i about the future of Kaunakakai Harbor, the state of Hawai'i and the US Coast Guard will hold a community meeting to present the security plan for the resumption of port calls by American Safari Cruises. It will be held from 4:30 to 6:30 pm on Tuesday, January 17, at Mitchell Pau'ole Community Center in Kaunakakaki. American Safari Cruises will resume its port call into Kaunakakai Harbor on Saturday, January 21, 2012. The company cancelled its port calls last month in response to community concerns. Since then, Moloka'i residents and officials have held meetings to discuss the future of tour operations in Kaunakakai. Department of Land and Natural Resources Chairman William ila has been actively participating in those discussions on behalf of the state. 'I am pleased that we have settled the situation with American Safari Cruises, which could not have been achieved without the coming together of all the concerned parties,' said Chair ila, 'This meeting is the next step in keeping an open dialogue with the community.' &Ograve;The people of Moloka'i have shown leadership in seeking a resolution to concerns that were raised about tour operations, and we want to thank them for working with the state in an open dialogue,&Oacute; said Chair ila, &Ograve;This meeting will allow us the opportunity to provide information regarding the resumption of port calls by American Safari Cruises to Moloka'i.&Oacute; Chair ila will be joined by officials from the state Department of Transportation, the Maui County Police, and the US Coast Guard who oversee and ensure environmental, public, and navigational safety in the harbor. &Ograve;I am thankful that Chairman ila, the community, and American Safari Cruises have been able to reach a peaceful resolution to this matter,&Oacute; said Maui Mayor Alan Arakawa. The US Coast Guard will also be seeking public comment on a temporary security zone that has been established for the waters of Kaunakakai Harbor. Specific details on the security zone, including instructions on submitting comments, can be reviewed at http://www.gpo.gov.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-01-13/pdf/2012-549.pdf . The security zone will be enforced one hour prior to Kaunakakai Harbor entries and departures by the passenger vessel SAFARI EXPLORER. Notice of the zone&Otilde;s activation will be provided by broadcast notices to mariners and the display of a red flag at the Kaunakakai Harbor Master&Otilde;s building. Captain Joanna Nunan, Commander Coast Guard Sector Honolulu, said, &Ograve;Public safety in Moloka'i remains our top priority, and we are committed to maintaining an open dialogue with community stakeholders on how we can best serve our shared interests.&Oacute; Jan 16, 2012

British Airways British Airways' false alarm causes panic in cabin. British Airways is apologizing to passengers of a trans-Atlantic flight after a recorded message announcing the plane was about to make an emergency landing in the ocean was mistakenly played over the intercom. The incident, which happened on a flight from Miami to London late Friday, caused panic in the cabin. Passengers told British newspapers that about three hours into the journey, a recorded voice suddenly announced: 'This is an emergency, we will shortly be making an emergency landing on water.' In fact, the flight was proceeding normally, but the frightening message led passengers to assume the worst. 'We looked at each other and figured we were both about to die. Families with children were distraught and people were in tears. It was very distressing,' passenger Duncan Farquharson told The Telegraph. 'About 30 seconds later, one of the cabin crew told us to ignore the announcement. ... Imagining yourself plunging towards a cold, watery grave in the middle of the Atlantic is a pretty horrific thought, but they seemed very blas[#x17d] about it.' British Airways isn't saying whether a technical glitch or human error caused the recording to play. 'The cabin crew canceled the announcement immediately and reassured customers that the flight was operating normally,' the airline said in a statement. 'We apologized to customers for causing them undue concern.' The plane landed safely at its destination. Jan 18, 2012
Carnival Cruise Line Concordia at &Ocirc;High Risk&Otilde; of Sinking as Italy Issues Storm Warning for Area. The Costa Concordia cruise ship that ran aground on Italy&Otilde;s Giglio island is at &Ograve;high risk&Oacute; of sinking, threatening Europe&Otilde;s biggest marine park as a storm heads toward the area. &Ograve;It very much depends on the change in weather conditions,&Oacute; Environment Minister Corrado Clini said yesterday in Parliament in Rome. The government plans to declare a state of emergency for the area at a Cabinet meeting today, as well as approve a measure that would restrict cruise ships from access to sensitive coastal regions. Italy&Otilde;s Civil Protection Agency yesterday issued a weather warning for possible storms on the western coast of Italy, including Giglio, according to a statement on its website. Clini said there is a risk that the 290-meter (951 feet) long ship, which is lying in an unsteady position, will slip off an underwater ledge and sink into a 70-meter-deep trough, threatening to rupture fuel tanks. Efforts to find more than 20 missing passengers and crew of Carnival Corp.&Otilde;s (CCL) Concordia cruise ship resumed yesterday as two of the confirmed 11 deaths were identified as French passengers. Carnival&Otilde;s Italian unit, Costa Crociere SpA, has hired Smit Salvage, a unit of Royal Boskalis Westminster NV, to remove 500,000 gallons of fuel from the crippled cruise liner. The company will need two to four weeks to take the fuel off the ship, executives said on a conference call Jan. 17. Fuel-removal operations haven&Otilde;t started because the company wants to do a complete underwater inspection first and is waiting for approval from Italian authorities to proceed, said Martin Schuttevaer, director of investor relations for Royal Boskalis. Marine Sanctuary The ship is lying on its side off Giglio, an island of 1,500 inhabitants in winter who survive on fishing and tourism, located about 14 miles from the Tuscan coast. Giglio lies within the Santuario dei Cetacei, an area of roughly 87,500 square kilometers that in 1999 was declared by the governments of France, Italy and Monaco as a sanctuary for marine mammals such as dolphins and whales. So far, there&Otilde;s only been a small oil leak from a damaged lifeboat, Corrado Passera, Italy&Otilde;s economic development and infrastructure minister, said at the Senate in Rome yesterday. The search team returned to the area at 6 a.m. local time yesterday after the rescue operation was temporarily halted when ship movements were detected. Rescue divers discovered five bodies on Jan. 17. Coastal Reef The vessel struck a reef near Giglio on Jan. 13 after the captain deviated from the planned route to sail close to the island, hours after the vessel left a port near Rome with 4,200 passengers and crew for a Mediterranean cruise. The captain, Francesco Schettino, was placed under house arrest on Jan. 17 for allegedly causing the shipwreck and abandoning the ship, court documents show. Costa Crociere has suspended the captain, Marco De Luca, a lawyer for the company, said in an interview on SkyTG24 television. Schettino didn&Otilde;t abandon the ship, his lawyer Bruno Leporatti has said, and his actions saved many lives, according to a Jan. 16 statement from the attorney. The captain said he didn&Otilde;t leave the Concordia intentionally, according to the court documents. Schettino failed to promptly inform the Coast Guard after he struck the rocks that ripped a hole in the ship&Otilde;s hull and is accused by prosecutors of abandoning the vessel with about 300 people still aboard, Judge Valeria Montesarchio said in her Jan. 16 decision to place him under house arrest. Schettino was repeatedly ordered by a senior Coast Guard official to return to the ship. The captain said there was no way to get back onboard, according to a recording of the conversations, which has been verified by the Coast Guard. &Ocirc;Blackout Problem&Otilde; Recorded conversations between Schettino and Coast Guard officials broadcast by SkyTG24 showed the captain initially played down the accident, insisting 30 minutes after the Concordia hit rocks, and started taking in water, that it was only a &Ograve;blackout problem.&Oacute; Judge Montesarchio rejected a prosecutor request for the captain to remain in jail, saying that while the commander had hesitated in giving the evacuation order, he was not a flight risk. Prosecutors plan to appeal the judge&Otilde;s decision to grant house arrest. Schettino gave the evacuation order more than an hour after the ship hit the rocks, delaying rescue operations, according to the court document. The captain said he made an emergency maneuver after hitting the rocks to prevent the ship from heading out to sea and sinking, according to the judge&Otilde;s written decision. Carnival, the world&Otilde;s largest cruise operator, said in a statement yesterday that it has begun refunding passengers and that it&Otilde;s arranging lodging, transportation and counseling for passengers and crew.

Carnival Cruise Line Unhindered expansion may have led to Costa Concordia tragedy. The tragedy of the Costa Concordia last weekend may have stemmed from the cruise industry's drive to churn out more new ships as fast as possible, which, although not lacking in a parallel drive to improve ship safety technology, has outpaced proper training of personnel in the face of a crisis, Edward Hadas writes. 'Once the expensive ships are built, it is punitively expensive not to put them out to sea filled with paying passengers, even if the quality of the staff leaves something to be desired. So unless something is done to alleviate the competitive pressure to run full speed ahead, the people will almost inevitably be the weakest link in the enterprise,' he writes. Jan 19, 2012
Carnival Cruise Line Carnival Corp. Launches Safety Audit, Emergency Response Review. Following the tragic Costa Concordia accident, Carnival Corp. & plc, parent company of Costa Cruises and nine other cruise lines, announced a comprehensive audit and review of all safety and emergency response procedures across all of the company&Otilde;s cruise lines. Carnival Corp. and the cruise industry as a whole have maintained an excellent safety record over the years. &Ograve;However, this tragedy has called into question our company&Otilde;s safety and emergency response procedures and practices,&Oacute; said Micky Arison, chairman and CEO of Carnival Corp. & plc. &Ograve;While I have every confidence in the safety of our vessels and the professionalism of our crews, this review will evaluate all practices and procedures to make sure that this kind of accident doesn&Otilde;t happen again.&Oacute; The review is being led by Capt. James Hunn, a retired U.S. Navy captain and currently the company&Otilde;s senior vice president of maritime policy and compliance. Following a 32-year career in the Navy, Hunn has held senior positions at Carnival Corp. for nearly a decade, focusing on corporate-wide efforts to establish maritime policy standards, while overseeing the company&Otilde;s health, environmental, safety and security practices. Hunn and senior health and safety executives from each of the lines will review all safety and emergency response policies and procedures, officer and crew training and evaluation, bridge management and company-wide response and support efforts. Hunn will report to the Health, Environment, Safety & Security Committee of the Board, and to Howard Frank, vice chairman and COO of Carnival Corp. & plc. In addition, the Health, Environment, Safety & Security Committee is engaging outside industry-leading experts in the fields of emergency response organization, training and implementation to conduct an audit of all of the company&Otilde;s emergency response and safety procedures and to conduct a thorough review of the Costa Concordia accident.

Carnival Cruise Line Carnival, Costa Pledge Commitment to Concordia Passengers, Crew. Costa Cruises and its parent company, Carnival Corp. & plc, issued a statement late Jan. 18 confirming their commitment to &Ograve;provide full support to those passengers, crew and families of the victims of the Costa Concordia grounding.&Oacute; &Ograve;I give my personal assurance that we will take care of each and every one of our guests, crew and their families affected by this tragic event,&Oacute; said Carnival Chairman and CEO Micky Arison. &Ograve;Our company was founded on this principle and it will remain our focus.&Oacute; Costa has been arranging lodging and transportation for affected passengers and crew members to return home. The companies said &Ograve;every passenger and crew member or their family is being contacted and the company has offered its assistance and counseling as needed, and will be addressing personal possessions lost on board.&Oacute; Costa said it has begun the process of refunding all voyage costs, including passenger cruise fares and all costs incurred while on board. Senior management teams are working together to determine additional support. &Ograve;During this time of tragedy, we are doing our very best to provide the needed support to the Costa Concordia passengers, crew and their families,&Oacute; said Pier Luigi Foschi, chairman and CEO of Costa Cruises.

Carnival Cruise Line Concordia Sinking Spurs Congressional Hearing on Safety at Sea. U.S. Rep. John L. Mica, a Republican from Florida, announced that the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee will conduct a hearing to review cruise ship safety in light of the Costa Concordia sinking. &Ograve;The Costa Concordia tragedy is a wake-up call for the United States and international maritime organizations to carefully review and make certain we have in place all appropriate standards to ensure passengers&Otilde; safety on cruise ships,&Oacute; said Mica, chairman of the committee. &Ograve;In general, cruise travel is a safe form of transportation and an important jobs provider for the nation&Otilde;s economy. Congress must closely examine how this incident occurred and address questions raised regarding vessel safety and operating standards and crew training requirements. The committee will review the events of this specific incident, current safety measures and training requirements set by law and international maritime transportation agreements to ensure this mode of transportation remains as safe as possible.&Oacute; Mica said he has asked Rep. Frank LoBiondo (R-N.J.), who chairs the subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, to help lead the review and preliminary investigations in preparation for a hearing in February. &Ograve;Although it is early in the investigatory process, it appears the Costa Concordia was a preventable tragedy,&Oacute; LoBiondo said. &Ograve;The committee and subcommittee will use this hearing to review current U.S. laws and regulations in an effort to ensure a similar tragedy does not occur aboard vessels calling on American ports.&Oacute; On Wednesday, the first victim was publicly identified as Sandor Feher, a 38-year-old violinist from Hungary who was working as an entertainer on the ship. Five bodies recovered shortly after the sinking were identified, but their names not released. The second five bodies have not been identified. Twenty-one people remain unaccounted for. Costa Cruises also announced that plans to remove 2,300 tons of fuel from the stricken ship could be implemented by week&Otilde;s end. The line issued a statement confirming that it has hired worldwide salvage experts SMIT Salvage, of Rotterdam, The Netherlands, in the hours immediately after the accident to draw up a plan. The plan has been shared with the relevant authorities. Jan 18, 2012
Carnival Cruise Line Carnival Ship Captain Under House Arrest as Death Toll Rises. The captain of a Carnival Corp. (CCL) ship that ran aground off Italy was placed under house arrest hours after audio emerged of a Coast Guard official ordering him to return to his damaged ship and oversee rescue efforts. Captain Francesco Schettino, who may face criminal charges including manslaughter, was put under house arrest late yesterday by a judge in Grosseto, Italy, his lawyer, Bruno Leporatti, told reporters in remarks broadcast on Sky TG24 television. The ruling came hours after divers discovered five more bodies on the stricken ship, bringing the death toll to 11. Twenty-eight people are missing, according to Italy&Otilde;s Civil Protection agency. Judge Valeria Montesarchio took three hours of testimony from Schettino as TV news programs and websites broadcast audio of phone conversations on Jan. 13 between Schettino and a senior Coast Guard official after the Costa Concordia struck rocks off the island of Giglio and tilted on its side with 4,200 people on board. Coast Guard Commander Gregorio Maria De Falco repeatedly ordered Schettino to get back on the cruise liner, at times swearing at the captain. Schettino initially told the official that only 40 people remained on the ship at a time when hundreds were still trying to evacuate. The ship began listing, complicating efforts to lower lifeboats and forcing passengers to move across the exposed hull to reach rescue boats. Rope Ladders &Ograve;There are people climbing down a rope ladder on the bow of the ship, take a lifeboat and climb up that ladder and climb up on to the ship and tell me how many people are there,&Oacute; De Falco, speaking from the city of Livorno on the Italian mainland, told Schettino, according to audio posted yesterday on the website of newspaper Corriere della Sera. &Ograve;Tell me if there are women, children and people in need.&Oacute; When the captain hesitated to reply, De Falco said there were fatalities and again ordered him to return. &Ograve;You realize it&Otilde;s dark and we can&Otilde;t see anything?&Oacute; Schettino said, adding that &Ograve;other rescue workers&Oacute; were now in place. &Ograve;You&Otilde;ve been telling me that for an hour, now get back on board!&Oacute; the Coast Guard official shouted. A Coast Guard spokesman confirmed that the audio is authentic. Flight Risk Schettino didn&Otilde;t return and took a taxi on Giglio before being arrested, media including Sky TG24 reported. Prosecutor Francesco Verusio had requested that Schettino be held in jail because of the risk he might flee, rather than be permitted to return to his home in Sorrento, Italy. Schettino told the judge he made a navigational error that led to the accident, daily la Repubblica reported today, citing testimony. Schettino said he knew the waters in the area but ordered the ship to turn too late, according to the Italian newspaper. He said he brought the ship close to Giglio as a salute to a colleague, with whom he was speaking on the phone at the time, Repubblica reported. Leporatti wasn&Otilde;t immediately available for comment today on the Repubblica report and didn&Otilde;t respond to an e-mail seeking confirmation. He will hold a press conference today in Grosseto, according to his office. Schettino is &Ograve;shattered, dismayed, saddened for the loss of lives and strongly disturbed,&Oacute; Leporatti said in a statement Jan. 16. Rescue divers discovered five more bodies yesterday after setting off small explosives to allow them to reach more remote parts of the ship. Authorities yesterday for the first time released a list of those still unaccounted for. Carnival shares fell 14 percent in New York yesterday to USD29.60, the biggest decline since the first day of trading after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. &Ocirc;Deeply Saddened&Otilde; Carnival Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Micky Arison, said he was &Ograve;deeply saddened&Oacute; by the news of the additional deaths. &Ograve;Our immediate priority continues to be supporting rescue and recovery efforts and looking after our guests and crew members, along with securing the vessel to ensure there is no environmental impact,&Oacute; Arison said in an e-mailed statement late yesterday. &Ograve;My senior management team and I have been in continuous contact with the Costa executive team in Italy and we have our senior-level technical experts on the ground to provide additional support for this tragic and highly unusual incident.&Oacute; First Accident Schettino, who joined the company in 2002, was promoted to captain in 2006 and never had a prior accident, according to Pier Luigi Foschi, chairman of Carnival&Otilde;s Italian unit, Costa Crociere SpA. The Costa Concordia ran aground about 9:45 p.m. on Jan. 13 within hours of leaving a port near Rome to continue a Mediterranean cruise. The ship&Otilde;s route was set electronically before it left, and the cruise liner shouldn&Otilde;t have been so close to Giglio, Foschi said at a press conference in Genoa on Jan. 16. &Ograve;The fact that the ship strayed from that course can only be due to a maneuver that was not approved, not authorized nor communicated to Costa Crociere by the captain of the ship,&Oacute; Foschi said. Foschi visited the island yesterday and said the accident didn&Otilde;t reflect any safety issues with Costa ships. &Ograve;Our ships are safe just as they were on Friday,&Oacute; he said from Giglio, where the Concordia juts out of the water just off the edge of the island. &Ograve;It has nothing to do with security at sea nor does it have anything to do with our policy, training or the quality of our personnel.&Oacute; Electrical Problem Passengers were initially told after the collision that the ship had an electrical problem and there was nothing to be concerned about. The order to abandon ship wasn&Otilde;t given for more than an hour after the accident, when the ship was beginning to list, making it impossible to lower many of the lifeboats, passengers on the cruise liner said. Video released Jan. 16 of the rescue operation showed hundreds of passengers clamoring along the side of the ship to reach ladders that led down to water, where they were loaded onto rescue boats. Giglio, an island of 1,500 inhabitants in winter who survive on fishing and tourism, is located about 14 miles from the Tuscan coast. Giglio lies within the &Ograve;Santuario dei Cetacei,&Oacute; an area of roughly 33,784 square kilometers that in 1999 was declared by the governments of France, Italy and Monaco a sanctuary for marine mammals such as dolphins and whales. Salvage Operation Smit Salvage, a unit of Royal Boskalis Westminster NV, contracted by Costa Crociere to remove the ship&Otilde;s 2,400 tons of oil, is ready to begin inspecting the vessel as soon as today. The company will need two to four weeks to take the fuel off the ship, executives said on a conference call yesterday. &Ograve;The vessel is stable and we feel confident that removal can be done in a fairly rapid way,&Oacute; Kees van Essen, Smit&Otilde;s manager of operations, said during the call. There have been no leaks so far and salvage operations don&Otilde;t increase the chance of leaks, he said. Weather conditions in the area, which have been calm since the accident, are forecast to deteriorate beginning tomorrow. Italian Environment Minister Corrado Clini said yesterday that the pumping of the fuel won&Otilde;t begin until the search-and- rescue operation is completed. Clini, who said this week he was concerned about the threat of an environmental disaster, will speak in parliament today at 4 p.m. about the salvage operation. Jan 18, 2012
Carnival Cruise Line Costa CEO Says Concordia Captain Deviated from Approved Route. The master of the Costa Concordia changed course to sail close to the Italian island of Giglio, apparently a practice of some ship captains to greet the residents. &Ograve;He wanted to show the ship to this island so he decided to change the course of the ship to go closer to the island and pass in front of the little city,&Oacute; Costa Chairman and CEO Pier Luigi Foschi said in a press conference Jan. 16. &Ograve;The captain did not follow the authorized route used by Costa ships very frequently.&Oacute; The 114,000-ton ship was about 500 feet from the island when it hit rocks that ripped a 160-foot gash in the hull. The ship took on water and began listing, forcing the evacuation of about 4,200 passengers and crew. The captain, Francesco Schettino, who was on the bridge at the time of the incident, is being detained by Italian authorities on suspicion of manslaughter and abandoning ship. On the morning of Jan. 16, about 16 people remained unaccounted for, including a couple from Minnesota. The death toll rose to six with the discovery of a body of an adult male passenger on the ship, according to local news reports. Rescue operations, which require divers to carefully search the ship, were suspended when the seas became rough and the vessel started to move. Foschi answered questions from reporters in a conference call for almost 90 minutes, sometimes demurring on specifics since the Italian authorities took the black box that tracks the ship&Otilde;s movements for their own investigation. Costa also does not have access to the ship. He said lifeboat drills are required to be held within 24 hours of boarding, which means the 696 passengers that boarded in Civitavecchia did not undergo the drill before the incident, which occurred 3.5 hours after departure. Costa Concordia and other ships in the fleet commonly board passengers in several ports along the way. Foschi said a video of evacuation procedures shows in stateroom TVs and there are large signs that direct passengers to muster stations. He said the 4,200 passengers and crew members were evacuated within two hours, although the process was hindered when the ship began to list, making it difficult to lower lifeboats. When asked if any other officers tried to stop the captain from changing course, Foschi said &Ograve;the captain is the authority by law&Oacute; and can make decisions based on weather, sea conditions or other factors. &Ograve;In this particular case, the captain decided to change the route and went into water he did not know,&Oacute; he said. In response to a question, he said, &Ograve;from what I know, the captain does not drink alcohol. The captain and officers are subject to regular tests for alcohol and drugs.&Oacute; Foschi also said the company is concerned about environmental impact, since the ship is carrying about 2,300 tons of fuel. &Ograve;So far there is no impact but we are still very, very concerned,&Oacute; he said. &Ograve;We will ensure there will be no environmental impact.&Oacute; A Danish company has been hired to remove the fuel. Meanwhile, parent company Carnival Corp. & plc said a damage assessment of the vessel is currently being undertaken to determine how long it will be out of service. It is expected to be out of service for the remainder of our current fiscal year, if not longer. For the fiscal year ending Nov. 30, the impact to 2012 earnings for loss of use is expected to be approximately USD85 million to USD95 million or 11-12 cents per share. The company has insurance coverage for damage to the vessel with a deductible of approximately USD30 million as well as insurance for third-party personal injury liability subject to an additional deductible of approximately USD10 million for this incident. The company self-insures for loss of use of the vessel. &Ograve;At this time, our priority is the safety of our passengers and crew,&Oacute; said Carnival Chairman and CEO Micky Arison. &Ograve;We are deeply saddened by this tragic event, and our hearts go out to everyone affected by the grounding of the Costa Concordia and especially to the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives. They will remain in our thoughts and prayers.&Oacute; Jan 16, 2012
Cessna Aircraft Engine failure forces Cessna to land in Kansas field. The pilot of a Cessna had no choice but to set his small plane down in a weedy field after engine failure forced him to land before he could reach Forbes Field near Topeka, Kan. This report says the pilot escaped serious injury even though his plane smashed through a barbed-wire fence and sustained a fuel leak. Records from the Federal Aviation Administration show that the plane belongs to Eagle Sky Patrol of Nemo, S.D. Jan 18, 2012
Chicago's O'Hare Airport Winter Storm Dumps Snow On US Midwest. A winter storm dumping snow across the US Midwest on Friday forced the cancellation of more than 600 flights at Chicago's O'Hare Airport, while slick roads and poor visibility snarled traffic across the region. The storm was expected to drop 1 to 8 inches of snow from the Dakotas to the lower Great Lakes, with Chicago among the hardest hit among the big cities. Up to 7 inches of snow was expected in Chicago, where Southwest Airlines also cancelled all of its flights from 2 pm to 5 pm at Midway Airport and delayed flights scheduled for 5 pm to 7 pm, according to the Chicago aviation department. Milwaukee and Cleveland both were expected to be hit with up to 5 inches of snow. Several smaller school districts outside of Milwaukee have cancelled after-school programmes. The storm dropped about an inch of snow on Friday morning in the Twin Cities area, where there were reports of hundreds of minor accidents on slick roads and long morning rush hour delays. Snow fall totals were heavier south of the Twin Cities. Reports of 4 to 6 inches were common from far southern Minnesota, across northeast Iowa and southwest Wisconsin, the National Weather Service said. The snow is expected to push into the northeast, with up to six inches of the white stuff expected from Pennsylvania through central Maine Saturday, and up to four inches in New York City. In Washington state, which has seen unusually heavy snow, two climbers and two campers are missing in Mount Rainier National Park. Searches were suspended on Friday afternoon because of the weather, which includes 40 mph winds, poor visibility, and thick fog. The Puget Sound region continued to see scattered power outages on Friday, affecting about 275,000 customers. Seattle is preparing for possible flooding, with crews clearing storm drains of snow and debris. Jan 20, 2012

Ford Technology can reduce distractions for drivers, Ford CEO says. While the National Transportation Safety Board is advocating a national ban on drivers' use of mobile phones, Ford Motor is asserting that adding more technology to vehicles doesn't necessarily mean more distraction for the driver. 'This [technology] is the way the world is going ... people aren't going to be disconnected in a connected world,' said Alan Mulally, president and CEO of Ford, adding that the company was working to address the issue with technology that 'absolutely will remove driver distraction.'

Kansas City International Airport Man who tried to pass through security with fake bomb unfit for trial. A federal court last week found a Pennsylvania man accused of trying to take a fake bomb through a security checkpoint at Kansas City International Airport unfit to stand trial. Anthony Falco Jr., 47, allegedly attempted to pass through security with the bomb on the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks. He will be hospitalized for up to four months to determine if he will ever be fit for trial. Jan 16, 2012
Lloyd, Carnival Lloyd&Otilde;s List Tracking Data Shows Ship Sailed Similar Path Last Year . Lloyd&Otilde;s List, the British maritime publication, said its vessel tracking data shows that the Costa Concordia sailed within 230 meters (about 250 yards) of the coast of Giglio Island on a previous voyage, even closer to shore than where it hit rocks Jan. 13. In a press release, Lloyd&Otilde;s List says the new evidence indicates the disaster &Ograve;may not be a black-and-white case of shipmaster error.&Oacute; The cruise ship had previously changed course to get closer to Giglio on the night of Aug. 14, owners Costa Cruises have said. The company&Otilde;s CEO, Pier Luigi Foschi, stressed the decision was taken under the authorization of the local maritime authority and the permission of Costa after the route was reviewed. However, Costa described the Jan. 13 routing as a deviation that was &Ograve;unauthorized, unapproved and unknown to Costa.&Oacute; However, tracking data obtained by Lloyd&Otilde;s List Intelligence proprietary land-based AIS receivers shows that the approved and unapproved routes were just meters apart and that the previously approved route took the vessel closer to shore than the unapproved route. &Ograve;Our data suggests that both routes took the vessel within 200 meters (about 218 yards) of the impact point and that the authorized route was actually closer to shore,&Oacute; said Richard Meade, editor of Lloyd&Otilde;s List. &Ograve;This is not a black-and-white case.&Oacute; Meanwhile, the Associated Press said the death toll stands at 11 with 24 missing, including a retired couple from Minnesota and 13 Germans, six Italians, four French, two Americans and one person each from Hungary, India and Peru. Search-and-rescue operations halted early Wednesday when it appeared the ship shifted again. Some fear the ship could slide off the rocks into deeper waters, with some even expressing caution that it could crack in half. Work is also under way on how to salvage the vessel and prevent its 2,300 tons of fuel from polluting the water. The tragedy spurred a cruise industry critic to call for greater regulation. California Congresswoman Doris Matsui was a sponsor of the Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act, which called for more onboard security and became law in July 2010. &Ograve;The Costa Concordia tragedy underlines the critical need for greater regulation of the cruise line industry,&Oacute; she said in a statement. &Ograve;The Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act of 2010 made great strides in putting forth both physical and reporting requirements to protect cruise ship passengers from danger, and ensure that crimes are reported in a timely manner. &Ograve;While this was a major step forward in oversight of the highly unregulated cruise line industry, the incident in Italy shows that still more must be done to protect passengers. I will continue working with my colleagues to see that there is greater regulation of, and accountability for, the cruise industry, so that a tragedy like this does not occur again.&Oacute; Jan 18, 2012
Lockheed Martin Lockheed will install fix for F-35 fuel dump system. Lockheed Martin says it has found a way to fix the F-35's fuel dump system that was flagged as a fire hazard and expects to have the modification installed on the test plane 'early this year.' The problem stemmed from the design of the fuel dump valve that did not push all of the fuel far enough away from the surfaces of the aircraft. Jan 19, 2012
Lockheed Martin, U.S. Navy F-35C carrier landing failure is called due to tail hook design. Lockheed Martin says it has determined that the U.S. Navy F-35C's tail hook design is to blame for the fighter jet's problems in landing on carriers. The arresting wires on the carrier are failing to properly catch the tail hook. 'The good news is that it's fairly straightforward and isolated to the hook itself. It doesn't have secondary effects going into the rest of the airplane,' said Lockheed F-35 program manager Tom Burbage. Jan 18, 2012
Toyota Motor Auto Electronic Faults May Be Untraceable, Need More Oversight, Panel Say. U.S. regulators were justified in closing a probe into unintended acceleration of Toyota Motor Corp. vehicles without finding electronic causes, a National Academy of Sciences panel said while emphasizing it wasn&Otilde;t ruling out such failures in the future. Software and other electronic failures may not leave traces that investigators are equipped to find, so the Washington-based National Highway Traffic Safety Administration must &Ograve;become more familiar with and engaged in&Oacute; setting automotive- electronics standards, the panel said today in a report. &Ograve;It&Otilde;s impossible to prove a complete negative, but all the data available to us indicated the conclusion that there was no electronic or software problem&Oacute; that may have caused the Toyota unintended acceleration reports, Louis Lanzerotti, a New Jersey Institute of Technology physics professor and chairman of the panel, said today on a conference call with reporters. Toyota recalled more than 8 million Toyota and Lexus vehicles worldwide in 2009 and 2010, a record, after reports of unintended acceleration. NHTSA and Toyota investigated the electronic throttle controls, which send signals from the accelerator to the engine. They blamed the incidents on sticky gas pedals or floor mats that might jam them. The committee often discussed the potential for &Ograve;untraceable faults&Oacute; as an explanation for unintended acceleration, the panel said in the report. Working With Regulators &Ograve;We share the goal of NAS and NHTSA to make America&Otilde;s vehicles even safer, and we will continue to work collaboratively and constructively with regulators and lawmakers to help achieve the greatest possible benefits from the academy&Otilde;s valuable work,&Oacute; Toyota said in a statement posted to its website today. The 16-member scientific panel was convened following congressional hearings in 2010 examining Toyota&Otilde;s recalls and of the regulator&Otilde;s response to those defects. Automotive safety advocates including Sean Kane, president of Safety Research & Strategies Inc., and Joan Claybrook, a former NHTSA administrator and former president of the advocacy group Public Citizen, have said the fact that NHTSA didn&Otilde;t find an electronic cause for the Toyota reports didn&Otilde;t exonerate the automaker because there was no way to record what may have happened. Today&Otilde;s report doesn&Otilde;t exclude an electronic cause for unintended acceleration, Kane said in a phone interview. &Ocirc;Contradictory&Otilde; Report &Ograve;The report is contradictory,&Oacute; he said. &Ograve;On one hand, they call the agency out for being unequipped for being unable to handle electronics. On the other hand, they say they&Otilde;re not going to second-guess NHTSA&Otilde;s conclusions.&Oacute; Clients of Safety Research & Strategies, a Rehoboth, Massachusetts-based advocacy and research firm, include attorneys, engineering companies and suppliers, according to its website. A report last year by NASA, the U.S. space agency, found no electronic causes of the unintended acceleration in Toyotas. NHTSA should develop a long-term strategy for meeting the oversight challenges caused by automotive electronics systems, the panel said. &Ograve;NHTSA will continue to evaluate and improve every aspect of its work to keep the driving public safe, including research to assess potential safety concerns and help ensure the reliability of electronic control systems in vehicles,&Oacute; the agency said in an e-mailed statement. &Ograve;The agency will also further refine its strategic plan to address any potential technical and policy issues.&Oacute; Data Recorders The panel recommended that regulators require event data recorders in cars and that the safety agency research the design and placement of accelerator and brake pedals to minimize the risk of drivers mistaking one for the other. NHTSA plans to propose a rule requiring data recorders and to update its accelerator-control safety standard to require a so-called brake override system in a few months, Lynda Tran, an agency spokeswoman, said. Brake override controls allow the brake to supersede the accelerator pedal when both are pressed at the same time. That would enable a driver with a stuck accelerator pedal to stop the car by pressing the brake. Today&Otilde;s report &Ograve;does close the book&Oacute; on any remaining Toyota unintended acceleration questions, U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood told reporters today in Washington. The report &Ograve;sustains the work that we did and verifies the solutions that we found,&Oacute; he said. Jan 18, 2012
Travalliance, Carnival Cruise Line Travel&Otilde;s First Responders. If a tragedy like we just experienced with Costa Concordia this past weekend isn&Otilde;t a wake-up call for the cruise industry to turn back to travel agents, I don&Otilde;t know what is. You might be asking yourself what the connection is between this tragedy and travel agents, as well as questioning my judgment, but sit tight for a moment and understand it&Otilde;s actually about connections. The cruise industry is faced with yet another challenge since consumers will have the images of the Costa Concordia, tipped on its side and half submerged, in their minds for a while. For those who have cruised before, this won&Otilde;t deter them from future travels, but for those who have yet to take a cruise -- they might just be staying ashore. That was a point I drove home in a number of consumer media interviews I did following the Carnival Splendor engine fire in November 2010. If you&Otilde;ve ever cruised you know that these incidents are extremely rare and you probably won&Otilde;t be dissuaded from taking a cruise again. I wish I could say the same for those who have yet to cruise. The timing doesn&Otilde;t help in the case of the Costa Concordia, since the incident occurred during the cruise industry&Otilde;s most important month -- January is part of the so-called cruise Wave period, when travel agents make a lot of cruise bookings. The images of the Concordia will be pounded into consumers&Otilde; heads by the media while the lawyers will be pounding their desks and talking about going after Costa parent Carnival Corporation in court. The fact that anyone without a serious injury will have a tough time extracting anything due to the nature of cruise contracts probably won&Otilde;t stop them. That&Otilde;s the inherent danger for the cruise industry as a whole. It&Otilde;s not the facts about safety at sea or even about the passengers; it&Otilde;s about a sensational news story that has the ability to profoundly impact all cruise lines, not just Costa. I witnessed this first hand when I appeared on Fox News on Saturday Night on the Judge Jeanine show. I was invited to comment on the Concordia tragedy along with a maritime attorney and a criminal defense attorney. For a look at that segment, click on Mark Murphy Travels. That brings me to what I call travel&Otilde;s first responders -- the people who step in after the real first responders compete their rescue and recovery operation. And travel&Otilde;s first responders just happen to be travel agents, the same people who still sell most cruise vacations. These agents, located in literally every town and city in the country, are on the front lines thwarting the negative press that is raining down on the cruise industry today. They used to simply speak one on one to individual clients who were considering a cruise, but with social media they can expand their reach exponentially. A 100,000 travel agents multiplied by their individual connections on Facebook have the potential to reach tens of millions of consumers with a message about the real facts on safety at sea. The cruise industry would certainly be wise to harness that power to tell its story. Mark Murphy is president and CEO of Travalliance, parent of TravelPulse.com, Agent@Home magazine, Vacation Agent magazine, Travel Agent Academy, Virtual Travel Events and Agent Studio. Jan 16, 2012
TravelPulse, Carnival Survey: Cruise clients are showing concern over Concordia tragedy. A survey by TravelPulse.com of about 1,500 travel agents in the country indicated an increase in concern from booked cruise clients in the wake of the sinking of the Costa Concordia. The survey reveals that 37% of agents were contacted by clients scheduled for cruises in 2012. A third of clients cited the general safety of cruising as their top concern. About 10% of clients with 2012 cruises said they were considering canceling their cruises. Jan 19, 2012
