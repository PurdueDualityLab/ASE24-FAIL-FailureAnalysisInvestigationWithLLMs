Air China Air China begins replacing 747s with 777s on US routes. Air China will debut its Boeing 777-300ER Feb. 1, on the Los Angeles (LAX)-Beijing (PEK) night flight, replacing a 747-400. Air China, which is the only carrier to provide nonstop service between the two cities, doubled the daily service in September. It will go one step further to enhance the route in June when it plans to upgrade the 747-400 day flight between LAX and PEK to the 777-300ER. The aircraft&Otilde;s three-class configuration includes eight first-class suites, 41 lie-flat business-class seats and 259 economy seats.

Alaska Airlines, Horizon Air Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air Operating Limited Schedules in Seattle. Freezing rain and snow continue to affect Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air operations, which forced the carriers to cancel 310 flights to and from Seattle by early evening, affecting 29,000 passengers. Only 15 of Alaska's 114 daily flights and one Horizon flight had departed Seattle by that time as the region was hit by an extraordinary ice storm. 'We are doing our best to operate as many flights as possible to get people where they need to go as we cope with severe ice accumulation on our planes,' Alaska Airlines' President Brad Tilden said. 'We appreciate customers' patience and understanding as we contend with the freezing rain that has disrupted travel throughout the region. Our operational decisions will continue to be guided by our commitment to safety.' Tilden advised customers to check the status of their flights online at www.alaskaair.com and not drive to the airport unless their flight is scheduled to operate. Both airlines are working to re-accommodate passengers whose flights have been disrupted. Passengers booked on canceled flights to or from Seattle between Jan. 17 and Jan. 20 may request a refund of the unused portion of their ticket at www.alaskaair.com through Jan. 25. Customers who need to reschedule their travel should call Alaska Airlines Reservations at 1-800-ALASKAAIR (1-800-252-7522 or TTY/TDD line 1-800-392-0228). The airline is waiving change fees. Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air will attempt to operate 20 departures from Seattle each for the rest of the day, if weather conditions permit. Weather reports forecast freezing rain until midnight with rain expected tomorrow. If that holds true, the carriers expect to return to mostly normal operations on Friday, however, the forecasts have been changing frequently. By the numbers: Due to the unusual icing conditions, it is taking one hour to deice one aircraft &Ntilde; four times longer than normal &Ntilde; and requires quadruple the amount of deicing fluid. Sixteen deicing trucks are being used to fight snow and ice. The trucks use forced air in conjunction with de-icing fluid, making them more efficient while using less fluid. Since 2008, the airline has increased its holding capacity of de-icing fluid at Sea-Tac by 70 percent. Fifty phones and computer stations have been set up in the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport terminal to enable additional agents to rebook customers faster. More than 345 Alaska Airlines' reservations agents are working to assist customers &Ntilde; a 35 percent increase in staffing. As many as 750 calls made to Alaska's reservations center were on hold at one time. As many as 120 employees have been staying in hotels near Sea-Tac Airport the past two nights to ensure they could make it to work. More than 30 employees from Alaska Airlines' Corporate Headquarters are volunteering at the airport today to assist customers. Due to the ongoing possibility of adverse weather and as a precaution, the airlines are not allowing unaccompanied minors or checked pets to travel at this time. Jan 19, 2012

British Airway, Boeing British Airways Flies Newly Refurbished Boeing 777-200. British Airway's customers flying on a recent Boston flight were the first to experience the airline's very latest seats and cabins following the first complete refit of one of BA's Boeing 777-200s. The aircraft was the first of 18 to be fitted with British Airways' recently launched First cabin, new World Traveller and World Traveller Plus cabins and the airline's latest Thales in-flight entertainment system. The multi-million pound refurbishment gives the 18 Boeing 777-200s the same contemporary interiors as British Airways' six brand new Boeing 777-300ERs. Frank van der Post, British Airways' managing director of brands and customer experience, said: 'This exciting and ambitious refit now brings our 777s right up to date, with new interiors and the very latest inflight entertainment system. 'We have had fantastic customer reaction to our new fleet of Boeing 777-300ERs, which originally showcased our new cabins, and we know those who travel on these 18 aircraft will be equally impressed with our investment. 'Customers will be able to enjoy the very best travel experience British Airways has to offer, with more comfortable seats and brighter, more contemporary cabins.' Over the next five years British Airways will be investing more than UKP5bn in new aircraft, smarter cabins, elegant lounges, and new technologies to make life more comfortable in the air and on the ground. It takes British Airways' Cardiff-based engineers, at the airline's Welsh maintenance base, approximately a month, or 5,700 man hours, to carefully remove a 777's old seats and interiors and replace them with the airline's very latest cabins. Each aircraft will also have a staggering 13 kilometres of wiring removed and new fibre optic cables installed to power the new in-flight entertainment system. New widescreens will be fitted in Club World and customers flying on these refitted Boeing 777-200s will also be able to experience the airline's sophisticated new First cabin. New seats and cabins in World Traveller Plus and World Traveller, feature the latest cushioning technology and in-seat power sockets. The Thales in-flight entertainment system offers over 700 hours of movies, TV and music options on demand; that's more than 230 TV programs, 70 films and 400 CDs, providing customers with 50 per cent more choice on movies and doubling the range of TV and music options, as well as plug and play technology. Each cabin also gets bigger, high-resolution widescreens: customers in World Traveller will be able to watch TV and films on 35 per cent larger video touchscreens (now 8.9 inches); in World Traveller Plus they are 60 per cent larger (now 10.6 inches); Club World widescreens increase by 16.3 per cent (now 12.1 inches) while the new First screens increase by 275 per cent (now 15.4 inches) Jan 20, 2012
British Airways British Airways' false alarm causes panic in cabin. British Airways is apologizing to passengers of a trans-Atlantic flight after a recorded message announcing the plane was about to make an emergency landing in the ocean was mistakenly played over the intercom. The incident, which happened on a flight from Miami to London late Friday, caused panic in the cabin. Passengers told British newspapers that about three hours into the journey, a recorded voice suddenly announced: 'This is an emergency, we will shortly be making an emergency landing on water.' In fact, the flight was proceeding normally, but the frightening message led passengers to assume the worst. 'We looked at each other and figured we were both about to die. Families with children were distraught and people were in tears. It was very distressing,' passenger Duncan Farquharson told The Telegraph. 'About 30 seconds later, one of the cabin crew told us to ignore the announcement. ... Imagining yourself plunging towards a cold, watery grave in the middle of the Atlantic is a pretty horrific thought, but they seemed very blas[#x17d] about it.' British Airways isn't saying whether a technical glitch or human error caused the recording to play. 'The cabin crew canceled the announcement immediately and reassured customers that the flight was operating normally,' the airline said in a statement. 'We apologized to customers for causing them undue concern.' The plane landed safely at its destination. Jan 18, 2012
Brussels Airlines Brussels Airlines upgrades widebody fleet interiors. Brussels Airlines will invest EUR30 million (USD38.3 million) to revamp the interiors of its widebody fleet, comprising five Airbus A330-300 and two -200s. Business class will be fitted with full-flat beds with built-in LED mood lighting; economy seats will be equipped with the IMS Company&Otilde;s innovative seat-centric RAVE inflight entertainment system. The Brussels-based carrier, in which Lufthansa holds 45%, has six A330s with the seventh, a -200 arriving in a couple of months. The first refurnished aircraft will be placed into service from spring, and by year end all seven aircraft will be fitted with the new seats, lavatories and galleys. Brussels Airlines&Otilde;s new daily scheduled services to New York JFK operate with the new inflight product and the upgrade will be gradually available on the African network. Lufthansa Technik Malta will perform the interior retrofits. Management considered introducing a mid-tier cabin but decided to stick to its current business class/economy class configuration &Ograve;as this corresponds better to the demands of our markets. Besides, not one carrier in the Lufthansa Group offers a premium-economy product,&Oacute; VP Communications Geert Sciot said. The A330-30 will have 30 seats in business class and 248 in economy class; 24 of the 30 business-class seats will have direct aisle access and 10 will have no adjacent seat. Jan 16, 2012
Cheapflights Cheapflights Declares a 'War on Gloom'. Rising APD, a dire economy and the post-Christmas blues all combine to make January an even duller month than usual this year. However, in spite of those factors, Cheapflights.co.uk, the online leader in deals publishing, found in a recent survey that travel is still a priority for 83 per cent of the 15,000 Brits who participated. In fact, they're cutting back in other areas of expenditure to protect their travel budget. Cheapflights.co.uk is therefore waging a 'War on Gloom' (#DefyTheGloom) by declaring travel to be the perfect antidote for beating the January blues with its list of Top 25 Cheap and Cheerful destinations. 'Are you fed up of reading gloomy headlines? So are we. We know that UK consumers are cutting back elsewhere to save up for a holiday. At Cheapflights we decided we could help and declared our 'War on Gloom.' Together we can beat it! We have some great Cheap and Cheerful destinations and above all the widest range of cheap flight deals to help you escape. Click your mouse and grab your bucket and spade to take a stand for holiday cheer,' says Hugo Burge, CEO for Cheapflights Media. To compile the Top 25 list, Cheapflights.co.uk took its 100 most popular destinations from December and calculated their affordability and appeal based on a combination of factors: return flights, weather in January and February, recent currency performance, ground costs and third party rankings on safety for visitors. The list is a combination of mainly exotic, long-haul destinations where the sun shines most of the year and ground costs are incredibly low. There are a few European destinations in the mix such as Prague, Amsterdam and Dublin, but our top five are all a bit of a trek -- however, they are great places to get away for a fun, affordable and off-the-beaten path experience. Following these five was a list of great spots within India all scoring the same since the weather, costs, airfare deals and other factors were so in sync. As a result, we ended up counting the country of India as a single Cheap and Cheerful destination. The top five destinations are: 1. Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam 2. Havana, Cuba 3. Marrakech, Morocco 4. Hanoi, Vietnam 5. Douala, Cameroon With year-round warm weather, a stable safety record, and incredibly low ground costs, it's no surprise that Vietnam features twice within the first five destinations. Its two featured cities are both quite different. Ho Chi Minh City is relatively young compared to Hanoi. This bustling city is more of a cultural break than a beach getaway, but it won't disappoint as an experience. Visitors should be sure to check out attractions like the War Remnants Museum and dinner cruises on the Saigon River. The older city of Hanoi offers quite a different experience to Ho Chi Minh. Spirituality and history set the tone here with a fascinating mix of architecture that combines French-colonial villas alongside temples that date back to the 11th century. There are more than 600 temples to explore in total and despite the bustle; the way of life here is calm and greatly appealing to visitors. Hanoi is also a great base from which to explore other parts of the country such as Ha Long Bay, touring the south or nearby hikes. This is the perfect place for intrepid travellers and those who enjoy the outdoors. The attractions of Havana, Cuba, need little introduction. Year-round sunshine, white sand beaches, great cocktails, sumptuous food and world famous music combine to offer all the things most would seek on holiday. The country in general is still relatively unspoilt given that it has yet to be overridden by tourists, so visitors will get an authentic Cuban experience and low ground costs mean it's incredibly cheap. Marrakech is a favourite destination among Brits and is still climbing in popularity. Despite recent tensions in countries within the surrounding region, Marrakech's hasn't been affected and is still very safe. The fact that budget airlines now fly there means that fares can come in at UKP100 and even less, and ground costs are spectacularly low once you get there, so it's a great all round destination. Its warm weather and landscape of mountains, nearby beaches and unique architecture offers something for all travel tastes. Culture vultures should start in the Old Town while visitors in general should head to the famous souks within the city centre and spend evenings in the many rooftop cafes. Fifth on the list is Cameroon. While this might be one of the more unexpected destinations, it actually has a lot to offer the intrepid traveller. Having passed a law to limit the number of terms a president is allowed to serve, its PM Paul Biya was removed just last year when the law came into effect. Presumably, this sign of political change means the country is opening up to tourism and business. It's still not a major tourist destination so it gives travellers a glimpse of the 'real Africa.' Cameroon offers rainforests, deserts, wildlife parks and great beaches. Its warm weather, safe environment and incredibly cheap ground costs combine to make it another ideal Cheap and Cheerful destination.

To go one step further, Cheapflights has also launched The Great Escape giveaway on Facebook. The winner of this sweepstakes competition will receive UKP2000 in travel money to plan an escape to a cheap and cheerful destination of their own choosing. Cheapflights is also giving away travel must-have Kindles every week in the run up to the grand prize draw. The contest is open worldwide, so jump and get ready to get away. Jan 16, 2012
Chicago's O'Hare Airport Winter Storm Dumps Snow On US Midwest. A winter storm dumping snow across the US Midwest on Friday forced the cancellation of more than 600 flights at Chicago's O'Hare Airport, while slick roads and poor visibility snarled traffic across the region. The storm was expected to drop 1 to 8 inches of snow from the Dakotas to the lower Great Lakes, with Chicago among the hardest hit among the big cities. Up to 7 inches of snow was expected in Chicago, where Southwest Airlines also cancelled all of its flights from 2 pm to 5 pm at Midway Airport and delayed flights scheduled for 5 pm to 7 pm, according to the Chicago aviation department. Milwaukee and Cleveland both were expected to be hit with up to 5 inches of snow. Several smaller school districts outside of Milwaukee have cancelled after-school programmes. The storm dropped about an inch of snow on Friday morning in the Twin Cities area, where there were reports of hundreds of minor accidents on slick roads and long morning rush hour delays. Snow fall totals were heavier south of the Twin Cities. Reports of 4 to 6 inches were common from far southern Minnesota, across northeast Iowa and southwest Wisconsin, the National Weather Service said. The snow is expected to push into the northeast, with up to six inches of the white stuff expected from Pennsylvania through central Maine Saturday, and up to four inches in New York City. In Washington state, which has seen unusually heavy snow, two climbers and two campers are missing in Mount Rainier National Park. Searches were suspended on Friday afternoon because of the weather, which includes 40 mph winds, poor visibility, and thick fog. The Puget Sound region continued to see scattered power outages on Friday, affecting about 275,000 customers. Seattle is preparing for possible flooding, with crews clearing storm drains of snow and debris. Jan 20, 2012

FlightView Travel Industry Plans to Take Flight Information to New Heights in 2012. Just weeks into the New Year, cutting edge airlines, airports, hotels and other businesses are upping the ante on how-and-where customers can access up-to-the-minute flight information, according to FlightView, the leading provider of day-of-travel information for the travel industry. &Ograve;Last year, airports and airlines looking for a competitive advantage were quick to implement mobile websites, native apps and new terminal displays,&Oacute; said Mike Benjamin, CEO of FlightView. &Ograve;This year, simply making content available through technology isn&Otilde;t enough. Travelers are demanding that the industry goes beyond only providing the must-have travel information, and instead offer information that truly makes their travel experience more enjoyable, productive and less stressful.&Oacute; To keep pace with the industry and customer expectations, here&Otilde;s what airports and airlines should focus on in 2012: Providing greater transparency into delayed flights. The lack of details communicated by airlines concerning delayed flights was a major problem in 2011. A gate-side survey found that 62 percent of travelers are frustrated when they&Otilde;re at the gate, learn that their flight has been delayed and can&Otilde;t get enough information on a new take-off time. The opportunity in the year ahead: airports and airlines can provide more detailed information for a delayed flight with gate displays that visually show passengers where their plane is located, and when it&Otilde;s expected to arrive. Perfecting mobile content. Airports and airlines have a huge opportunity to improve customer service by moving beyond just offering flight status information on mobile websites and apps, to providing nearby amenities, boarding messages, upgrade information, social sharing functionality and other day-of-travel information. The result: a more addictive and informative mobile tool that leads to higher usage rates. Tapping the cloud for flight information. Limited resources and an increased pressure to ensure that flight information is up-to-date, accurate, and always available will fuel more airports and airlines to enlist third-party cloud providers to manage, host, and distribute their flight information. The result: more reliable travel information at a lower cost. In addition to airports and airlines moving toward making real-time flight information easily accessible and all-inclusive, FlightView expects malls, hotels and other businesses to begin to leverage flight information as a competitive advantage and revenue driver in 2012. Malls and retail outlets are already beginning to display flight information so consumers can better gauge how much time they have to shop before heading to the airport to travel or pick someone up. While select hotels and public attractions have been showcasing flight-information displays for a few years to build loyalty and deliver another value-add service to customers, the trend is expected to pick up in 2012. &Ograve;Travelers crave real-time flight information, and more venues will aim to satisfy that appetite in 2012,&Oacute; said Benjamin. &Ograve;We expect to see more outlets &ETH; including malls, hotels and consumer websites &ETH; leverage travel content to build customer relationships and loyalty.&Oacute; FlightView&Otilde;s own mobile website and travel apps, available on the Android, iPhone, BlackBerry and Palm, are the leading, trusted smart phone native apps for more than one million users nationwide.

Lufthansa Lufthansa 747 operates first transatlantic biofuel flight to US. Lufthansa (LH) has concluded a long-term biofuel study by operating the world&Otilde;s first biofuel-powered transatlantic commercial flight to the US. Flight LH 418 landed at Washington Dulles Jan. 12 after an 8-hr. and 20 min. flight from Frankfurt (FRA). The Boeing 747-400 carried approximately 40 tons of biofuel mix. LH said carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions were reduced by about 38 tons. Captain Rudolf Seebass and flight officer Daniel Rieter commanded the flight and said it was a totally normal revenue flight. Passengers were informed once onboard that biofuel would be used and were given explanatory brochures. &Ograve;They applauded when the announcement was made,&Oacute; Seebass said. Through its burnFAIR project, LH was the first airline to use biofuel on regularly scheduled commercial flights in an effort to study the long-term effect of biofuel on engine maintenance and engine life, as well as the environmental impact. From July 15 to Dec. 27, 2011, a LH Airbus A321 operating on the Hamburg-FRA route had one engine powered by a 50-50 blend of regular fuel and biosynthetic kerosene. In all, 1,187 biofuel flights were conducted and, according to initial calculations, total consumption of the biokerosene mix amounted to 1,556 tons and CO2 emissions were reduced by 1,471 tons. &Ograve;This is the best news we could give the industry because it shows that we really can do normal operations with biofuel,&Oacute; said LH VP-Aviation Biofuel Joachim Buse. He said the transatlantic flight was particularly important because if LH could use biofuels on all US flights, it estimates it could reduce CO2 emissions by about 15,000 tons per week. The airline operates around 400 weekly flights to17 US cities. The biofuel mix used by LH is mostly based on Camelina oil from the US with some Jatropha-based oil from Brazil and some animal fat from Finland. Jan 16, 2012
