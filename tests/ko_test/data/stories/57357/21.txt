Airbus CEO admits mistakes with A380

AIRBUS chief executive Tom Enders, asked to explain the recent glitches that have hit the A380 superjumbo, is not offering excuses - and is candid about it.
'The only thing I can say is we screwed up and we'll fix it, whatever the cost,' he said yesterday.
He was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an aviation summit ahead of today's opening of Singapore Airshow 2012.
In recent weeks, operators of Airbus' double-decker jets, such as Singapore Airlines (SIA) and Qantas, have had their jets inspected, and in some cases, repaired, on the instructions of the European Aviation Safety Agency.
The safety agency's directive came after wing cracks were found on a Qantas aircraft undergoing repairs here, following a November 2010 incident, when one of its engines exploded in mid-air.
The latest directive from the agency came last Wednesday, when it ordered A380 operators to inspect eventually all the superjumbos in their fleets.
The agency had earlier ordered similar checks, but not to all aircraft. The move then affected a third of the global fleet of nearly 70 A380s.
But A380 operator SIA still believes it is a good plane, despite the trouble of having to take these aircraft out of commercial service for the checks and repairs.
The airline's chief executive, Mr Goh Choon Phong said: 'With new aircraft, there may occasionally be issues that we have to address... but it's quite clear that even with the defects we've seen, there is no safety concern.'
SIA has 15 of the jumbo jets in its fleet and will take delivery of another four in the coming months.
It still has options to buy another six.
Asked whether it would translate these options into firm orders, Mr Goh replied: 'Whether we extend the options really depends on the commercial demand for the aircraft and this is something we're still reviewing.'
Meanwhile, Mr Enders is confident that the recent hiccups will not blight the credibility of the superjumbo, or dim its appeal to airlines and travellers.
He said: 'We're only at the beginning. China Southern and Korean Air are now flying the aircraft; this year, Thai Airways and Malaysia Airlines too. I'm quite sure we'll see a lot of A380s in the future.'
