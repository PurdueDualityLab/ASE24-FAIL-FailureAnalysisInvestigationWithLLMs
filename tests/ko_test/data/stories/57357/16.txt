A barge carrying a crane and other equipment hitched itself to the toppled Costa Concordia on Tuesday, signalling the start of preliminary operations to remove 500,000 gallons of fuel from the grounded cruise ship before it leaks into the pristine Tuscan sea.
Actual pumping of the oil isn't expected to begin until Saturday, but teams from the Dutch shipwreck salvage firm Smit were working on the bow of the Concordia on Tuesday, and divers were to make underwater inspections to identify the precise locations of the fuel tanks.
They were at work on the now-hitched Meloria barge as divers who blasted through a submerged section of the third-floor deck located another body from the wreckage, bringing the death toll to 16. Seven of the badly decomposed bodies found so far remain unidentified.
The Concordia ran aground and capsized off the Tuscan island of Giglio on Jan. 13 after the captain veered from his approved course and gashed the ship's hull on a reef, forcing the panicked evacuation of 4,200 passengers and crew.
|Giglio and its waters are part of a protected seven-island marine park, favoured by VIPs and known for clear water and porpoises, dolphins and whales.
Officials have identified an initial six fuel tanks that will be drilled into, tapped and outfitted with hoses to vacuum out the oil from the ship. Franco Gabrielli, head of the national civil protection agency, told reporters Tuesday that once those initial six tanks are emptied, 50 per cent of the fuel aboard the ship will have been extracted.
The pumping will continue 24 hours a day barring rough seas or technical glitches, he said, noting that these six tanks are relatively easy to access.
The disaster prompted UNESCO to ask the Italian government to restrict access of large cruise ships to Venice, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The cultural organization charged that the liners cause water tides that erode building foundations, pollute the waterways and are an eyesore.
Venice officials have said that since tug boats guide the big cruise ships through the part of the lagoon weaving through the city, the risk of accidents is virtually eliminated.
