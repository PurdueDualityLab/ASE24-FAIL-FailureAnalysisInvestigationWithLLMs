Aegean Airlines Aegean reports strong international passenger growth in 2011. Star Alliance&Otilde;s Greek member Aegean Airlines (A3) reported a 4% growth in passengers carried last year to 6.5 million, owing to strong growth on its international network. International enplanements exceeded domestic passenger traffic for the first time. Passenger numbers on its international routes rose 15% to 3.5 million, whereas passengers carried on domestic routes fell 6% to 3 million (and by 15% in the last quarter of the year). The carrier said domestic boardings declined despite promotional offers that resulted in a 20% lower domestic average fare compared to 2007. &Ograve;We invest on strengthening our international presence and on supporting the Greek tourism both in Athens and in regional airports. Within the past six years, we have managed to triple the number of passengers traveled on our international network, despite the tough economic environment in Greece, the sharp rise in fuel prices and the significant high airport fees and taxes in Athens determined by the Greek state,&Oacute; MD Dimitris Gerogiannis said. Aegean operated 102 international routes from six airports in Greece&Ntilde;Athens, Heraklion, Rhodes, Kos, Thessaloniki and Corfu.
In response to the worsening Greek economic crisis, A3 will operate more direct international flights to/from regional airports. The investment resulted in a growth in international passengers of 37% to/from Rhodes, 23% to/from Heraklion and 10% to/from Thessaloniki to a total of 1.1 million international passengers. A3 said UK, Belgium, France, Israel and Russia markets have registered particularly high growth rates. Jan 20, 2012

Airbus, EASA, Qantas Airways, China Southern Airlines, Singapore Airlines, More cracks found in Airbus A380 wings. Airbus said on Thursday it had discovered more cracks in the wings of two A380 superjumbo aircraft but insisted the world's largest jetliner remained safe to fly. The announcement comes two weeks after tiny cracks were first reported in the wings of the 525-seat, double-decker aircraft, which entered service just over four years ago. 'Airbus confirms that some additional cracks have been found on a limited number of non-critical brackets ... inside the wings of some A380s,' the planemaker said in a statement. 'Airbus emphasizes that these cracks do not affect the safe operation of the aircraft.' The European Aviation Safety Authority (EASA) confirmed it would issue a bulletin Friday mandating precautionary checks. The latest cracking problem was discovered in two aircraft during a routine two-year inspection, an Airbus spokeswoman said. She declined to name the operators of the aircraft. No superjumbos have been grounded but the most heavily used aircraft -- those subjected to at least 1,800 take-offs and landings that impose the most strain on an airframe -- must be examined within four days, authorities said. Airlines operating Airbus SAS (EAD)&Otilde;s A380 superjumbo must ground 20 planes or almost one-third of the world fleet within the next six weeks to check for wing cracks. Carriers with A380s that have accumulated more than 1,300 takeoffs and landings must make the inspections, and any planes that have made more than 1,800 trips need to be checked within four days, the European Aviation Safety Agency said today. Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA), Air France and Emirates will need to take action soonest, based on flight figures, with the work likely to take up to 24 hours, according to the Asian carrier, which said six of its jets require scrutiny in the near term. EASA ordered the checks after the discovery of cracks in one wing led to detection of more serious fractures in other planes. &Ograve;This condition, if not detected and corrected, could potentially affect the structural integrity of the aeroplane,&Oacute; the safety organization said in today&Otilde;s airworthiness directive. &Ograve;The new form of cracking is more significant.&Oacute; The visual examinations don&Otilde;t require special gear and should be completed in a matter of hours, according to Airbus. Singapore Air spokesman Nicholas Ionides said planes could be still be out for a service for as much as a day, though there shouldn&Otilde;t be any impact on operations. Out of its fleet of 15 A380s, another four will need checks within the six-week period. &Ocirc;Reasonably Normal&Otilde; EASA issued its notice after Singapore Air and Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN) found the additional cracks in A380 wing-rib feet. The fissures, while &Ograve;embarrassing,&Oacute; pose no danger to passengers flying on the 68 A380s currently in service, Airbus Chief Executive Officer Tom Enders said late yesterday. The European Aviation Safety Agency acted after European planemaker Airbus disclosed two sets of cracks on its A380s just two weeks apart, and barely four years after the 525-seat double-decker passenger jet entered service. The second type of cracks, which like the first appeared on a bracket joining the exterior to metal ribs inside the wings, was 'more significant' and could develop on other aircraft if the problem is not addressed, the Cologne-based agency said. 'This condition, if not detected and corrected, could potentially affect the structural integrity of the aeroplane,' EASA said in an airworthiness directive issued on Friday. Inspectors ordered checks within six weeks for another category of aircraft with a history of 1,300 to 1,800 cycles. In total, the two-speed recommendations cover 20 aircraft including 10 from Singapore Airlines, seven from Emirates, one from Air France and two test planes, according to a published list of serial numbers at a380production.com. Experts say engineers must carry out visual checks by climbing inside the ribcage of each UK-built wing. The process is expected to take each jet out of service for about 24 hours. Airbus said the order demonstrated the 'airworthiness process is working' and reiterated the aircraft is safe to fly. It has dismissed calls to ground the jets but the Australian engineering union which handles routine servicing and engine checks on superjumbos operated by Qantas Airways said it was concerned about the speed of the planemaker's response. 'They have described these as tiny cracks, but every crack starts off as a tiny crack and they can grow very quickly,' said Stephen Purvinas, federal secretary of the Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association who has called for the grounding. The discovery comes 14 months after a Rolls-Royce engine blowout on a Qantas A380 triggered global headlines. It was during a USD130 million repair job on that same aircraft that hairline cracks in the wing first came to light. Industry sources said the second set of cracks appeared on aircraft operated by Dubai's Emirates, the largest A380 customer. Emirates declined comment but said on Thursday it continued to monitor its fleet and safety was its top priority. EADS subsidiary Airbus has so far delivered 68 superjumbos, starting with Singapore Airlines which took the first aircraft in December 2007, followed by Dubai's Emirates and Qantas Airways of Australia. Other operators include Air France, Germany's Lufthansa, Korean Air and China Southern. The latest problems were discovered in the same type of part as the earlier set of cracks, an L-shaped bracket which connects the wing's exterior to the internal 'rib' structure. A380 wings are manufactured in Broughton, north Wales, and shipped to Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France, for final assembly. Industry journal Air Transport Intelligence said the brackets, known as rib feet, had been stressed during the manufacturing process and that this was being fixed. The A380 -- developed at an estimated cost of 12 billion euros and built in Britain, France, Germany and Spain -- has enough room on its wings to park 70 cars and a wingspan of 79.8m (261ft 10in).

Blue Panorama, Seychelles Tourism Board Filling the vacuum of lost air service from Seychelles to Europe. In line with Seychelles&Otilde; ongoing drive to increase air access to the country after the cessation of Air Seychelles&Otilde; flights to European destinations, Alain St. Ange, CEO of the Seychelles Tourism Board, and Bernadette Wilemin, Seychelles&Otilde; Tourism Board&Otilde;s Director for Europe, held discussions with Franco C.B. Pecci, Chairman and CEO of Blue Panorama Airlines, and the company&Otilde;s Vice President of Sales, Remo Della Porta, concerning future cooperation in ensuring the success of the new Blue Panorama&Otilde;s service to Seychelles. The Italian Airline Company, Blue Panorama, has confirmed that they will start a weekly NONSTOP direct flight to Seychelles from Rome and Milan effective from February 14. From July, the airline will increase the their schedule to two weekly flights. &Ograve;In these challenging times, when cessation of service by Air Seychelles to Europe has created a vacuum of air access in certain of our core markets, it is essential that we quickly move to fill that vacuum and keep Seychelles very much in the sight of European consumers,&Oacute; explained Alain St. Ange. This meeting with Blue Panorama forms part of a strategy to secure direct NONSTOP air access to Seychelles from Europe and it can now also be confirmed that discussions with Air Austral are now in their final stage concerning two NONSTOP, direct flights between Paris and Seychelles, expected to commence in March 2012.

British Airway, Boeing British Airways Flies Newly Refurbished Boeing 777-200. British Airway's customers flying on a recent Boston flight were the first to experience the airline's very latest seats and cabins following the first complete refit of one of BA's Boeing 777-200s. The aircraft was the first of 18 to be fitted with British Airways' recently launched First cabin, new World Traveller and World Traveller Plus cabins and the airline's latest Thales in-flight entertainment system. The multi-million pound refurbishment gives the 18 Boeing 777-200s the same contemporary interiors as British Airways' six brand new Boeing 777-300ERs. Frank van der Post, British Airways' managing director of brands and customer experience, said: 'This exciting and ambitious refit now brings our 777s right up to date, with new interiors and the very latest inflight entertainment system. 'We have had fantastic customer reaction to our new fleet of Boeing 777-300ERs, which originally showcased our new cabins, and we know those who travel on these 18 aircraft will be equally impressed with our investment. 'Customers will be able to enjoy the very best travel experience British Airways has to offer, with more comfortable seats and brighter, more contemporary cabins.' Over the next five years British Airways will be investing more than UKP5bn in new aircraft, smarter cabins, elegant lounges, and new technologies to make life more comfortable in the air and on the ground. It takes British Airways' Cardiff-based engineers, at the airline's Welsh maintenance base, approximately a month, or 5,700 man hours, to carefully remove a 777's old seats and interiors and replace them with the airline's very latest cabins. Each aircraft will also have a staggering 13 kilometres of wiring removed and new fibre optic cables installed to power the new in-flight entertainment system. New widescreens will be fitted in Club World and customers flying on these refitted Boeing 777-200s will also be able to experience the airline's sophisticated new First cabin. New seats and cabins in World Traveller Plus and World Traveller, feature the latest cushioning technology and in-seat power sockets. The Thales in-flight entertainment system offers over 700 hours of movies, TV and music options on demand; that's more than 230 TV programs, 70 films and 400 CDs, providing customers with 50 per cent more choice on movies and doubling the range of TV and music options, as well as plug and play technology. Each cabin also gets bigger, high-resolution widescreens: customers in World Traveller will be able to watch TV and films on 35 per cent larger video touchscreens (now 8.9 inches); in World Traveller Plus they are 60 per cent larger (now 10.6 inches); Club World widescreens increase by 16.3 per cent (now 12.1 inches) while the new First screens increase by 275 per cent (now 15.4 inches) Jan 20, 2012
British Airways British Airways' false alarm causes panic in cabin. British Airways is apologizing to passengers of a trans-Atlantic flight after a recorded message announcing the plane was about to make an emergency landing in the ocean was mistakenly played over the intercom. The incident, which happened on a flight from Miami to London late Friday, caused panic in the cabin. Passengers told British newspapers that about three hours into the journey, a recorded voice suddenly announced: 'This is an emergency, we will shortly be making an emergency landing on water.' In fact, the flight was proceeding normally, but the frightening message led passengers to assume the worst. 'We looked at each other and figured we were both about to die. Families with children were distraught and people were in tears. It was very distressing,' passenger Duncan Farquharson told The Telegraph. 'About 30 seconds later, one of the cabin crew told us to ignore the announcement. ... Imagining yourself plunging towards a cold, watery grave in the middle of the Atlantic is a pretty horrific thought, but they seemed very blas[#x17d] about it.' British Airways isn't saying whether a technical glitch or human error caused the recording to play. 'The cabin crew canceled the announcement immediately and reassured customers that the flight was operating normally,' the airline said in a statement. 'We apologized to customers for causing them undue concern.' The plane landed safely at its destination. Jan 18, 2012
Brussels Airlines Brussels Airlines upgrades widebody fleet interiors. Brussels Airlines will invest EUR30 million (USD38.3 million) to revamp the interiors of its widebody fleet, comprising five Airbus A330-300 and two -200s. Business class will be fitted with full-flat beds with built-in LED mood lighting; economy seats will be equipped with the IMS Company&Otilde;s innovative seat-centric RAVE inflight entertainment system. The Brussels-based carrier, in which Lufthansa holds 45%, has six A330s with the seventh, a -200 arriving in a couple of months. The first refurnished aircraft will be placed into service from spring, and by year end all seven aircraft will be fitted with the new seats, lavatories and galleys. Brussels Airlines&Otilde;s new daily scheduled services to New York JFK operate with the new inflight product and the upgrade will be gradually available on the African network. Lufthansa Technik Malta will perform the interior retrofits. Management considered introducing a mid-tier cabin but decided to stick to its current business class/economy class configuration &Ograve;as this corresponds better to the demands of our markets. Besides, not one carrier in the Lufthansa Group offers a premium-economy product,&Oacute; VP Communications Geert Sciot said. The A330-30 will have 30 seats in business class and 248 in economy class; 24 of the 30 business-class seats will have direct aisle access and 10 will have no adjacent seat. Jan 16, 2012
Cheapflights Cheapflights Declares a 'War on Gloom'. Rising APD, a dire economy and the post-Christmas blues all combine to make January an even duller month than usual this year. However, in spite of those factors, Cheapflights.co.uk, the online leader in deals publishing, found in a recent survey that travel is still a priority for 83 per cent of the 15,000 Brits who participated. In fact, they're cutting back in other areas of expenditure to protect their travel budget. Cheapflights.co.uk is therefore waging a 'War on Gloom' (#DefyTheGloom) by declaring travel to be the perfect antidote for beating the January blues with its list of Top 25 Cheap and Cheerful destinations. 'Are you fed up of reading gloomy headlines? So are we. We know that UK consumers are cutting back elsewhere to save up for a holiday. At Cheapflights we decided we could help and declared our 'War on Gloom.' Together we can beat it! We have some great Cheap and Cheerful destinations and above all the widest range of cheap flight deals to help you escape. Click your mouse and grab your bucket and spade to take a stand for holiday cheer,' says Hugo Burge, CEO for Cheapflights Media. To compile the Top 25 list, Cheapflights.co.uk took its 100 most popular destinations from December and calculated their affordability and appeal based on a combination of factors: return flights, weather in January and February, recent currency performance, ground costs and third party rankings on safety for visitors. The list is a combination of mainly exotic, long-haul destinations where the sun shines most of the year and ground costs are incredibly low. There are a few European destinations in the mix such as Prague, Amsterdam and Dublin, but our top five are all a bit of a trek -- however, they are great places to get away for a fun, affordable and off-the-beaten path experience. Following these five was a list of great spots within India all scoring the same since the weather, costs, airfare deals and other factors were so in sync. As a result, we ended up counting the country of India as a single Cheap and Cheerful destination. The top five destinations are: 1. Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam 2. Havana, Cuba 3. Marrakech, Morocco 4. Hanoi, Vietnam 5. Douala, Cameroon With year-round warm weather, a stable safety record, and incredibly low ground costs, it's no surprise that Vietnam features twice within the first five destinations. Its two featured cities are both quite different. Ho Chi Minh City is relatively young compared to Hanoi. This bustling city is more of a cultural break than a beach getaway, but it won't disappoint as an experience. Visitors should be sure to check out attractions like the War Remnants Museum and dinner cruises on the Saigon River. The older city of Hanoi offers quite a different experience to Ho Chi Minh. Spirituality and history set the tone here with a fascinating mix of architecture that combines French-colonial villas alongside temples that date back to the 11th century. There are more than 600 temples to explore in total and despite the bustle; the way of life here is calm and greatly appealing to visitors. Hanoi is also a great base from which to explore other parts of the country such as Ha Long Bay, touring the south or nearby hikes. This is the perfect place for intrepid travellers and those who enjoy the outdoors. The attractions of Havana, Cuba, need little introduction. Year-round sunshine, white sand beaches, great cocktails, sumptuous food and world famous music combine to offer all the things most would seek on holiday. The country in general is still relatively unspoilt given that it has yet to be overridden by tourists, so visitors will get an authentic Cuban experience and low ground costs mean it's incredibly cheap. Marrakech is a favourite destination among Brits and is still climbing in popularity. Despite recent tensions in countries within the surrounding region, Marrakech's hasn't been affected and is still very safe. The fact that budget airlines now fly there means that fares can come in at UKP100 and even less, and ground costs are spectacularly low once you get there, so it's a great all round destination. Its warm weather and landscape of mountains, nearby beaches and unique architecture offers something for all travel tastes. Culture vultures should start in the Old Town while visitors in general should head to the famous souks within the city centre and spend evenings in the many rooftop cafes. Fifth on the list is Cameroon. While this might be one of the more unexpected destinations, it actually has a lot to offer the intrepid traveller. Having passed a law to limit the number of terms a president is allowed to serve, its PM Paul Biya was removed just last year when the law came into effect. Presumably, this sign of political change means the country is opening up to tourism and business. It's still not a major tourist destination so it gives travellers a glimpse of the 'real Africa.' Cameroon offers rainforests, deserts, wildlife parks and great beaches. Its warm weather, safe environment and incredibly cheap ground costs combine to make it another ideal Cheap and Cheerful destination.

China Airlines China Airlines to end Heathrow-Taiwan flights. China Airlines has blamed high oil prices and the European debt crisis for its decision to end the direct flights from Heathrow to Taipei from March 25. The Taiwan-based carrier currently flies on the route twice a week but it is now establishing a daily codeshare flight with KLMKoninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij (Royal Aviation Company) the flag carrier of the Netherlands and a good example of how acronyms can aid simple discourse. from London to Amsterdam where it will connect with its existing Amsterdam-Bangkok-Taipei service. China Airlines said that fuel costs and the eurozone&Otilde;s economic problems have affected the profitability of its direct service to London, which was launched in March 2010. The airline stopped accepting bookings for its London service beyond March earlier this month, causing speculations that the route would be cancelled. The change still needs to be approved by regulators, but China Airlines expects to begin accepting reservations for London again after February 15. Passengers who have already booked the Taipei-London direct flight for after March 25 will be contacted by the airline about alternative arrangements. A airline source said that there is a possibility that the direct flight to London will resume when the carrier receives its fuel-efficient Airbus A350s, which are due to be delivered in 2015. The Taipei-London route is currently serviced by the Airbus A340. Jan 20, 2012
Cityjet Cityjet to add London City flights to Brest. Air France subsidiary Cityjet will commence twice-weekly flights between London City and the French city of Brest from March 30.

El Al Airlines Turkish tourism courts Israeli travelers. Israel's relations with Turkey may have reached a historic low following the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador from Ankara, but Turkey still plans to take part in a tourism fair scheduled to be held in Tel Aviv next month. The international tourism fair &ETH; held annually at Tel Aviv's Exhibition Grounds &ETH; is sponsored by the Tourism Ministry, Israel Hotel Association and El Al Airlines, and serves are a unique opportunity to promote tourism in Israel. More than 800 representatives from 28 countries are expected to take part in the fair this year and present intriguing destinations, attractions and vacation offers. The countries taking part in the fair this year include Sri Lanka, Albania, Papua New Guinea, Taiwan and others. 'This is one of the main regional tourism fairs and the number and quality of the participants can be seen as an expression of trust in Israeli tourism,' says Tourism Minister Stas Misezhnikov. Despite the tense diplomatic relations, the Turks are interested in seeing Israeli tourists return to their vacation resorts and are trying to make them favor Turkey over Greece and Cyprus, which have served as an alternative in the past few years. 'I am glad that in spite of the diplomatic tensions Turkey is still interested in taking part in the tourism conference,' says Eyal Shmueli, the publisher and editor-in-chief of Israel Travel News and one of the fair's initiators. 'The Turkish participation proves that they are interested in bringing the Israeli tourist back,' He adds. Jan 16, 2012
Emirates, Qatar Airways, Etihad Airlines The Seychelles Islands&Eacute;accessible as never before. Seychelles has taken the opportunity to launch its new tourism campaign, &Ograve;The Seychelles Islands&Eacute;accessible as never before,&Oacute; at the FITUR tourism fair in Madrid, held between January 18-22, 2012. The new campaign is a reflection of Seychelles&Otilde; determination to further raise its profile on the international stage at a time when it is facing the twin challenges of recession in several of its core European markets and difficulties with air access following Air Seychelles&Otilde; cessation of direct flights to European destinations. &Ograve;We must not forget that tourism is an industry where perceptions play a strong role in molding consumer opinion,&Oacute; stated Alain St. Ange, CEO of the Seychelles&Otilde; Tourism Board, &Ograve;...and Seychelles still suffers from the perception of being an expensive destination and this, at such a time, is not to our advantage. We must continue to do all our in our power to build and maintain an image of Seychelles that reflects the wide choice of accommodation options now on offer and also the fact that Seychelles remains accessible to travelers, despite the cessation of some of Air Seychelles&Otilde; services.&Oacute; The new tourism campaign plays to Seychelles&Otilde; strengths of having a varied basket of accommodation choices for today&Otilde;s visitor, ranging from the pampering comforts of 5-star resorts and the exclusivity of island resorts, to the homely charms of small hotels, Creole guesthouses, and self -catering establishments. &Ograve;Today&Otilde;s accommodation options reflect not only the growing diversity of our product, but also how Seychelles has something to offer for every budget,&Oacute; emphasized St. Ange. The &Ograve;Accessible as never before&Oacute; campaign also advertises the fact that the archipelago remains accessible to travelers through the introduction of two direct, nonstop flights by Air Austral from Paris to Seychelles, effective from March 2012. This will be further reinforced by a service from the Italian Airline, Blue Panorama, commencing on February 14 with one Rome-Milan-Seychelles sector, extending to two flights a week by July 2012. Also, Ethiopian Airlines is expected to commence services to Seychelles through its global network (Africa, Europe, Americas, and the Far East) on April 1, 2012. These services come over and above Seychelles&Otilde; existing partnerships with Emirates (12 flights a week to Seychelles); Qatar (7 flights per week to Seychelles); Etihad (4 flights a week to Seychelles); Condor direct, non-stop from Frankfurt to Seychelles once a week; Kenya Airways twice a week flights to Seychelles with their partnership agreements with KLM and Air France; and Air Seychelles&Otilde; flights to Mauritius and South Africa. &Ograve;Our new stance perfectly echoes the precepts of Seychelles&Otilde; brand of tourism, in which the small, independent operator most definitely has a role to play that can only strengthen Seychelles&Otilde; appeal to a broader spectrum of consumers,&Oacute; added St. Ange. Representatives from Mason's Travel, Seychelles Connect, and Raffles Resort of Praslin joined the Seychelles Tourism Board's delegation at Fitur in Madrid in Spain. The Tourism Board's delegation was headed by Alain St.Ange, and comprised of Bernadette Willemin, the Board's European Director; Monica Gonzalez, the Board's Manager in Spain; Glynn Burridge, the Board's Copy Writer and Consultant; and Ralph Hissen, the Board Manager for International Cooperation. 'Mason's Travel, Seychelles Connect, and Raffles Resort of Praslin joined the Tourism Board's efforts to consolidate the Seychelles market in Spain. They want that business and believe they are prepared for the Spanish Market. We thank them for their support and for being at Fitur 2012,' Alain St.Ange said in Spain. Jan 19, 2012
Loganair Loganair: Norwich to Southampton, Isle of Man. Flybe franchise carrier Loganair will launch service from Norwich to Southampton (weekly, May 19-Oct. 27), and the Isle of Man (weekly, May 26-Sept. 8). Jan 20, 2012
Lufthansa Lufthansa 747 operates first transatlantic biofuel flight to US. Lufthansa has concluded a long-term biofuel study by operating the world&Otilde;s first biofuel-powered transatlantic commercial flight to the US. Flight LH 418 landed at Washington Dulles Jan. 12 after an 8-hr. and 20 min. flight from Frankfurt (FRA). The Boeing 747-400 carried approximately 40 tons of biofuel mix. LH said carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions were reduced by about 38 tons. Captain Rudolf Seebass and flight officer Daniel Rieter commanded the flight and said it was a totally normal revenue flight. Passengers were informed once onboard that biofuel would be used and were given explanatory brochures. &Ograve;They applauded when the announcement was made,&Oacute; Seebass said. Through its burnFAIR project, LH was the first airline to use biofuel on regularly scheduled commercial flights in an effort to study the long-term effect of biofuel on engine maintenance and engine life, as well as the environmental impact. From July 15 to Dec. 27, 2011, a LH Airbus A321 operating on the Hamburg-FRA route had one engine powered by a 50-50 blend of regular fuel and biosynthetic kerosene. In all, 1,187 biofuel flights were conducted and, according to initial calculations, total consumption of the biokerosene mix amounted to 1,556 tons and CO2 emissions were reduced by 1,471 tons. &Ograve;This is the best news we could give the industry because it shows that we really can do normal operations with biofuel,&Oacute; said LH VP-Aviation Biofuel Joachim Buse. He said the transatlantic flight was particularly important because if LH could use biofuels on all US flights, it estimates it could reduce CO2 emissions by about 15,000 tons per week. The airline operates around 400 weekly flights to17 US cities. The biofuel mix used by LH is mostly based on Camelina oil from the US with some Jatropha-based oil from Brazil and some animal fat from Finland. Jan 16, 2012
Lufthansa Lufthansa to balance operations between two Moscow airports. Lufthansa, the largest foreign carrier in Russia, will transfer its Dusseldorf (DUS) and Hamburg (HAM) flights from Moscow Domodedovo (DME) to Moscow Vnukovo (VKO) beginning June 3, according to a VKO statement. In November 2011, Lufthansa revealed plans to add VKO to its network. From March 25, Lufthansa will operate two out of six scheduled daily flights from Frankfurt (FRA), and from June 3 it will add 12 flights per week from Berlin. The carrier had previously said that flights from DUS, HAM and Munich, as well as four frequencies from FRA, would remain at DME. When Lufthansa launches VKO service, it will operate seven daily frequencies from Germany to Moscow to each of the airports. Some FRA and all Munich (MUC) flights are expected to remain in DME. According to Schultz, it is not unusual for German carriers to operate out of two hubs in FRA and MUC. This move could help Russia&Otilde;s third largest carrier, UTair (UT), to become a future Star Alliance member, as Star members are consolidating at VKO. Turkish Airlines (TK) recently announced it will transfer all Moscow flights from Istanbul (IST), Ankara (ANK) and Antalya (AYT) from Sheremetyevo (SVO) and DME to VKO. Jan 16, 2012

Virgin Atlantic, Flybe Government finally taking capacity squeeze seriously - airlines. Airlines have welcomed the government&Otilde;s decision to consult on plans for a new airport on the Thames saying it shows the coalition is finally taking seriously the lack of capacity in the south east. The government confirmed yesterday that it will look at &Ograve;all options&Oacute; for increasing capacity around the London area &ETH; apart from allowing a third runway at Heathrow. This includes formally consulting on plans for a hub airport in the Thames estuary which has been dubbed &Ograve;Boris Island&Oacute;. &Ograve;It is welcome to see the government finally admit that the current capacity problem in the south east cannot be allowed to continue,&Oacute; said Virgin Atlantic in a statement. &Ograve;The UK is becoming hamstrung by our lack of opportunity for growth and risk losing valuable business and tourism to our European competitors.&Oacute; But Virgin added that the government needed to look at possibilities for increasing capacity and not just a Thames estuary airport. &Ograve;The UK needs one strong and viable hub, and the impact on jobs and business of moving this away from west London must be considered,&Oacute; added Virgin. Flybe CEO Jim French said it was &Ograve;entirely appropriate&Oacute; for the government to look at new locations for a hub airport for the UK and admitted that this would have to be in the south-east. &Ograve;The alternative of building a new national airport in another part of the country, away from the South East, is simply not feasible,&Oacute; said French. &Ograve;Just look at the location of every major hub around the world, it is situated adjacent to the major population centre and, in the UK, this is London. &Ograve;So, given the scarce land resource combined with the dense populations in the south east, it seems entirely appropriate that we consider extending our land space through developing an airport in the Thames Estuary.&Oacute; But British Airways and parent company International Airlines Group has continued to oppose the idea of a Thames estuary airport as it would effectively mean the end of Heathrow as the UK&Otilde;s main hub, where IAG will control 53% of slots at Heathrow if its proposed purchase of Bmi is completed. &Ograve;A Thames Estuary hub airport would be an extremely complex project with many technical, operational, environmental and financial hurdles to overcome,&Oacute; said the company in a statement. &Ograve;It has yet to be demonstrated that these issues can be successfully resolved. &Ograve;Opening a new hub would require the closure of Heathrow, which would have profound effects on jobs and business locations in west London, the M4 corridor and the Thames Valley.' Heathrow&Otilde;s owner BAA has also questioned the cost of any new hub airport and said it would be &Ograve;decades away&Oacute; from completion. Jan 19, 2012
Vladivostok Avia, Aeroflot, Rostechnology Vladivostok Avia transfers Moscow flights to Sheremetyevo. Vladivostok Avia (XF) on Feb. 1 will transfer all Moscow flights from Vnukovo (VKO) airport to Sheremetyevo (SVO) Terminal B as a part of its integration strategy with Aeroflot (SU). In November, Russian state corporation Rostechnology completed the asset transfer of five regional carriers to SU. Terminal B is a former base for low-cost carrier Avianova (AO), which stopped operations last year. After the carrier closed, only one airline, Belorussian Belavia Airlines (B2), operated at Terminal B. However, B2 said that from Jan. 25 it will launch flights from Moscow Domodedovo (DME), leaving Terminal 1 empty through Feb. 1. SVO representatives said that Terminal B will eventually be demolished, making way for a new 40-45 million passenger complex. According to airport representatives, construction will begin after a decision is reached on the third runway construction. Jan 19, 2012
