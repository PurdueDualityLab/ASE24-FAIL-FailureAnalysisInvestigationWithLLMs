Airberlin Airberlin Revamps Cabins on Long-Haul Flights. Airberlin has launched the first of its long-haul fleet of A330-200s that have new seats in Business and Economy Class and a new in-flight entertainment system. Business class seats recline 170 degrees. The new economy class seats give more legroom and living space. Additional amenities such as adjustable headrests, coat hooks and pockets for magazines and books are also included. After the upgrade, the Economy Class cabin has 279 seats in total. The on-demand audio-video system provides an individualized entertainment program. The upgrade of all airberlin&Otilde;s long-haul aircraft should be completed by the start of the summer 2012 flight schedule. Airberlin currently offers flights from New York, Miami and Fort Myers, Fla., nonstop to Dusseldorf and Berlin. Starting in May 2012, it will also offer service from Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas and Vancouver, Canada. Jan 19, 2012
Airbus, EASA, Qantas Airways, China Southern Airlines, Singapore Airlines, More cracks found in Airbus A380 wings. Airbus said on Thursday it had discovered more cracks in the wings of two A380 superjumbo aircraft but insisted the world's largest jetliner remained safe to fly. The announcement comes two weeks after tiny cracks were first reported in the wings of the 525-seat, double-decker aircraft, which entered service just over four years ago. 'Airbus confirms that some additional cracks have been found on a limited number of non-critical brackets ... inside the wings of some A380s,' the planemaker said in a statement. 'Airbus emphasizes that these cracks do not affect the safe operation of the aircraft.' The European Aviation Safety Authority (EASA) confirmed it would issue a bulletin Friday mandating precautionary checks. The latest cracking problem was discovered in two aircraft during a routine two-year inspection, an Airbus spokeswoman said. She declined to name the operators of the aircraft. No superjumbos have been grounded but the most heavily used aircraft -- those subjected to at least 1,800 take-offs and landings that impose the most strain on an airframe -- must be examined within four days, authorities said. Airlines operating Airbus SAS (EAD)&Otilde;s A380 superjumbo must ground 20 planes or almost one-third of the world fleet within the next six weeks to check for wing cracks. Carriers with A380s that have accumulated more than 1,300 takeoffs and landings must make the inspections, and any planes that have made more than 1,800 trips need to be checked within four days, the European Aviation Safety Agency said today. Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA), Air France and Emirates will need to take action soonest, based on flight figures, with the work likely to take up to 24 hours, according to the Asian carrier, which said six of its jets require scrutiny in the near term. EASA ordered the checks after the discovery of cracks in one wing led to detection of more serious fractures in other planes. &Ograve;This condition, if not detected and corrected, could potentially affect the structural integrity of the aeroplane,&Oacute; the safety organization said in today&Otilde;s airworthiness directive. &Ograve;The new form of cracking is more significant.&Oacute; The visual examinations don&Otilde;t require special gear and should be completed in a matter of hours, according to Airbus. Singapore Air spokesman Nicholas Ionides said planes could be still be out for a service for as much as a day, though there shouldn&Otilde;t be any impact on operations. Out of its fleet of 15 A380s, another four will need checks within the six-week period. &Ocirc;Reasonably Normal&Otilde; EASA issued its notice after Singapore Air and Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN) found the additional cracks in A380 wing-rib feet. The fissures, while &Ograve;embarrassing,&Oacute; pose no danger to passengers flying on the 68 A380s currently in service, Airbus Chief Executive Officer Tom Enders said late yesterday. The European Aviation Safety Agency acted after European planemaker Airbus disclosed two sets of cracks on its A380s just two weeks apart, and barely four years after the 525-seat double-decker passenger jet entered service. The second type of cracks, which like the first appeared on a bracket joining the exterior to metal ribs inside the wings, was 'more significant' and could develop on other aircraft if the problem is not addressed, the Cologne-based agency said. 'This condition, if not detected and corrected, could potentially affect the structural integrity of the aeroplane,' EASA said in an airworthiness directive issued on Friday. Inspectors ordered checks within six weeks for another category of aircraft with a history of 1,300 to 1,800 cycles. In total, the two-speed recommendations cover 20 aircraft including 10 from Singapore Airlines, seven from Emirates, one from Air France and two test planes, according to a published list of serial numbers at a380production.com. Experts say engineers must carry out visual checks by climbing inside the ribcage of each UK-built wing. The process is expected to take each jet out of service for about 24 hours. Airbus said the order demonstrated the 'airworthiness process is working' and reiterated the aircraft is safe to fly. It has dismissed calls to ground the jets but the Australian engineering union which handles routine servicing and engine checks on superjumbos operated by Qantas Airways said it was concerned about the speed of the planemaker's response. 'They have described these as tiny cracks, but every crack starts off as a tiny crack and they can grow very quickly,' said Stephen Purvinas, federal secretary of the Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association who has called for the grounding. The discovery comes 14 months after a Rolls-Royce engine blowout on a Qantas A380 triggered global headlines. It was during a USD130 million repair job on that same aircraft that hairline cracks in the wing first came to light. Industry sources said the second set of cracks appeared on aircraft operated by Dubai's Emirates, the largest A380 customer. Emirates declined comment but said on Thursday it continued to monitor its fleet and safety was its top priority. EADS subsidiary Airbus has so far delivered 68 superjumbos, starting with Singapore Airlines which took the first aircraft in December 2007, followed by Dubai's Emirates and Qantas Airways of Australia. Other operators include Air France, Germany's Lufthansa, Korean Air and China Southern. The latest problems were discovered in the same type of part as the earlier set of cracks, an L-shaped bracket which connects the wing's exterior to the internal 'rib' structure. A380 wings are manufactured in Broughton, north Wales, and shipped to Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France, for final assembly. Industry journal Air Transport Intelligence said the brackets, known as rib feet, had been stressed during the manufacturing process and that this was being fixed. The A380 -- developed at an estimated cost of 12 billion euros and built in Britain, France, Germany and Spain -- has enough room on its wings to park 70 cars and a wingspan of 79.8m (261ft 10in).

British Airway, Boeing British Airways Flies Newly Refurbished Boeing 777-200. British Airway's customers flying on a recent Boston flight were the first to experience the airline's very latest seats and cabins following the first complete refit of one of BA's Boeing 777-200s. The aircraft was the first of 18 to be fitted with British Airways' recently launched First cabin, new World Traveller and World Traveller Plus cabins and the airline's latest Thales in-flight entertainment system. The multi-million pound refurbishment gives the 18 Boeing 777-200s the same contemporary interiors as British Airways' six brand new Boeing 777-300ERs. Frank van der Post, British Airways' managing director of brands and customer experience, said: 'This exciting and ambitious refit now brings our 777s right up to date, with new interiors and the very latest inflight entertainment system. 'We have had fantastic customer reaction to our new fleet of Boeing 777-300ERs, which originally showcased our new cabins, and we know those who travel on these 18 aircraft will be equally impressed with our investment. 'Customers will be able to enjoy the very best travel experience British Airways has to offer, with more comfortable seats and brighter, more contemporary cabins.' Over the next five years British Airways will be investing more than UKP5bn in new aircraft, smarter cabins, elegant lounges, and new technologies to make life more comfortable in the air and on the ground. It takes British Airways' Cardiff-based engineers, at the airline's Welsh maintenance base, approximately a month, or 5,700 man hours, to carefully remove a 777's old seats and interiors and replace them with the airline's very latest cabins. Each aircraft will also have a staggering 13 kilometres of wiring removed and new fibre optic cables installed to power the new in-flight entertainment system. New widescreens will be fitted in Club World and customers flying on these refitted Boeing 777-200s will also be able to experience the airline's sophisticated new First cabin. New seats and cabins in World Traveller Plus and World Traveller, feature the latest cushioning technology and in-seat power sockets. The Thales in-flight entertainment system offers over 700 hours of movies, TV and music options on demand; that's more than 230 TV programs, 70 films and 400 CDs, providing customers with 50 per cent more choice on movies and doubling the range of TV and music options, as well as plug and play technology. Each cabin also gets bigger, high-resolution widescreens: customers in World Traveller will be able to watch TV and films on 35 per cent larger video touchscreens (now 8.9 inches); in World Traveller Plus they are 60 per cent larger (now 10.6 inches); Club World widescreens increase by 16.3 per cent (now 12.1 inches) while the new First screens increase by 275 per cent (now 15.4 inches) Jan 20, 2012
British Airways British Airways' false alarm causes panic in cabin. British Airways is apologizing to passengers of a trans-Atlantic flight after a recorded message announcing the plane was about to make an emergency landing in the ocean was mistakenly played over the intercom. The incident, which happened on a flight from Miami to London late Friday, caused panic in the cabin. Passengers told British newspapers that about three hours into the journey, a recorded voice suddenly announced: 'This is an emergency, we will shortly be making an emergency landing on water.' In fact, the flight was proceeding normally, but the frightening message led passengers to assume the worst. 'We looked at each other and figured we were both about to die. Families with children were distraught and people were in tears. It was very distressing,' passenger Duncan Farquharson told The Telegraph. 'About 30 seconds later, one of the cabin crew told us to ignore the announcement. ... Imagining yourself plunging towards a cold, watery grave in the middle of the Atlantic is a pretty horrific thought, but they seemed very blas[#x17d] about it.' British Airways isn't saying whether a technical glitch or human error caused the recording to play. 'The cabin crew canceled the announcement immediately and reassured customers that the flight was operating normally,' the airline said in a statement. 'We apologized to customers for causing them undue concern.' The plane landed safely at its destination. Jan 18, 2012
Brussels Airlines Brussels Airlines upgrades widebody fleet interiors. Brussels Airlines will invest EUR30 million (USD38.3 million) to revamp the interiors of its widebody fleet, comprising five Airbus A330-300 and two -200s. Business class will be fitted with full-flat beds with built-in LED mood lighting; economy seats will be equipped with the IMS Company&Otilde;s innovative seat-centric RAVE inflight entertainment system. The Brussels-based carrier, in which Lufthansa holds 45%, has six A330s with the seventh, a -200 arriving in a couple of months. The first refurnished aircraft will be placed into service from spring, and by year end all seven aircraft will be fitted with the new seats, lavatories and galleys. Brussels Airlines&Otilde;s new daily scheduled services to New York JFK operate with the new inflight product and the upgrade will be gradually available on the African network. Lufthansa Technik Malta will perform the interior retrofits. Management considered introducing a mid-tier cabin but decided to stick to its current business class/economy class configuration &Ograve;as this corresponds better to the demands of our markets. Besides, not one carrier in the Lufthansa Group offers a premium-economy product,&Oacute; VP Communications Geert Sciot said. The A330-30 will have 30 seats in business class and 248 in economy class; 24 of the 30 business-class seats will have direct aisle access and 10 will have no adjacent seat. Jan 16, 2012

Lufthansa Lufthansa 747 operates first transatlantic biofuel flight to US. Lufthansa has concluded a long-term biofuel study by operating the world&Otilde;s first biofuel-powered transatlantic commercial flight to the US. Flight LH 418 landed at Washington Dulles Jan. 12 after an 8-hr. and 20 min. flight from Frankfurt (FRA). The Boeing 747-400 carried approximately 40 tons of biofuel mix. LH said carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions were reduced by about 38 tons. Captain Rudolf Seebass and flight officer Daniel Rieter commanded the flight and said it was a totally normal revenue flight. Passengers were informed once onboard that biofuel would be used and were given explanatory brochures. &Ograve;They applauded when the announcement was made,&Oacute; Seebass said. Through its burnFAIR project, LH was the first airline to use biofuel on regularly scheduled commercial flights in an effort to study the long-term effect of biofuel on engine maintenance and engine life, as well as the environmental impact. From July 15 to Dec. 27, 2011, a LH Airbus A321 operating on the Hamburg-FRA route had one engine powered by a 50-50 blend of regular fuel and biosynthetic kerosene. In all, 1,187 biofuel flights were conducted and, according to initial calculations, total consumption of the biokerosene mix amounted to 1,556 tons and CO2 emissions were reduced by 1,471 tons. &Ograve;This is the best news we could give the industry because it shows that we really can do normal operations with biofuel,&Oacute; said LH VP-Aviation Biofuel Joachim Buse. He said the transatlantic flight was particularly important because if LH could use biofuels on all US flights, it estimates it could reduce CO2 emissions by about 15,000 tons per week. The airline operates around 400 weekly flights to17 US cities. The biofuel mix used by LH is mostly based on Camelina oil from the US with some Jatropha-based oil from Brazil and some animal fat from Finland. Jan 16, 2012
Ryanair Ryanair to create 1,000 new jobs. Ryanair is set to create 1,000 new jobs this year as the airline expands its fleet by 35 aircraft after adding five new bases in 2012. The no-frills carrier is creating a base at Manchester this year alongside Billund in Denmark, Wroclaw in Poland, Palma on Majorca and the Cypriot city of Paphos. Ryanair said it expected passenger numbers to rise by 5% this year to 80 million from last year&Otilde;s 76 million as its fleet will grow from 270 to 305 aircraft. The company is looking to recruit pilots, cabin crew, engineers as well as sales and marketing staff. The airline used the announcement to take another swipe at the Irish government - accusing authorities of charging high fees at its airports and criticised the country&Otilde;s air passenger tax of EUR3. Ryanair spokesman Stephen McNamara said: &Ograve;Ryanair believes that Ireland can return to strong traffic, tourism and jobs growth, but only when the new government delivers on its promise to scrap the tourist tax, reduce the Dublin Airport Authority's high airport charges to competitive levels, to put Ireland back in the market as a low cost tourist destination, and end the failed policy of protecting the high cost, traffic declining DAA airport monopoly.&Oacute; Jan 18, 2012
