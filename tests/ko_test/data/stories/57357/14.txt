An equipment-laden barge approached the half-submerged Costa Concordia yesterday to begin removing about 500,000 gallons of oil from the cruise ship before it seeps into the Tuscan sea.
Fuel extraction from Miami-based Carnival Corp.'s cruise liner will begin Saturday. Until that time, crews from the Dutch shipwreck company Smit International will work on the ship's bow, and divers will determine the precise locations of the vessel's fuel tanks.
Officials so far have identified six fuel tanks that need to be drilled and vacuumed to remove oil. Those six tanks are estimated to hold about 50 percent of the ship's fuel. Pumping is expected to continue for 24 hours a day, barring inclement weather or technical glitches.
'At this stage we don't see a big risk in an oil spill, but if weather deteriorates nobody can tell what the vessel will do,' said Bart Huizing, head of operations at Smit.
The crew aboard the Meloria barge will also be tasked with locating missing bodies.
Since they began working yesterday, crews have discovered one body on the ship, bringing the death toll to 16. Seven of the recovered bodies remain unidentified and are believed to account for some of the 17 passengers and crew members still missing.
Workers are racing against the clock to prevent the oil and other debris from spreading too far into the pristine sea around Giglio, Italy, where the ship toppled after veering off course. Giglio and its waters are part of a protected seven-island marine park, which contains porpoises, dolphins, whales and other sea creatures.
On Monday, local residents and officials spotted an oil slick about 300 yards from the cruise ship. Tests conducted yesterday showed the slick was not significantly toxic.
In the wake of the shipwreck, Italy's Environment Minister Corrado Clini has proposed limiting access of large cruise ships in the shallow waters of Venice, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
'In the meantime, it will be up to the port authority and to the city to decide which traffic is sustainable and compatible with Venice's particular situation,' he said yesterday during a public appearance in northern Italy (Paolocci/Winfield, AP/New Orleans Times-Picayune, Jan. 24). -- PK
