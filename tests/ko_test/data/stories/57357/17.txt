British Airway, Boeing British Airways Flies Newly Refurbished Boeing 777-200. British Airway's customers flying on a recent Boston flight were the first to experience the airline's very latest seats and cabins following the first complete refit of one of BA's Boeing 777-200s. The aircraft was the first of 18 to be fitted with British Airways' recently launched First cabin, new World Traveller and World Traveller Plus cabins and the airline's latest Thales in-flight entertainment system. The multi-million pound refurbishment gives the 18 Boeing 777-200s the same contemporary interiors as British Airways' six brand new Boeing 777-300ERs. Frank van der Post, British Airways' managing director of brands and customer experience, said: 'This exciting and ambitious refit now brings our 777s right up to date, with new interiors and the very latest inflight entertainment system. 'We have had fantastic customer reaction to our new fleet of Boeing 777-300ERs, which originally showcased our new cabins, and we know those who travel on these 18 aircraft will be equally impressed with our investment. 'Customers will be able to enjoy the very best travel experience British Airways has to offer, with more comfortable seats and brighter, more contemporary cabins.' Over the next five years British Airways will be investing more than UKP5bn in new aircraft, smarter cabins, elegant lounges, and new technologies to make life more comfortable in the air and on the ground. It takes British Airways' Cardiff-based engineers, at the airline's Welsh maintenance base, approximately a month, or 5,700 man hours, to carefully remove a 777's old seats and interiors and replace them with the airline's very latest cabins. Each aircraft will also have a staggering 13 kilometres of wiring removed and new fibre optic cables installed to power the new in-flight entertainment system. New widescreens will be fitted in Club World and customers flying on these refitted Boeing 777-200s will also be able to experience the airline's sophisticated new First cabin. New seats and cabins in World Traveller Plus and World Traveller, feature the latest cushioning technology and in-seat power sockets. The Thales in-flight entertainment system offers over 700 hours of movies, TV and music options on demand; that's more than 230 TV programs, 70 films and 400 CDs, providing customers with 50 per cent more choice on movies and doubling the range of TV and music options, as well as plug and play technology. Each cabin also gets bigger, high-resolution widescreens: customers in World Traveller will be able to watch TV and films on 35 per cent larger video touchscreens (now 8.9 inches); in World Traveller Plus they are 60 per cent larger (now 10.6 inches); Club World widescreens increase by 16.3 per cent (now 12.1 inches) while the new First screens increase by 275 per cent (now 15.4 inches) Jan 20, 2012
British Airways British Airways' false alarm causes panic in cabin. British Airways is apologizing to passengers of a trans-Atlantic flight after a recorded message announcing the plane was about to make an emergency landing in the ocean was mistakenly played over the intercom. The incident, which happened on a flight from Miami to London late Friday, caused panic in the cabin. Passengers told British newspapers that about three hours into the journey, a recorded voice suddenly announced: 'This is an emergency, we will shortly be making an emergency landing on water.' In fact, the flight was proceeding normally, but the frightening message led passengers to assume the worst. 'We looked at each other and figured we were both about to die. Families with children were distraught and people were in tears. It was very distressing,' passenger Duncan Farquharson told The Telegraph. 'About 30 seconds later, one of the cabin crew told us to ignore the announcement. ... Imagining yourself plunging towards a cold, watery grave in the middle of the Atlantic is a pretty horrific thought, but they seemed very blas[#x17d] about it.' British Airways isn't saying whether a technical glitch or human error caused the recording to play. 'The cabin crew canceled the announcement immediately and reassured customers that the flight was operating normally,' the airline said in a statement. 'We apologized to customers for causing them undue concern.' The plane landed safely at its destination. Jan 18, 2012

Business class will be fitted with full-flat beds with built-in LED mood lighting; economy seats will be equipped with the IMS Company&Otilde;s innovative seat-centric RAVE inflight entertainment system.

Brussels Airlines&Otilde;s new daily scheduled services to New York JFK operate with the new inflight product and the upgrade will be gradually available on the African network. Lufthansa Technik Malta will perform the interior retrofits. Management considered introducing a mid-tier cabin but decided to stick to its current business class/economy class configuration &Ograve;as this corresponds better to the demands of our markets. Besides, not one carrier in the Lufthansa Group offers a premium-economy product,&Oacute; VP Communications Geert Sciot said. The A330-30 will have 30 seats in business class and 248 in economy class; 24 of the 30 business-class seats will have direct aisle access and 10 will have no adjacent seat. Jan 16, 2012

Lufthansa Lufthansa 747 operates first transatlantic biofuel flight to US. Lufthansa has concluded a long-term biofuel study by operating the world&Otilde;s first biofuel-powered transatlantic commercial flight to the US. Flight LH 418 landed at Washington Dulles Jan. 12 after an 8-hr. and 20 min. flight from Frankfurt (FRA). The Boeing 747-400 carried approximately 40 tons of biofuel mix. LH said carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions were reduced by about 38 tons. Captain Rudolf Seebass and flight officer Daniel Rieter commanded the flight and said it was a totally normal revenue flight. Passengers were informed once onboard that biofuel would be used and were given explanatory brochures. &Ograve;They applauded when the announcement was made,&Oacute; Seebass said. Through its burnFAIR project, LH was the first airline to use biofuel on regularly scheduled commercial flights in an effort to study the long-term effect of biofuel on engine maintenance and engine life, as well as the environmental impact. From July 15 to Dec. 27, 2011, a LH Airbus A321 operating on the Hamburg-FRA route had one engine powered by a 50-50 blend of regular fuel and biosynthetic kerosene. In all, 1,187 biofuel flights were conducted and, according to initial calculations, total consumption of the biokerosene mix amounted to 1,556 tons and CO2 emissions were reduced by 1,471 tons. &Ograve;This is the best news we could give the industry because it shows that we really can do normal operations with biofuel,&Oacute; said LH VP-Aviation Biofuel Joachim Buse. He said the transatlantic flight was particularly important because if LH could use biofuels on all US flights, it estimates it could reduce CO2 emissions by about 15,000 tons per week. The airline operates around 400 weekly flights to17 US cities. The biofuel mix used by LH is mostly based on Camelina oil from the US with some Jatropha-based oil from Brazil and some animal fat from Finland. Jan 16, 2012
