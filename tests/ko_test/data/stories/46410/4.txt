Technical glitches force delay of Mars mission; Launch of science rover slips to 2011

NASA Administrator Mike Griffin announced Thursday that the costly Mars Science Laboratory will be delayed for two years.
The setback to 2011 will add $400 million to the spacecraft's cost, raising its total price to as much as $2.3 billion.
'We see too much risk for a flagship mission,' Griffin said at a briefing in Washington, D.C. He cited unexpected difficulties that NASA is having with the manufacture and control of 31 'actuator' gearbox motors aboard the subcompact-size rover.
The announcement comes less than two weeks after the agency was publicly criticized for lavish spending. A former NASA official, planetary scientist S. Alan Stern, cited Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) costs in criticizing the agency's 'routine acquiescence to immense cost increases in projects.' Stern's remarks appeared Nov. 23 in The New York Times.
Griffin made a reference to the criticism at the briefing, saying that technical difficulties, not budget issues, forced the delay. 'I never thought of cancelling the mission,' Griffin said.
Earth and Mars have to be at specific points in their respective orbits for a spacecraft to successfully traverse the distance between them. This 'orbital window' opens every 26 months, leaving too little time for MSL engineers to correct the actuator problems next year, said NASA's Doug McCuistion, head of the Mars exploration office.
The next launch window opens in 2011, from November to December, he said, with the exact launch date determined once NASA engineers have chosen the landing site on the Martian surface.
After a parachute landing, the 9-foot-long mobile craft would roam the Martian equator, collecting and crushing rock samples for oven analysis over the course of one Martian year, 687 days. It will be looking for chemical precursors to life.
'No one wants a $2 billion hole in the ground instead of a successful mission,' said planetary scientist John Mustard of Brown University in Providence, R.I., who heads NASA's Mars program advisory panel. But 'this is going to have ripple effects in the science community,' he added, noting that NASA had already cut Mars office funding about 50% from previous years, down to about $300 million.
The extra $400 million, spread over 2011 to 2014, will come from other Mars missions and perhaps other planetary explorations, NASA's Ed Weiler said at the briefing. NASA will consult with planetary scientists on their priorities before it shifts money from other programs, such as a 2013 'scout' mission to Mars.
MSL is 'a marvelous mission, it will do wonderful things. But at what cost?' said Keith Cowing, editor of the NASA Watch website. 'And how often do we have to watch cost overruns on these NASA missions where projects get too big to cancel?'
Weiler said that NASA will begin collaborating with the European Space Agency on all future Mars missions.
