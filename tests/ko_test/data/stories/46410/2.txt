NASA delays Mars science-lab launch 2 years to fix glitches

Dec. 5--WASHINGTON
The long-anticipated launch of NASA's Mars Science Laboratory -- intended to determine whether ancient Mars supported microbial life -- has been delayed an additional two years until the fall of 2011.
The delay will add about $400 million to the cost of the mission, now estimated at $2.3 billion. The original estimate in August 2006 was $1.63 billion.
NASA officials said Thursday that an October 2009 launch date is no longer feasible because of hardware and testing problems. Because of planetary alignments, launch windows open only every 26 months, forcing a wait until 2011.
The delay is caused by technical problems with actuators -- small motors that will drive the rover's six wheels and move the joints of the lab's robotic arm.
NASA said it would have cost $200 million to try to speed up development of the lab and fix the problem to make the 2009 window, but managers decided there was not enough time.
"We will not lessen our standards for testing the mission's complex flight systems, so we are choosing the more responsible option of changing the launch date," said Doug McCuistion, director of the Mars Exploration Program.
"We've reached the point where we cannot condense the schedule further without compromising vital testing."
The Mars Science Laboratory has been blasted by critics for being years behind schedule and well over budget. Team members were defensive in describing the reasons for further delay, which came after a three-month review of the project.
"Costs and schedules are taken very seriously on any science mission," said Ed Weiler, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. "However, when it's all said and done, the passing grade is mission success."
The advanced rover is one of the most technologically challenging missions ever designed. It will use new technologies to adjust its flight through the Martian atmosphere, and to lower the rover to the surface via a tether from a hovering descent stage. The laboratory will use a new surface propulsion system to drive longer distances over rougher terrain than previous rovers.
