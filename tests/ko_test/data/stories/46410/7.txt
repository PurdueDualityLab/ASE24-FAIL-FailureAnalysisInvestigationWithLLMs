Technical glitches have forced US space agency NASA to delay the launch of a landmark mission to Mars, which was due to lift off in the the northern autumn of next year, officials said.
'We will not be ready to launch Mars Science Lab by the hoped-for date next year,' NASA administrator Michael Griffin told a news conference.
'Because of a number of factors that need to be addressed, we are slipping the launch to 2011,' he said.
The delay from the scheduled launch will add around $US400 million to the already over-budget Mars Science Lab project, which aims to assess whether microbial life ever existed on the red planet and still exists now.
