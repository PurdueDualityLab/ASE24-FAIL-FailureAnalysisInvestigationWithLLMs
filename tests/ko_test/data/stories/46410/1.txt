A good year for Mars

Sky-watchers currently have a pretty good selection of planets to view in our nighttime skies.
Earlier this week we had the dazzling conjunction between Venus and Jupiter, and although Jupiter is now sinking closer to the horizon each night Venus is climbing higher and will continue to shine brilliantly in our evening sky for the next several months.
Saturn rises in the east shortly after midnight and is high in our eastern sky during the hours before dawn, and meanwhile Mercury isn't presently visible but will start appearing in our dusk sky within a couple of weeks and will have a nice conjunction with Jupiter around New Year's Eve.
The one bright planet that isn't visible right now is our (usually) close neighbor, Mars. After being a part of our nighttime sky for the past two years and making a moderately close approach to our planet a year ago at this time, Mars disappeared into evening twilight a few weeks ago and this week is passing on the far side of the sun from Earth.
The coronagraphs aboard the SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft are about the only instruments currently capable of detecting it.
But while Mars itself is hidden from view for the time being, it has certainly been the scene of some fascinating findings over the past many months. The highlight of this has undoubtedly been the Phoenix mission, which touched down in Mars' north polar region this past May.
For the next several months, Phoenix scraped and dug at the polar Martian soil, and verified the presence of large deposits of water ice underneath that soil. Phoenix also detected the presence of various salts in the polar soil, and although the properties of the soil prevented an easy analysis of the underlying ice, continued analysis may hopefully reveal whether or not any organic (i.e., carbon-containing) material resides within that ice.
We knew that Phoenix's days would be numbered as autumn began descending onto Mars' northern hemisphere. An unusually heavy dust storm in October prevented Phoenix's solar panels from collecting necessary energy from the already-decreasing sunlight, and the last signals were received in early November.
It is unlikely to survive the approaching Martian winter (where temperatures are expected to drop to minus 240 degrees F), as it will probably become encased in ice (most likely carbon dioxide ice, or 'dry' ice) and the fragile solar panels that aren't designed to handle that much weight crack and break off.
Still, we got a good five months of data from Phoenix, and when all is said and done we should know a lot more about the conditions for possible life on the Red Planet.
Phoenix hasn't been the only spacecraft that has been examining our neighboring world lately. The twin rovers Spirit and Opportunity, which landed upon Mars' surface in early 2004 - and which were designed to operate for three months - are still going strong almost five years later, although they're (not surprisingly) starting to experience a few technological glitches as they age.
Opportunity, in particular, recently finished a year-long study of a half-mile wide crater called Victoria (and even descended into the crater for a while), and now has begun an even bigger challenge: a seven-mile journey to a much larger crater called Endeavour (14 miles across and 1,000 feet deep).
It will take Opportunity almost two years to get there, and if it is still functioning after that time we should have some more fascinating data and images to analyze and study. In addition to the landers and rovers, three orbiting spacecraft are still functioning: NASA's Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Observer (MRO) missions, and the European Space Agency's Mars Express mission.
Recent data from Odyssey suggests that a large ocean may have once covered as much as a third of Mars' surface (mainly in the northern hemisphere), and meanwhile data from MRO indicates the presence of what appear to be very large glaciers underlying regions of the present Martian surface.
These apparent glaciers lie near a Martian latitude of 45 degrees south - much closer to the Equator than anyone had previously thought possible. Mars begins to re-emerge into the morning sky in early 2009, although it does so gradually and it will probably be April or May before it will be easily visible.
It will be then be making another long sojourn through our nighttime skies, being closest to Earth (and thus brightest and best visible) in early 2010. And, another spacecraft will also soon be on its way to the Red Planet: NASA's Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission, currently scheduled for launch in early October 2009.
MSL is a rover mission, similar to Spirit and Opportunity but much larger - the size of a small automobile, in fact. It is planned to touch down upon Mars' surface in mid-2010 at a site that is hopefully conducive to studies of possible past Martian life; four potential sites are currently being evaluated, and a final decision is expected to be made about next April. So, while Mars is currently making an exit and is giving its other planetary brethren a chance to shine in our skies, it will be back - and again will give us food for thought and contemplation as we find our way through this universe.
