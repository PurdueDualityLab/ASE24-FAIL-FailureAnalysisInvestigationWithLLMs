New Delhi, May 20 -- Highpower demand, a supply mismatch and local faults combined to make life miserable for Delhiites. Power cuts of varied lengths were the norm on Thursday, even as Delhi government asked discoms to arrange more power to tide over the crisis.
Delhi power ministerHaroon Yusuf held a meeting with chief executives of the three discoms and asked them to arrange for additional power immediately. He also asked them to strengthen their distribution network, which is prone to faults and breakdowns. "The government would approach the centre for some more power," he said.
The 210 MW unit of National Thermal Power Corporation(NTPC) Dadri, which went kaput on Wednesday, is expected to resume supply on Friday, even as a gas turbine in Dadri is being fixed. The Jhajjar plant, whose 500 MW generation has been hit thanks to a technical glitch, will take 10 more days to resume functioning. Delhi gets around 240 MW from here.
Delhi surpassed lastyear's highest peak demand to reach 4,785 MW - last year's high, in July, was 4,720 - sending discoms scurrying to meet the load.
"We expect this kind ofdemand in late June and July, as was the pattern till last year. This year, we have seen a 23% increase in demand in the past 18 days, which is unusual for May," said Ramesh Narayanan, CEO, BSES Yamuna Power Limited.
Mayur Vihar Pocket 1residents had a harrowing time, early on Thursday, as an electric feeder tripped around 4am. "There was no power from 3am to 7.30am. And then again from 8.30am till late," said Arun Kumar, a resident of Mayur Vihar Pocket 1.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.
