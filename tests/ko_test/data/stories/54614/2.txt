NEW DELHI: Power cuts continued to plague many parts of the city as the electricity demand remained a high 4785 MW. Residents of colonies like Mayur Vihar, Ashok Vihar, Dwarka and Malviya Nagar said that disruptions in power supply lasted an hour or two in the peak morning and evening hours.
Discoms said power demand was higher than what was recorded last year at the same time. With reduction in power availability from stations like Jhajjar and Dadri, there have been some glitches in meeting the load during peak hours. The situation is expected to get better in the coming days when the closed units of these stations resume generation. Damodar Valley Corporation is supplying up to 95 MW power. The power demand this entire week has hovered between 4750 MW to 4800 MW. The highest demand was recorded on Wednesday which discoms report was 23% higher than what was recorded last year in the corresponding period.
Affected residents complained that the discom snaps supply just when they need it the most. Call centre helplines were without any information most of the time. "There are more weeks of sweltering heat to follow as the worst summer month of June is yet to come. Reassurances of Delhi becoming free of power cuts have always proved false. It's the same story every year,'' said an agitated resident of Dwarka. The area went without power for two hours in the morning.
