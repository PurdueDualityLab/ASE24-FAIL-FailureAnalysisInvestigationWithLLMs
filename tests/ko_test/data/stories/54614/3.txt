THE CLAIMS of chief minister Sheila Dikshit that power- surplus Delhi is ready to meet a peak demand of 5,100Mw fell flat on Wednesday. A record- breaking demand caused ' technical glitches' on the national grid resulting in shortage and power outages across the Capital.
The demand for power touched 4,823Mw on Wednesday, while the previous highest was 4,720Mw on July 1, 2010. Several areas across north, south and west Delhi faced rotational power cuts for 30 to 120 minutes because of overload and subsequent snags in the northern grid. The main affected areas were in south and west Delhi such as Saket, Malviya Nagar, Dwarka, Janakpuri and Vikaspuri.
This happened on a day when power minister Haroon Yusuf met the top brass to review the power situation. After the meeting, Yusuf blamed these outages on ' snags in NTPC's Dadri and Jhajjar plants, which resulted in a shortfall of over 460Mw'. He said the supply of 210Mw at NTPC Dadri's plant would be restored by late Wednesday night while the Jhajjar plant would take a week to function at its 250Mw- level. Yusuf also said that private discoms ' should improve their functioning as power cuts happened in several areas because of local faults.' The discoms, meanwhile, presented a scarier picture, saying things would get worse before turning better. The companies said they had expected Delhi's demand to peak after mid- July, by when monsoon would have made hydro- electric power plants fully functional.
' But given the present rate of increase, it seems that the demand may peak in May itself, much before the hydro- electric plants become functional - and hence it will be difficult to meet the demand. When the demand peaked on Wednesday, huge holes were exposed in the gov- There was shortfall of 460Mw on Wednesday By Bhuvan Bagga in New Delhi ernment's claim of self- sufficiency,' Ramesh Narayanan, CEO of BSES Yamuna, said.
While Yusuf and other government officials promised restoration of normalcy, the national Capital registered a shortfall of around 450Mw on Wednesday afternoon.
The power companies had expected a monthly increase 10 per cent in power consumption during the summer, but the demand surged by 23 per cent between May 1 and 18. It was 3,863Mw at the start of the month and climbed to 4,823Mw by Wednesday afternoon.
