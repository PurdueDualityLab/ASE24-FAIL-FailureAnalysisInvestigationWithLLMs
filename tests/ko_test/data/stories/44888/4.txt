City Wants Judge to Seal Lottery Bid; Attorney General Cites Sensitivity of Company Secrets

The office of the D.C. attorney general asked an administrative judge yesterday to seal records in the fight over the contract to run the D.C. Lottery, a deal that could be worth $120 million.
Last month, Lottery Technology Enterprises, which has operated the lottery for 25 years, filed a formal complaint with the Contract Appeals Board to challenge the District's choice of W2I Ventures to take over the gaming system next year.
The District responded yesterday with the request for a protective order, mainly to guard proprietary products of W2I's winning contract proposal, interim Attorney General Peter Nickles said.
Nickles called the request 'standard.'
'The papers contain some . . . commercial and trade secrets,' he said. 'By tomorrow or the next day, we'll determine what parts will be public.'
The proposed contract, which must be approved by the D.C. Council, has been a volatile issue over the past month; LTE is accusing the city of showing favoritism toward W2I.
The council tabled the proposal at a meeting last week, but Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) resubmitted it the next day, giving the council 45 more days to take action.
LTE is a joint venture of locally owned New Tech Games and international gaming powerhouse GTech. City officials have criticized the company for antiquated equipment, glitches and a security breach that produced fake tickets worth $70,000 in 2006.
W2I is a partnership between locally owned W2Tech and Intralot, GTech's international rival. W2I is a 10-month-old company.
Although W2Tech is new, the family of husband and wife owners Alaka and Warren Williams Jr. is not new to doing business with the city.
Williams and his father owned a nightclub that leased space in the Frank D. Reeves Municipal Center and was closed after a patron was fatally stabbed in 2005. Also, the younger Williams has been accused of being a neglectful landlord.
The two-page order is followed by a page for signatures from attorneys for the city, W2I and LTE.
Under the agreement, if approved by the judge, documents would be limited to the parties involved.
According to LTE's initial April 4 protest, the company supports a protective order regarding proprietary information. But it wanted the city to provide it with all worksheets, summaries and other documents related to the best and final offers of both companies. It also requested the names of the panel that picked the winner.
LTE wants a hearing before Jonathan D. Zischkau, chief administrative judge for the appeals board, before signing any document that will restrict any parts of the contract from public view, said Ann Walker Marchant, a spokeswoman for LTE and daughter of New Tech Games partner George Walker.
'We think the protective order is way too broad,' she said. 'There should be transparency in the procurement process.'
The company fears that other parts of the document that have nothing to do with trade secrets will be hidden, Marchant said. LTE saw some documents in the bidding and award process for the first time yesterday, she said, declining to go into detail until Zischkau announces a decision.
