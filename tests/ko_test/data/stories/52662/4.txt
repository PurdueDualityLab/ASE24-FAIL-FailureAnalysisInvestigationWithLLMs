LORD SUGAR has stepped up his online feud with TV presenter Kirstie Allsopp with a below-the-belt comment telling her to lose weight.
The Apprentice guru said she should consider "a diet" after he saw a clip of the Channel 4 property presenter.
His remarks on the Twitter website came T after Allsopp took him to task for posting during yesterday's two-minute silence. Lord Sugar blamed the message on a technical glitch.
