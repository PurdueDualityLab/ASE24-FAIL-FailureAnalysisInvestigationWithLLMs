LORD Sugar last night continued his feud with TV presenter Kirstie Allsopp by telling her to lose weight.
His comment came after it appeared the boss of The Apprentice had posted on Twitter during yesterday's two-minute silence for Armistice Day.
He had told followers "no tweeting for two minutes" shortly before the silence. But he posted two messages, which appeared at 11.01am and 11.02am, about how many followers he had. He hastily put the mishap down to a technical "glitch".
But Miss Allsopp, 39, who co-hosts property show Location, Location, Location, spotted the remarks and wrote: "Using the two-minute silence to plug your book? That's unforgivable by anyone's standards!"
Lord Sugar reiterated his "glitch" claim and responded that having seen a clip of her TV show "she really needs to think about a diet". He also drew attention to an expletive on her Twitter account and asked: "Did you pick that language up at Roedean Darling lovie?"
She later tweeted denying she wrote the comment, claiming someone sent it from her account. Other Twitter users also blasted Lord Sugar, with one saying: "Alan Sugar should have his lordship and knighthood revoked for being an a**."
Defending himself, Lord Sugar tweeted: "Why would I tweet at 10.59 'no tweets for 2 mins' and then tweet straight after, obviously a tech glitch looking into." The 63-year-old's spokesman said last night: "He is very upset at the suggestion that he would not observe the two-minute silence or disrespect it. The tweets express-25x4-amended&sent 13/ were not sent during the silence, they just appear to have been sent during it."
Problems between the pair erupted a month ago after they worked on a celebrity version of his BBC show and she called his behaviour "shockingly uncharitable".
She later added: "There r words I don't use, but when it comes to Sugar & his treatment of the staff & crew involved... in any other work place he'd be Fired!!"
Lord Sugar later called Miss Allsopp the "worst contestant on celeb apprentice ever".
