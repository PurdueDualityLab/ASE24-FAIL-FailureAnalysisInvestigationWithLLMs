LORD Sugar has stepped up his online feud with TV presenter Kirstie Allsopp with a comment telling her to lose weight.
The straight-talking Apprentice guru said Allsopp should consider “a diet” .
The exchange is the latest in a lengthy to-and-fro between the pair on micro-blogging site Twitter.
The latest episode began when Lord Sugar reminded his followers to observe the two-minute silence yesterday morning. Another Tweet followed shortly afterward, which he blamed on a technical glitch.
However, Allsopp spotted the remark and wrote: “Using the 2 minutes silence to plug your book? That’s unforgivable by anyones standards!”
Lord Sugar responded that having seen a “clip of her TV show, she really needs to think about a diet”.
Allsopp later denied she had posted the comment about Lord Sugar and said her account had been targeted by a hacker.
