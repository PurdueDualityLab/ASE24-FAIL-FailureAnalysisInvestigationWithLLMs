Strive we must; A hundred years on, we have perspective -and much to navigate

March 8 marks the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day, which began amidst the efforts of millions of Western women to work, vote, hold public office and end discrimination. On this occasion, the National Post has asked its contributors to evaluate the state of feminism and women's rights in 2011.
When I was a teenager, my parents flew us across Canada. I had a window seat and the day was clear. The school year had just concluded - and with it, Grade 9 Geography, in which I had not fared so well. Tarns, glaciation, mesa and archipelago: A lexicon of geographic definitions that had eluded my comprehension were now arrayed below me. At 33,000 feet, I could finally see it all so clearly. Geography made perfect sense from up here: The way the mountains gave way to the prairies; the way an old river meandered where a new river coursed. If only I could write the exam again. Perspective changes everything.
Fast forward to today. I am single. I have kids, or more accurately, young adults. My young adults are ready to be released from captivity.
At last, I have perspective. Metaphorically speaking, I have achieved 33,000 feet of altitude. And finally, I get it. Men. Women. Babies. Jobs.
In recent years I've grown three inches from all the smacking I've done to my forehead. I want to run through the streets hollering, "I have found it!" But who will listen? Women will nod knowingly; they will testify to the timeless truth and hard-won knowledge. But girls won't. If they did, life as we know it would be forever changed. After all, the world needs these fecund disbelievers. All hail the Kardashians.
So, how did I miss the big picture? I didn't see it because I wasn't supposed to. I didn't see it because I was the standardissue, hormone-fuelled, compliant, distracted, short-sighted female, hot and bothered by Mother Nature's Big Plan for me. We were pretty certain that the problems of the previous generation of women were faults of mismanagement. We were handling things better. We were savvier. We were more worldly. We were wrong.
Which brings us to International Women's Day. Yes, that hallowed of occasions when we drop to one knee and a grateful planet gives thanks for the role that women play and to those who have improved our lot in life.
There is a traditional dinner, a day off from work, special attire -oh! the funny sweaters! -and we go to the mall and have our picture taken sitting on Susan B. Anthony's knee.
Not so much. International Women's Day will pass with a few wan, civic acknowledgements, a proletarian luncheon somewhere and some newsreel footage of some feisty Victorians. But it exists and we should be damn glad it does. It's a start. Even now: It's a start.
International Women's Day exists because, over the last hundred years, a few among us, having finally achieved altitude, attempt to share perspective with those of us still on the ground.
I am going to share with you the advice I gave my daughter. If you are under a certain age, this will make you groan. If you are over a certain age, the reflex of righteousness will make you nod like a bobblehead.
Here it is:
One egg; a zillion sperm. Which is more valuable? Hint: We value diamonds more highly than sand. Why do you suppose women are entrusted with the holiest of holies, the egg? Because we will take care of that egg for decades. What's more, we will care for the eggs of that egg. To men, we give confetti. Go! Amuse yourselves. Spread your confetti around the town -the world, even. Stir the primeval pot.
But to women we say: Guard the egg. And be home by 11.
Now, what is it that you have to say about equality in the face of this foundational incongruence? This is a perennial bugaboo in the equality argument. And it rears its ugly, ovoid head in every arena. And I do mean every. Even now, in 2011.
I have a friend who has the type of job that sees her riding around nations' capitals in big, black cars with small flags on the front. Her job requires her to lunch with the likes of Nick, Angela, and David ... as in Sarkozy, Merkel and Cameron. She's a kick-ass heavy-hitter, a regular poster girl for International Women's Day. Here is what she has to say about gender and the workplace: To ignore the role sex plays in any situation is to set yourself up for failure. Failure and derision and exclusion.
As she recounts her stories of subtext and power plays, distant voices surface in my mind. I hear John Crosbie telling fellow politician Shelia Copps, "Just quiet down, baby," and then, "Pass the tequila, Sheila, lay down and love me again." I hear the Winnipeg judge who just the other week handed down a lenient ruling in a rape case because, he said, "sex was in the air." Sex.
Sex is heavenly. It is also treachery. It will bring you to heel, on that you can depend. Now, remember: I am just a woman tying to keep her tank full and cover her Costco bill. I am not the final authority. Then again, neither are you. There is no final authority.
Except for Walt Whitman. Him, we should listen to. More than 100 years ago, he weighed in on women, men and egalitarianism. His poem, A Woman Waits for Me, speaks of equality and authenticity and of how even our judicial system is informed not by gender, but sex outright:
All the governments, judges, gods and follow'd persons of the earth, These are contain'd in sex as parts of itself and justification of itself.
I stumbled upon this poem because I make it my purpose to stumble upon poems.
Drink this in:
They are not one jot less than I am. They are tann'd in the face by shining suns and blowing winds, Their flesh has the old divine suppleness and strength, They know how to swim, row, ride, wrestle, shoot, run, strike, retreat, advance, resist, defend themselves, They are ultimate in their own right -they are calm, clear, well-possess'd of themselves.
One must heave a heavy sigh at the end of this poem. Written before the inception of International Women's Day, Whitman has accorded us what we most want: Latitude. He has given us latitude: The ability to express ourselves as mammals, varied and complex; the equal and perfect complement of the male. He posits that the best of women "contain all." And isn't it this that we continue to seek: A legitimate range of selfexpression?
I delight in his line: "They are not one jot less than I am." How could you not? Consider for a moment that this poem was written in 1861, long before women got the vote. Long before presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was ridiculed for cankles and colourful pantsuits. Long before Lara Logan sparked a revisit of the "women -read: irresponsible mothers -in the trenches" debate.
Mr. Whitman, Mr. Whitman, George Clooney pales next to you.
So, what has the view from up here taught me?
It has taught me that I don't believe in the notion of primitive cultures. All cultures, even and especially our own, are primitive. For they are informed by gender, firstly and lastly. I suspected it as I moved along my personal space/time continuum. But now I see that my high-flying friend's advice is dead-on. Not to acknowledge the role that sex plays is to set yourself up for failure.
Point in case: I am the most beautiful woman in the world.
No really: I am. It's the only explanation I can think of.
Where do I get the idea? I get it from other women. You see, I must be dauntingly beautiful for I strike fear into the hearts of women. I see it all the time.
For I am single. I operate without the express consent and protection of a man. There is no aegis that shields me. And that makes women uneasy.
As it should. Because women cannot control men, they do the next best thing: They seek to control me.
They do it with censure, scurrilous comment and exclusion. They do it, not because they know me -they don't. They do it because they know men. And I would do the same. Could this be the glitch that impedes our progress?
In another hundred years, International Women's Day will still be trying to navigate this issue.
And it will come away empty-handed. Biology is destiny.
But it is noble to strive and strive we must.
WOMEN'S SHARE OF THE WORKFORCE IN 2006
The labour participation rate of women is lowest in the Arab world. Meanwhile, United Nations data makes no claim that the countries in the Top 10 offer quality jobs for women.
WOMEN'S SHARE OF LEGISLATORS AND MANAGERS IN 2006
Only in the Philippines do women make up a majority of senior decision-makers, while the glass ceiling remains firmly in place in many countries.
WOMEN'S SHARE OF PARLIAMENTARY SEATS IN 2010
Scandinavia and Sub-Saharan Africa are the friendliest regions for female politicians. Meanwhile, the legislatures of many countries still have no women at all.
WOMEN'S FERTILITY RATE IN 2007
The average number of children born to each woman worldwide has dropped from nearly five in 1960 to 2.54 in 2008. Canada is among the least-fertile countries by this measure.
ADOLESCENT BIRTH RATE (15-19 YEARS-OLD)
The teen fertility rate generally drops as a country grows wealthier, although the United States and United Kingdom have high rates for the first world.
WOMEN'S LITERACY RATE COMPARED TO MEN'S 2003-2007
The ratio of women to men who can read tends to be low in troubled countries, whereas official literacy rates tend to reach 99% for both genders in advanced economies such as Canada.
