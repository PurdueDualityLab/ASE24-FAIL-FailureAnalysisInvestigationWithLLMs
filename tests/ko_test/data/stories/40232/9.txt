Parts of the International Space Station lost power for much of Sunday, but the three-member crew was not at risk and everything was fixed by yesterday morning, officials said. A glitch in an electrical power switching unit shut down two communication systems, a gyroscope, some lights and heaters, but there were redundant communications and stabilization systems, said Rob Navias, a NASA spokesman.
