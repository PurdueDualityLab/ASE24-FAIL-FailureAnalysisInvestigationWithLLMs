The three astronauts, however, had to work all day Sunday and early Monday to bring the ISS power grid back on line, it added.
The power outage affectedone of the four onboard gyroscopes that give stability to the ISS, some smoke alarms and scientific equipment including the freezers where research experiments are kept, NASA said.
However, none of theequipment was compromised by the power cut and none of the upcoming activities programmed on the ISS have been affected, NASA said.
