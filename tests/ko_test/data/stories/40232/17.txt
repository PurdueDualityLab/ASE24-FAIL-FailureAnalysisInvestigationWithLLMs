WASHINGTON (AP) - Partsof the International Space Station lost power for much of Sunday, but the three-member crew wasn't at risk and everything was fixed by Monday morning, officials said.
A glitch in anelectrical power switching unit at 1:03 a.m. EST Sunday shut down two communication systems, a gyroscope, some lights and heaters, but there were redundant communications and stabilization systems, NASA spokesman Rob Navias said.
The gyroscope was turnedback on by late Sunday afternoon, and the final communication line was back on Monday morning, Navias said.
NASA is looking into thecause of the problem, which occurred while two American astronauts and a Russian cosmonaut were awake but on a day off, Navias said.
"The biggest net effect was one of inconvenience," he said.
