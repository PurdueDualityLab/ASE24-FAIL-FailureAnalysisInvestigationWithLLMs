Indian-American astronautSunita Williams along with two colleagues experienced power outage aboard the International Space Station, knocking out communications with the Earth on Sunday, but all systems were restored within a day, NASA officials at the Johnson Space Center here said.
On Sunday, a power channel in the station's Port 4 (P4) solar array electrical system shut down due to a glitchwith a distribution device,a direct current switching unit. "The station's three crew members were not in any danger, but it did turn an off-duty day into a full work shift," the space agency said. The power drop led to a temporary loss of ISS communications and the shutdown of heating units, some science equipment and one of the three operating U.S. gyroscopes used for attitude control.
