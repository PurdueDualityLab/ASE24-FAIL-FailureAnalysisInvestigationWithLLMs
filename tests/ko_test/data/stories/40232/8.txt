NASA's Mars spacecraft reports technical glitches
WASHINGTON, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- NASA's engineers are examining why two instruments aboard Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft are intermittently not performing entirely as planned, according to a report announced on Wednesday.
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which manages this Mars spacecraft, said that all other spacecraft instruments are operating well and continue to return science data at record levels.
In late November 2006 the spacecraft team operating the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment camera on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter noticed a significant increase in noise, such as bad pixels, in one of its 14 camera detector pairs. Another detector, that developed the same problem soon after launch, has worsened. Images from the spacecraft camera last month revealed the first signs of this problem in five other detectors.
While the current impact on image quality is small, there is concern as to whether the problem will continue to worsen.
The second instrument concern is related to an instrument designed to routinely scan from the surface across the atmosphere above Mars' horizon. The Mars Climate Sounder maps the temperature, ice clouds and dust distributions in the atmosphere on each of nearly 13 orbits every day. In late December, the sounder appeared to skip steps occasionally, so that its field of view was slightly out of position. Following uplink of new scan tables to the instrument, the position errors stopped and the instrument operated nominally.
In mid-January, the position errors reappeared. Although still intermittent, the errors became more frequent, so the instrument has been temporarily stowed while the science team investigates the problem.
In this month, the spacecraft is set to surpass the record for the most science data returned by any Mars spacecraft. Since beginning its primary science phase in November 2006, the orbiter has returned enough data to fill nearly 1,000 CD-ROMs. This ties the record for Mars data sent back between 1997 and 2006 by NASA's Mars Global Surveyor mission.
The rate of data return is expected to increase over the coming months as the relative motions of Earth and Mars in their orbits around the sun shrink the distance between the planets. By the conclusion of its first science phase in 2008, the mission is expected to have returned more than 30 terabits of science data, enough to fill more than 5,000 CD-ROMs. Observations will be used to evaluate potential landing sites for future missions and to increase our understanding of Mars and how planets change over time.
