Spacecraft at Saturn fulfilling its mission
The Cassini spacecraft, which has been orbiting Saturn since 2004, has been hard at work in recent months.
Last fall, it found indirect evidence of a vast hydrocarbon cloud in the northern latitudes on Saturn's moon Titan. More recently, the spacecraft's radar imager confirmed the existence of hydrocarbon lakes on Titan. Both findings were expected: Scientists have long thought that Titan has a methane cycle of evaporation and condensation, much like the hydrological cycle on Earth.
Now, Cassini's visual and infrared mapping spectrometer has produced direct evidence of the cloud. It's 1,500 miles across and covers the north pole. The image is available at www.nasa.gov/cassini.
Electrical glitch cuts space station power
Parts of the international space station lost power for much of Sunday, but the three-member crew wasn't at risk and everything was fixed by Monday morning, officials said.
A glitch in an electrical power switching unit at 1:03 a.m. shut down two communication systems, a gyroscope, some lights and heaters, but there were redundant communications and stabilization systems, NASA spokesman Rob Navias said.
NASA is looking into the cause of the problem, which occurred while two American astronauts and a Russian cosmonaut were awake but on a day off, Mr. Navias said.
Polar bear breaks leg after amorous play
As first dates go, this one didn't end well. A male polar bear who was trying to court a female polar bear apparently pushed her over the edge of a 14-foot drop while playing last week, Memphis Zoo officials said.
Cranbeary, the 5-year-old female, had surgery Saturday to insert two steel plates and 26 screws to repair a broken leg.
Payton, the 3-year-old male, is on loan from the Brookfield Zoo in Illinois as part of a breeding program. This may be both bears' first romance, and it got a little awkward.
Zoo officials said Cranbeary is in heat, which could have led to Payton's aggressive behavior.
Cranbeary will stay in her cage for at least 10 weeks until her leg is strong enough to return to the exhibit, zoo officials said.
Trafficking in fossils a growing problem
Peruvian archaeologists displayed more than 400 seized shark teeth, shells and fish fossils as old as 12 million years on Friday, saying customs officials have already made twice as many such seizures this year as they did in 2006.
Peru's National Culture Institute said fossil trafficking is a growing problem because the items are highly valued in foreign markets. So far this year, customs agents have made 947 fossil seizures -- at least some bound for the United States -- compared with 461 all of last year.
Southern Peru is particularly rich in fossils, archaeologists said.
