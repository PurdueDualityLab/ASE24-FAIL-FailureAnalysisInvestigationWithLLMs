A day-long power lossaboard the international space station led to a temporary shut down of science and communications equipment and NASA engineers are investigating as to what caused the glitch. It took thirty-one hours for flight controllers and the space station's Expedition 14 crew to restore the ISS system to normal and at no point did the ISS experience any loss of altitude control during the power loss.
