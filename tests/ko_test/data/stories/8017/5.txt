The Monongahela Incline was halted because of mechanical problems Tuesday as officials investigated what they called a mysterious 'glitch.'
The incline, a popular Pittsburgh tourist attraction, usually has its first run around 5 a.m. and carries its last riders at about 2 a.m. the next morning.
The problem arose Tuesday before the first trip. Nobody was on the incline when it quit, said Port Authority Transit spokeswoman Judi McNeil.
It was not immediately clear what was wrong and mechanics didn't know when the incline would be working again, McNeil said. It remained down Tuesday afternoon.
'It doesn't generally happen. It's a very reliable transportation vehicle,' McNeil said. 'We're just trying to figure out what the glitch is.'
A replacement shuttle carried riders up and down the mountainside instead of the incline, which has a spectacular view of the Pittsburgh skyline.
About 2,300 people ride the incline each day, and it has run since the 1850s. It was built to carry immigrant workers to houses on Mount Washington.

GREENSBURG, Pa. (AP) - Authorities awaited the extradition of a military recruit from South Carolina to face a homicide charge.
James J. Strapple Jr., 21, of suburban Greensburg will be discharged from the Marines' boot camp in Parris Island and sent back to Westmoreland County, Detective Michael Brajdich said.
Strapple was accused Monday of second-degree homicide in the death of Glenn Ford, 19, of suburban Pittsburgh last fall. Ford was shot to death near Irwin during a robbery of cash, a gold necklace and cocaine.
Ronald Beers, 20, of Harrison City is accused of pulling the trigger in what District Attorney John Peck called 'an execution-style killing.' The case may justify the death penalty if Beers is convicted, Peck said.
Strapple conspired with Beers and another suspect - Damon Leece of Youngwood, also accused of second-degree homicide - to steal cocaine from Ford, police alleged.
Strapple drove his car to pick up Ford after helping plot the robbery, police said. Leece detailed the crime during an interview with police, authorities alleged.

GREENSBURG, Pa. (AP) - A jury awarded $ 826,000 to the survivors of a man whose tractor tipped over and crushed him while he was driving it up a hill during a blizzard.
Raymond Earhart, 31, died beneath a 1969 Farmall 504 tractor made by Navistar Inc. as he went to hook up a plow during the March 1993 snowstorm in Penn Township, Westmoreland County.
Navistar was ordered Monday to pay the Earhart family $ 733,000 in lost wages and $ 93,000 for the wrongful death claim.
'It still doesn't bring him back,' said Earhart's widow, Suzi.
The Earharts said the tractor should have had a roll guard and a warning about the danger of tipping. Earhart had inherited the tractor from his grandfather in 1992.
Colvin Norwood Jr., an attorney for Navistar, said the tractor was not designed to be operated during a blizzard. He declined to comment on a possible appeal.
Parents and students should have their say before a dress code is enacted at a public high school in Erie, Superintendent James Barker said.
A committee of parents, students and taxpayers has been working on the policy for Strong Vincent High School since school started in the fall.
Its members hope the school will be the first in the area to require uniforms under a state law passed last year.
Surveys mailed to parents' homes show most of those who responded favor the uniforms, said Michelee Curtze, assistant principal and a member of the uniform committee.

MONONGAHELA, Pa. (AP) - A worker was injured when he was pinned by heavy equipment at the construction site of a new toll road.
Mike Talenko, 50, was pinned Monday between the bucket of a front-end loader and a steel bridge girder he was preparing to unload from a truck, officials said.
Talenko was listed in fair condition Tuesday at UPMC Presbyterian hospital in Pittsburgh. He was working on the site of the proposed Mon-Fayette Expressway in Carroll Township, Washington County.
Talenko works for Newnam Enterprises of Baltimore, a subcontractor of Dick Corp. of suburban Pittsburgh, said Andy Peters, a spokesman for Dick Corp.

ERIE, Pa. (AP) - The U.S. Supreme Court has asked for more information before deciding whether it will hear the case of a nude dancing ordinance in Erie.
The state Supreme Court rejected the city's anti-nudity ordinance in 1998, saying it violated the dancers' right to free expression.
The ruling meant female dancers at Kandyland and its successor, Kandy's Dinner Theater, could continue to take the stage without any clothes.
The city ordinance had required them to wear pasties and G-strings. Erie filed a petition for review with the U.S. Supreme Court in January.
The court's clerk sent a letter March 2 to Philip Friedman, the lawyer who represents the club. It asked Friedman to file a written response to the city's request for an appeal.
The U.S. Supreme Court agrees to hear arguments in about 1.8 percent of the 7,650 appeal requests it receives each year, on average.
