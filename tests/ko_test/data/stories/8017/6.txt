The Monongahela Incline was running again today yesterday after workers fixed mechanical problems described by officials as a "computer glitch."
The incline, a popular Pittsburgh tourist attraction, usually has its first run around 5 a.m. and carries its last riders at about 2 a.m. the next morning.
