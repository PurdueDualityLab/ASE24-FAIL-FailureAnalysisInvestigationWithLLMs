When systems go on the blink

DBS Bank's computer system breakdown on Monday was not the first time a technology glitch has disrupted business and raised customers' hackles. Nor will it be the last. But it is a timely reminder that systems can - and do - go down.
A quick scan of news headlines reveals the downside of the technological workhorses that businesses, governments and the general public have become so dependent on. 'US stock plunge raises alarm on algo trading'; 'Nikkei 225 slump caused by bank system fault'; 'Computer glitch slows US air travel'; 'FAA computer glitch delays flights across America'; 'Millions hit by Google breakdown'; and on and on.
Computer failure has caused city-wide power outages, aborted rocket launches, forced large-scale vehicle recalls, and triggered airplane and train malfunctions and crashes. Seen in that context, the loss of access to bank ATMs and online banking facilities might not seem as critical. But is that really so?
Large organisations - be they banks, stock exchanges, car manufacturers or governments - survive and prosper because of the quality of service they provide their respective customers. All the more so when they promise to deliver seamless service, 24/7. In effect, a contract is created, and the consequences of breaking that contract, whatever the reason, are loss of trust and credibility. The organisation's systems and processes are geared towards the smooth delivery of its services and, thus, keeping up its end of the contract. It is thus incumbent on the organisation to ensure that those systems and processes are constantly reviewed, tested and updated.
In fact, Singapore banks are mandated by the regulatory authorities to guarantee 'near-zero system downtime' for their Internet banking services. Such services are considered critical - and rightly so, given Singapore's aspirations as a regional and global financial hub.
And what if, despite all reasonable effort, a system glitch occurs? The principle remains the same: a contract has been broken, trust has been breached, and immediate steps should be taken to redeem the contract and restore that trust. Restoring the system in the shortest possible time is an essential first step; but equally important is keeping the customer in the know - not in the dark - right from the beginning. An immediate announcement that the system is down, accompanied by an apology - it's not so difficult, really.
And going forward, the post-mortem, the search for the reasons for the breakdown, should be transparent. What were the exact factors that caused the crash? What could the organisation, and the technology provider, have done better? The customer deserves to know.
Of course, prevention is better than cure. So, hopefully, the DBS fiasco will provide fresh impetus to other organisations to review their own networks and processes. Not just dollars would be saved - possibly lives too.
