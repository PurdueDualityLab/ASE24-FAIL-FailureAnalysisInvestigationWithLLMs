SINGAPORE : Several people called the Channel NewsAsia hotline on Wednesday, reporting that they could not withdraw money from DBS' ATM machines in Clementi.
Some thought there might have been a repeat of Monday, when a technical glitch shut down the banking network of DBS and its sister bank POSB.
But a DBS spokesperson said its checks showed that one ATM machine at Clementi Central was low on cash.
The other nine machines in the area were all working well.
