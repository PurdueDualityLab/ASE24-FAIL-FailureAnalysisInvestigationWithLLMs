A failure to communicate

THE real concern about DBS Bank's network meltdown reported yesterday ('DBS network hit by 7-hour breakdown'), which paralysed its consumer banking services and part of its corporate banking services, is that the bank has failed miserably in the most essential and critical aspect of how to deal effectively with a crisis of such magnitude.
That weakness is communication.
DBS, with its huge customer base of 3.2 million and close to 1,000 ATMs plus about 80 branches islandwide, must accept the reality that it is a bank that is too big to fail.
But it failed its customers by not taking action, such as broadcasting its network breakdown in the early morning via all media and channels available.
Its chief executive officer and perhaps even its chairman should have made appearances on such platforms to personally convey the problems to the public and update them on the bank's efforts at damage control.
Had this been carried out, customers and merchant vendors would have been better prepared to handle this gigantic glitch.
I hope this case will be an important lesson to other institutions that may fall in the category of being too big to fail.
