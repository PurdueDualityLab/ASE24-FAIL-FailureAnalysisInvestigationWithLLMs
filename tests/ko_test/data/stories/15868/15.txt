Now a closing note on the news: Scores of flights in California and Nevada were canceled again this morning due to a computer glitch. The breakdown affected airports in San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, Sacramento and Reno. The computer failure came during routine maintenance. Last Thursday an air traffic radar system in Los Angeles failed causing delays across a large area of the West.
Kellogg's has shut down production at its Memphis plant because it can't be absolutely certain that the corn being processed there is not genetically altered. But the company says it'll resume production this week after it determines whether or not StarLink is being processed there. You may recall that StarLink is a genetically altered corn product that's intended for use in livestock feed. It is not approved for human consumption.
