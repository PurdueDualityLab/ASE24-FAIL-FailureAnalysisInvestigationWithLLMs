It takes 2 hours to fly nonstop from Los Angeles to Portland, Ore. But first Kylan Gerard had to take a 1-hour cab trip from John Wayne Airport to LAX because his 5:50 p.m. flight out of Orange County was canceled.
Cab fare totaled $77, which United Airlines paid, but the Portland salesman felt obliged to fork over $10 of his own money as a tip.
"He had to drive a long way back," said Gerard, headed home after attending an Irvine seminar.
Gerard's flight was one of at least a half-dozen canceled at John Wayne on Thursday.
Passengers flocked to airport bars and restaurants after a computer glitch put the Southwest's air traffic radar system on hold Thursday morning.
John Wayne Airport spokeswoman Nghia Nguyen said the nationwide "ground stop" that halted flights to and from the West delayed at least nine flights up to 90 minutes.
At Los Angeles International Airport, the problems were worse, turning an ordinary midweek day into a holiday- style nightmare of long lines and canceled flights, said airport spokeswoman Gail Gaddi.
Although the computer problem was corrected by noon, half the flights on the departure monitors were marked delayed or canceled at 7:30 p.m.
An estimated 75,000 passengers were affected at LAX, said Nancy Castles, an airport spokeswoman.
She said the airport averages 100 arrivals and departures every hour involving 150 aircraft. From about 7 a.m. to noon, every one of those flights was delayed or canceled.
"It was very disruptive and had a domino effect," she said, adding that the airport has less traffic from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m., which finally allowed the backup to be absorbed by the evening.
Southwest Airlines alone canceled 70 flights, airline spokesman Melanie Jones said from Dallas.
Other flights were delayed up to four hours.
While some passengers stoically accepted Thursday's delays, others were distraught.
"I've got a grandma dying in New Mexico and I can't get there," said Davis Hill of Boise, Idaho, as he waited for a connecting flight at LAX.
In Orange County, high school students returning to the Bay area from a field trip to Disneyland gave each other E-ticket rides through the lobby using luggage carts. Others merely waited.
"We can't get back home," said Kelly Vinsant, 16, munching pizza. "We are so bored."
John Wayne Airport was "an absolute zoo," said Mike DelVecchio, 44, of New Jersey. Scheduled to leave at 1 p.m., DelVecchio was still sitting in the America West terminal at 7:30 p.m. and didn't expect to get home until 7 a.m. today.
"I know all the America West people, that's for sure," he said.
"I kept going out (for a cigarette) and seeing the same people. The ashtrays are all full -- that's how you know there have been so many delays."
Bill Lapke, 29, arrived at the airport at 2 p.m., hoping to fly home to Seattle. At 7:30 p.m., he was still waiting.
"We've been bumped from one flight to (another)," said Lapke, here on business.
Bartender Marlene Kneller said there was a bright side to the delays: Business was up 80 percent.
"The holidays came here early today," she said. "It was absolutely crazy here."
