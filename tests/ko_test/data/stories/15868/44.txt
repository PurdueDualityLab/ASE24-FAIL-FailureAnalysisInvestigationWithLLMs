A problem with the radar air traffic control system in Southern California caused more than 2,000 passengers to be delayed in El Paso and left others stuck in other cities trying to get to El Paso, airport officials said.
At least 1,700 Southwest Airlines passengers were stalled at El Paso International Airport, and two of the Dallas-based carrier's flights were canceled, said Donna Bochnowski, Southwest Airlines manager of customer service in El Paso.
'We still have a lot of people waiting for their flights,' Bochnowski said. 'But with any computer system there are problems, and of course since we have many flights connected to L.A., we are more affected than other airlines.'
El Paso International Airport officials said 25 Southwest flights faced 'significant' delays as a result of the malfunction at the Federal Aviation Administration's Los Angeles Center in the Mojave Desert community of Palmdale, Calif. That air traffic control center covers much of California and parts of Nevada and Utah. The system broke down twice Thursday morning.
Taylor Steele, 36, of Santa Fe said he had been sitting at the gates for 4A hours waiting to fly to Albuquerque.
'I'm upset because I bought the ticket about two hours ago and they didn't tell me until after I checked my baggage in,' Steele said. 'The airline hasn't done what other airlines would do and try to get you on another flight with someone else.'
Bochnowski said that the airline's main concern was to have passengers get to their destination safely and in a timely manner. Most of the delayed passengers handled the stressful situation well, she said.
El Pasoan Norma Padilla, 26, said the flight problems were an inconvenience but not something to really gripe about.
'I've been waiting for a while now, but the airline has been pretty good about giving us information and I think my flight is loading right now,' she said as a flight boarding announcement filled the gate area.
Darrell Harcourt, 37, said he was trying to fly to Houston and was expecting to wait only two hours because of the radar problem. He said he thought the airline handled the problem pretty well.
'I understand (that it's) because of the radar problem in California,' he said. 'I know that some things can go wrong, and Southwest has handled it adequately.'
The radar problems caused headaches for Southwest employees and passengers, but it boosted the nightly revenue for one airport business. Robert Rubal, a 19-year-old bartender at Cantina Del Rio, said that business picked up quite a bit because of all the delays.
'We're way busier than we usually are, and we served a lot of angry customers because of the airlines,' he said.
