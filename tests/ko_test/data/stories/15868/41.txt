OUR VIEWS -- Radar failure merits probe
Glitch left LAX flights grounded
The fragility of the nation's air traffic control system was very much on display last week as a software problem on a computerized radar system grounded hundredsof flights headed to and from Los Angeles International andother airports in the Southwest.
The problem began at daybreak Wednesday when the Federal Aviation Administration attempted -- unsuccessfully as it turned out -- to upgrade the radar guidance system software at its air traffic control center in Palmdale.
The Palmdale center tracks airlines in and out of this region, an area encompassing some 100,000 square miles, including most of Southern California, parts of Nevada, Arizona and Utah and 250 miles out to sea.
So when the software upgrade failed to take, Palmdale's radar guidance system was down for an hour and 40 minutes, rendering air traffic controllers at the center partially blind. In turn, the FAA declared a Tier 1 alert, which meant thatall planes west of the Mississippi River headed for Southern California destinations were not allowed to take off.
The FAA got the radar system running again for about 15 minutes before the software crashed a second time. It then declared a Tier 2 emergency, which grounded planes nationwide.
It is hard to fault the FAA for attempting to upgrade the software at Palmdale or any other air traffic control center around the country. Because the FAA has been slow to deploy the latest technology, the air control system has been unableto keep up with the exponential growth of air traffic throughout the country.
Nevertheless, it is fair to question just how the FAA has gone about upgrading its computers at Palmdale and other air traffic control centers.
Last week's emergency at Palmdale is only the latest computer- related snafu affecting the air traffic control system. In June of last year, a malfunctioning radar at Minneapolis-St. Paul forced the cancellation or delay of more than 100 flights.
And in May of last year, computer problems at the control center on Long Island, N.Y., caused flight delays at airports in New York, Newark and Philadelphia.
Congress has provided tens of billions of tax dollars to the FAA to modernize the air traffic control system. The software failure at Palmdale, and resulting grounding of hundreds of flights throughout the country, should prompt lawmakers to investigate whether the money has been well spent.
