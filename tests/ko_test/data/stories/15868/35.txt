US AVIATION DELAY
"I've got a grandma dying in New Mexico and I can't get there," said Davis Hill of Boise, Idaho, as he waited for a connecting flight at Los Angeles International Airport.
The problem called into question again the safety of the nation's air traffic control system.
The malfunction took place at the FAA's Los Angeles Center in Palmdale, in the Mojave Desert. The air traffic control center covers much of California and parts of Nevada and Utah. The system broke down twice in the morning.
FAA spokesman Jerry Snyder said a backup system took over and there were no safety problems for aircraft in the air.
However, the backup system does not have the automatic feature that passes off planes from one regional controller to another, and requires a controller to manually type in the flight information.
Hundreds of flights into and out of Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, San Jose, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City were grounded.
Snyder said the failure was the result of a computer software upgrade Wednesday night. "It's not accepting the software," Snyder said.
The first main computer outage lasted more than an hour and a half, from 6:50 to 8:30 a.m. The computer went down again at 9 and was restored again at 11:15, but only after the new software was removed in favor of the old.
The FAA lifted the grounding order in stages to allow an orderly flow of traffic.
