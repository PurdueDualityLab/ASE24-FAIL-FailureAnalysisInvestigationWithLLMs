FAA Administrator Jane Garvey on Saturday promised to enhance air travel for passengers and asked small craft pilots to work with regulators to improve safety.
'It has to be done incrementally, block by block. It's a big, big challenge,' she told more than 1,000 people attending the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association convention in Long Beach, which houses general aviation Long Beach Airport.
Garvey said she will focus on problems with attainable solutions, such as granting more funds to maintain general aviation airports, hiring more flight controllers, and improving air traffic control technology.
She spoke just days after the Federal Aviation Administration radar system guiding aircraft through the Southwest failed, causing flight delays across California, Utah and Nevada. Newly installed software caused computer failures Thursday when a Mexico controller tried to amend a jet's flight plan.
Two technicians said the FAA deliberately rushed the new software despite ensuing glitches, the Orange County Register reported in Saturday's editions.
The FAA pressed ahead because of deadlines to convert all 21 of the nation's air traffic control centers by next month, technician Ron Rahrig told the Register.
'I believe they blundered. They didn't fully test out this system before they put it online,' he told the newspaper.
Garvey told reporters the FAA was not aware of the software problems. She said the agency's radar system is reliable and dependable.
'It's easy to lose sight in a national issue, but think of how many flights land and take off. This country serves over 650 million (passengers). The FAA is still held in extra high regard,' Garvey said.
Small craft pilots said they are concerned about losing general aviation airports to real estate development such as condominiums and shopping malls.
'She was open and understanding of our issues,' said pilot John Driscoll, 46, of Phoenix. 'I liked her reference to community and how it gives and takes.'
Garvey had said during her speech that both regulators and pilots belong to the same community, therefore it's important to 'work together in order to streamline the safety process.'
Frank Ashton, 46, of Los Gatos said it was good just to be able to voice pilot concerns. 'There are hundreds of airports in danger of being closed by (development) pressure. It's good that someone so high up heard us.'
