A six-hour computer breakdown at the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) centre in Fremont, Northern California resulted in nearly 200 flight delays out of various airports relying on the system.
The outage occurred during regular maintenance and required three attempts to get the affected software properly reinstalled and functioning. Airports affected included those in San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, Sacramento and Reno, Nevada.
Some 120 flights were delayed at San Francisco, 38 out of Oakland and 25 out of San Jose according to The Associated Press.
