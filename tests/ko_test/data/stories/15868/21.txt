SEATTLE (AP) - The Seattle School Board gave Superintendent Joseph Olchefske high praise, a 4 percent pay hike and a $1 million life-insurance policy at his second annual job-performance review.
The raise boosts his annual salary to $162,000.
Superintendent since February 1999, Olchefske is credited with hiring outstanding assistants and making tough decisions to fire ineffective principals in the 47,000-student district.
He was also lauded for his leadership in improving fourth-grade test scores in reading and math, encouraging more students to take the SAT, implementing academic standards in elementary schools and bolstering campus safety at the district's 96 schools.
Olchefske took the helm of Seattle schools in February 1999, three months after his predecessor, John Stanford, died of leukemia.

SEATAC, Wash. (AP) - Flight operations at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport returned to normal Thursday afternoon after radar-computer failure in California resulted in morning delays.
Nationwide, hundreds of domestic and international flights headed into or out of the Southwest were delayed or canceled early Thursday because of repeated breakdowns in southern California air traffic control radar.
Here, Sea-Tac airport spokesman Bob Parker said individual airlines handled the delayed flights and the computer glitch caused no problems that came to the attention of the Port of Seattle.
The malfunction took place at the FAA's Los Angeles Center in the Mojave Desert community of Palmdale, an air traffic control center covering much of California and parts of Nevada and Utah. The system broke down twice in the morning.
FAA spokesman Jerry Snyder said a backup system took over and there were no safety problems for the approximately 100 aircraft in the air.
However, the backup system doesn't have the automatic feature that passes off planes from one regional controller to another, and requires a controller to manually type in the flight information.

BREMERTON, Wash. (AP) - Former Kitsap County Chief Deputy Coroner Jan Jermy has settled a lawsuit against the county for $85,000.
Jermy had filed a $1 million lawsuit against the county, claiming her new boss, Greg Sandstrom, fired her after she supported another candidate in the 1998 election.
The county denies any wrongdoing.
Most of the issues in Jermy's original lawsuit - including violation of due process, conspiracy, gender discrimination and intentional infliction of emotional distress - were dismissed in U.S. District Court in June.
But the settlement gives Jermy the right to sue in state court to resolve those claims.

SNOQUALMIE, Wash. (AP) - Crews are building up the banks of the Snoqualmie River in hopes of stemming the heavy erosion winter rains normally bring.
The project includes layering dirt, sand bags and a natural fiber with willow branches that will eventually sprout new brush that will make the banks more sturdy.
Crews are working within the Endangered Species Act, which rules out the earlier practice of shoring up the river banks with rocks.
