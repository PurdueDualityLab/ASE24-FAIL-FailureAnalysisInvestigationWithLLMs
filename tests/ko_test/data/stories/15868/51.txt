Companies Accidentally Post Earnings Early On Web Sites
A pair of high-tech companies were embarrassed when their quarterly earnings announcements were accidentally posted to their corporate Web sites ahead of schedule last week. Earnings announcements are usually carefully timed to hit newswires and each respective company's Web site at the same time to assure that all investors receive the information at the same time in compliance with Securities and Exchange Commission regulations.
But on Oct. 16, the earnings announcement for Novellus, a computer chip maker, accidentally made an early appearance on the company's Web site. The news release appeared on the company's Web site that morning, even though the announcement was not scheduled to be officially made until 4:30 p.m. EST, after the stock market closed for the day. Company officials said the first indication of a problem came when investors suddenly began calling the corporate headquarters. The release had been given ahead of time to a company that was supposed to post it on Novellus' Web site later that afternoon. But the program that scheduled when the release would appear on the Web site had been incorrectly programmed. 'It was a human error,' said Bob Climo, Novellus' director of marketing communications. 'It's a consequence of having to put so much information out so quickly in so many different places these days.' By the time company officials fully understood what had happened, it had already reached the originally scheduled time for the announcement.
Two days later, the headline for Sun Microsystems' earnings announcement accidentally appeared on Sun's Web site before its scheduled release. The company quickly pulled the headline off its Web site after about twenty-five minutes, and the NASDAQ stock exchange temporarily suspended trading in Sun stock. But the damage had already been done, as investors sharply drove up the price of Sun stock before trading could be halted. 'The headline of the release was inadvertently posted to our Web site several hours early,' said Elizabeth McNichols, a Sun spokesperson. 'Immediately after we found out that it was out, we issued the entire news release.'
Airport Train Misses Stop
An automated underground train at the Denver International Airport trapped its passengers for about 20 minutes when its circuit board failed around 3:30 p.m. on Thursday, Oct. 19. According to Chuck Cannon, an airport spokesperson, the train overshot its destination, which was the main terminal, and then stopped. The memory in a circuit board did not read the bar code that tells the train to stop. 'Then the fail-safe kicked in,' said Cannon, 'which causes the trains to stop when something goes wrong.' Airport workers manually moved the train to the station, where the passengers were let off. 'The problem only affected one train ride. It was repaired quickly, within a few minutes,' said Cannon. The spokesman was unsure how many people were on the train when it failed.
Traffic Overload for Online College Fair
An online college fair, sponsored by the National Association for College Admission Concealing, was cut short on Thursday, Oct. 19, when traffic to the Web site became too much for the servers to handle. 'Though we anticipated heavy traffic, and put in state-of-the-art technology in preparation for it, it didn't come all together quite right,' said Mark Cannon, Deputy Executive Director for the NACAC. Some users were denied access to the chat rooms where students could chat with college professionals. When NACAC officials noticed this, they cut the afternoon fair short so that repairs could be made before the evening fair, which began at 7 p.m. 'In an effort to correct the problems, some of the chatting that was going on was suspended for a time,' said Cannon. 'It's a deeply regrettable and frustrating situation for many in the short term, but the problems appear to be fixed and we think in the long term this will appear as a technical hiccup.' The NACAC is trying to expand the reach of the college fair, making it more accessible to students who may not be near a location where one is being held.
