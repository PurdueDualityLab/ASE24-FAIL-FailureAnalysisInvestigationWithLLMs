COMPUTER GLITCH CAUSES FLIGHT DELAYS AIR TRAFFIC SOFTWARE FAILURE JAMS AIRPORTS: [REGION Edition]

Air traffic control computer failures grounded or delayed hundreds of flights into and out of Los Angeles and Orange counties and other parts of the Southwestern United States yesterday, jamming airport terminals with thousands of frustrated travelers.
At Burbank Airport, a Southwest Airlines representative warned over the loudspeaker: "It is possible that any one of you won't get to your final destination today."
Then, she added, jokingly, "Don't shoot the messenger."
A Southwest spokeswoman said 70 Southern California flights were canceled.
"Most are running three or four hours late, if they are getting out at all," spokeswoman Sonja O'Neill said.
Arrival and departure monitors in Los Angeles International Airport's always busy Terminal 1 flashed "delayed" or "canceled" after nearly every flight.
All 2,200 flights into and out of the airport "were delayed in some form or another," said spokeswoman Diana Sanchez, with the length of the delays varying from flight to flight.
The ripple effect spread across the nation, because planes leaving late from LAX arrived late at other airports, causing further delays.
Aviation experts compared the impact to that of a major storm. Storms in the Midwest can be even worse, completely shutting down major hubs like Chicago's O'Hare Airport for hours. During yesterday's delay in Los Angeles, weight-loss guru Richard Simmons tried to lighten the mood at one LAX gate with banter and dancing after he arrived from Philadelphia on a flight that he said had been rerouted and then forced to fly a holding pattern for 45 minutes before landing.
"Honey, I could have been in Paris eating cold oysters by now," he said of his delays.
The FAA's computer problems developed after technicians loaded new software into equipment at the Federal Aviation Administration's Los Angeles Center in Palmdale at midnight, said FAA spokesman Jerry Snyder.
At 6:50 a.m., that software failed for an hour and 40 minutes. The system failed again at 9 a.m. for two hours and 15 minutes, he said.
The new software that developed a glitch yesterday has been installed in 17 other FAA centers with no problems, Snyder said.
"At no time was there ever a question of passenger safety, only question of passenger delay," he said.
Controllers immediately went to back-up systems, Snyder said, "and we never lost radar contact or a visual of any flight."
The computer failures forced the FAA to put a "ground stoppage" across dozens of states on planes scheduled to fly to the southern half of California, the southern third of Nevada, the western third of Arizona and "a little smidgen of southwest Utah," Snyder said.
Eliot Brenner, an FAA spokesman in Washington, said the delays were primarily west of the Mississippi, involving traffic headed to the West Coast.
At McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, spokeswoman Hilarie Grey said 40 flights were held during the radar glitch. She said the airport struggled until mid-afternoon to return to "some normalcy."
"We have lots and lots of delays and cancellations on the board," she said.
