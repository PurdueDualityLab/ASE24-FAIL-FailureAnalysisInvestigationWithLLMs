Even if the wait seems endless, it's likely that travelers making their first visit to the new terminal at San Francisco International Airport will consider the finished product worth the delays.
The five-story, 2 1/2-million-square-foot international terminal which effectively doubles the size of the airport is expected to help ease traffic snarls and eliminate congestion at check-in counters.
Airport managers are hoping to begin operations at the terminal this year, and recently set Dec. 10 as a target date. Computer and telecommunications glitches scuttled last month's scheduled grand opening. But for a month, SunTrips charter planes have been flying in and out of the terminal, and stores and restaurants are starting to open. The curious can reach the new terminal by airport shuttle.
The rest of the five-year, $2.4 billion expansion project is still in the works, too two parking garages won't be ready until the end of the year, and a BART extension and light-rail system aren't expected to open until the end of 2001.
Passengers rushing to catch planes might not have time to appreciate the terminal's architectural nuances, but they'll undoubtedly marvel at the massive ticket lobby, wide corridors, friendly seating areas and choice of restaurants and upscale retail shops.
Perhaps as important, those check-in lines that once snaked through the old international terminal and still annoy travelers at many domestic terminals are expected to be considerably shorter. The new facility has 168 ticket counters, 24 departure gates (up from 10) and triple the facilities for customs and immigration. Eventually, the new terminal will handle up to 260 flights a day.
There are also 12 available baggage carousels (compared to two at the old building), and business travelers will find more places to plug in their laptops, including technology lounges.
'The old terminal has become obsolete,' said Jane Sullivan, SFO's public affairs manager. 'It was built in 1954, before jets. It's taken a toll.'
Because space at SFO is at a premium the terminal is wedged between the freeway and the existing airport architects had to build up rather than out. (SFO, for example, sits on 2,400 acres, compared to 34,000 acres at Denver International Airport.) The terminal building occupies five floors, including separate levels for ground transportation, arrivals, departures and offices. Boarding areas are on two levels: one for shops and restaurants, another for departing passengers.
The airport, already the fifth busiest in the country, is expanding to meet an anticipated increase in international visitors. Some 7 million passengers passed through the international terminal in 1998; 12 million are expected by 2006, with 70 percent of that growth coming from the Pacific Rim.
'There's a middle class developing in China, and they're going to get on airplanes,' Sullivan said. 'A lot of them are going to come here, without a doubt. We want them to come here.'
Light and bright
Although the $1 billion terminal the largest in North America based on square footage might not unseat the Golden Gate Bridge as the city's preeminent landmark, it nonetheless possesses a kind of uniqueness that won't go unnoticed by visitors. Its facade is constructed of glass panes, enough to light the inside of the building in the daytime with a minimum of artificial lighting. Its back wall, which divides the main ticketing area from the food pavilion and retail shops, is made of huge panels of cherrywood and horizontal metal slats. Above the building's 70-foot-high steel trusses, ceiling panes direct colorful rays of light in various directions.
Airport and airline offices and passenger lounges will be located behind the cherrywood wall on two floors, with smaller, more convenient offices above the ticket counters. Airport officials granted airlines' request for accessible office space, saving personnel time and distance, although passengers are unlikely to notice that business is being conducted above them.
The winglike roofline, easily visible to commuters on Highway 101, is intended to create a soaring sense of flight. It was designed by Craig Hartman, a partner in the San Francisco office of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, which led the project of eight architectural firms involved in creating the terminal and boarding areas.
The terminal's long-term success no doubt will depend on how well it functions, from processing arriving passengers to alleviating long lines at counters and gates. The first time a traveler loses a bag or misses a flight, it won't matter how efficiently things are operating.
'We learned our lessons the hard way,' said Chuck Cannon, a spokesman for Denver International Airport, which opened 16 months later than expected in 1995 because of a malfunctioning automated-baggage system. 'Once we opened, things went smoothly, but you're never problem-free. Things fall through the cracks.'
New luggage technology
To avoid similar problems, SFO kept its old baggage system but added new technology that will help it locate misplaced luggage or tell travelers if their bags made it on the flight.
Travelers can also expect to pass through the tedious customs process more quickly. Rather than claim their bags immediately after exiting a plane a system that causes crowds at luggage carousels arriving passengers will pass through immigration first, then pick up their baggage before clearing customs. Airport officials say it's possible travelers can be out the door in about 45 minutes, although they're still being shuttled to the old terminal for customs processing until the new area is finished.
Traffic routing to improve
The benefits of the new terminal extend to domestic fliers as well. A new roadway system already makes it easier to enter and exit the airport, and the two additional parking garages will add more than 3,000 spaces and cut down on traffic near the three other terminals. So, too, will new BART stations at the airport and Millbrae. Getting to the airport from downtown San Francisco is expected to take less than a half hour.
AirTrain, the airport's light-rail system, should reduce airport traffic by 25 percent. It will make nine stops throughout the airport, dropping off passengers at terminals, parking lots, the car-rental center and, eventually, a new hotel and long-term parking. Riding the trains, which hold 30 passengers each, will be free of charge.
The old international terminal, built in 1954, will get its own makeover, undergoing a retrofitting and eventually reopening for domestic use, perhaps as United Shuttle.
But that won't signal the end of changes to the airport. A new runway system, if it's approved, will add another five years to the expansion, and a new hotel won't be ready before 2005.
'People ask all the time, When are you going to be done?'' Sullivan said. 'We will never be done. The industry is changing so fast because airports are basically old. They've been around 40, 50 years, and they weren't built to handle the amount of passengers that are going through them.'
This one will handle them, at least for the next several years.
