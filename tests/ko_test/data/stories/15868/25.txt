DENVER (AP) - Dozens of travelers were stuck on an underground train that ferries passengers between concourses at Denver International Airport Thursday after a glitch in a computer caused the train to overshoot the main terminal.
It was unclear how many people were aboard when the cars stopped at about 3:30 p.m., but the trains are designed to hold about 80 people and their luggage, airport spokesman Chuck Cannon said. No injuries were reported.
It took workers about 20 minutes to move the train to a station, where passengers got off.
"Nobody got off in the tunnels or anything like that," Cannon said.
A circuit board on the automated train lost its memory and failed to read a bar code that signals it to stop. The train overshot the station and safety mechanisms kicked in, Cannon said.
Trains returning from the concourses to the main terminal usually travel on the terminal's west tracks. The train that malfunctioned was on the east tracks while workers performed maintenance on an elevator.
Airport officials were in contact with passengers by radio. Technicians had to walk through the train tunnel for five to six minutes to reach the stalled cars, Cannon said.
Most of the passengers appeared to be arriving at the airport, Cannon said.
Maintenance workers repaired the train by about 4 p.m. and trains were running normally by about 4:15 p.m. Only slight delays in the trains' schedule were reported.
Cannon said the breakdown was unrelated to labor disputes at the airport.
Pittsburgh-based Adtranz, which operates the automated trains, and the International Union of Elevator Constructors Local 25 reached a contract agreement in February.
About 85 workers employed by Phelps Program Management who operate United Airlines' baggage system remained on strike Thursday.
The strike over wages and benefits began Sept. 26. Both sides have been meeting with a federal mediator.
