Radar glitches ground flights in U.S. Southwest

Across the country and around the world, hundreds of flights headed into or out of the Southwest United States were grounded Thursday because of repeated breakdowns in the region's air traffic control radar.
By the time the order from the Federal Aviation Administration was lifted more than four hours later, airports around the country were gridlocked with aircraft lined up on the ground, flights cancelled and thousands of passengers stranded or delayed.
'I've got a grandma dying in New Mexico and I can't get there,' said Davis Hill of Boise, Idaho, as he waited for a connecting flight at Los Angeles International Airport.
The problem called into question again the safety of the country's air traffic control system.
The malfunction took place at the FAA's Los Angeles Center in the Mojave Desert community of Palmdale. The air traffic control centre covers much of California and parts of Nevada and Utah. The system broke down twice in the morning.
Jerry Snyder, an FAA spokesman, said a backup system took over and there were no safety problems for aircraft in the air.
However, the backup system doesn't have the automatic feature that passes off planes from one regional controller to another and requires a controller to manually type in the flight information.
Hundreds of flights into and out of Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, San Jose, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City were grounded.
Snyder said the failure was the result of a computer software upgrade Wednesday night. 'It's not accepting the software,' Snyder said.
The first main computer outage lasted more than an hour and a half, from 6:50 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. The computer went down again at 9 a.m. and was restored again at 11:15 a.m., but only after the new software was removed in favour of the old. 1755ES 19-10-00
