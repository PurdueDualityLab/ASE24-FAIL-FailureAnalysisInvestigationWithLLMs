Although a date for the grand opening of the international terminal remains up in the air, San Francisco airport officials yesterday said they will host public tours of the new terminal Dec. 3.
The tours will be part of a daylong 'community open house and family day' to celebrate the near-completion of what will become the largest international terminal in North America. Admission will be free, but tickets are limited to 50,000 people.
In announcing the open house, SFO Director John Martin told the media and several hundred hard-hatted construction workers that the terminal 'will be a beautiful symbol of San Francisco.' About 8 million passengers are expected to pass through its gates in the first year of operation.
SFO officials said they reluctantly must limit the number of people at the open house to avoid congestion during the busy holiday season. Tickets are free, but normal parking rates apply -- $8 for two hours.
Meanwhile, Martin balked at the bigger question of when the airlines will abandon the current international terminal, built in 1954, and move into the new one. A tentative date of Dec. 10 has been set, although, Martin said, a final announcement will not be made for about two weeks.
Instead, a few flights a day are using the terminal to test out the baggage system, computerized check-in counters and the dozens of other components. As of yesterday, 30,000 passengers and 40,000 pieces of luggage have passed through the terminal since testing began last month.
Today will mark another step forward: For the first time, passengers are scheduled to arrive on an international flight and pass through the U.S. Customs Service area in the new terminal. During the past six weeks, international passengers arriving at the new foreign terminal have taken buses to the old terminal for processing through customs.
SFO spokesman Ron Wilson said customs officials agreed to staff the new foreign terminal with a small crew in order to find and fix any potential glitches. An Allegro Airlines flight from Mexico scheduled to arrive at 2 p.m. is expected to be the first to use the new customs area -- barring weather-related delays such as those that slowed airport traffic yesterday morning.
On Wednesday, airport officials plan to begin testing the second of the two boarding areas that will be used for international flights. Testing has so far been isolated to one of the boarding areas.
Martin said SFO is 'establishing a new model for opening new, large international terminals' by gradually testing systems rather than transferring operations overnight.
Problems from baggage-eating conveyors to crashed computers plagued the opening of new airports from Malaysia to Italy in the past few years, problems, SFO officials promise, will not be repeated.
