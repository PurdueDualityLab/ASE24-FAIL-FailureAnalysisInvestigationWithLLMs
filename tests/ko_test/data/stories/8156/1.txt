The state's largest school districts are having a variety of problems with proficiency tests, including blank pages, incorrect answer sheets and late shipments, the Akron Beacon Journal reported on Friday.
Flaws have been identified with the fourth-, sixth- and ninth-grade tests and with all five parts of the exams: reading, writing, math, citizenship and science, the newspaper said.
Sometimes students had to wait hours or up to a week while problems were sorted out. In Cleveland, tests that were late to arrive had to be distributed over a weekend to administrators' homes, the newspaper said.
The tests are important because they help determine district effectiveness and student promotions.
The Beacon Journal talked to administrators at the state's eight largest districts and found that Cincinnati was the only one that did not have problems. The other districts were Akron, Cleveland, Canton, Columbus, Dayton, Toledo and Youngstown.
Lee Ann Rogers, a spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Education, said Friday that the problems are not typical and people should not be overly alarmed.
'It's almost like a snowball effect,' she said. 'A lot of small glitches that are suddenly becoming one big problem.'
She said the department's priority is to make sure children can take the test fairly. As that happens, the agency is looking for ways to prevent problems from happening next year.
Concerns about the ninth-grade writing test emerged earlier this year after questions on the test were published before everyone had taken it. The fourth- and sixth-grade writing tests were invalidated earlier this month after questions were published.
Another problem previously reported included multiple choice questions with possible answers listed as A, B, D and D.
In January, Ohio will issue report cards about districts, part of a process to determine whether they should be taken over by the state because of poor student performance.
Ellen Goggins, Akron's director of testing, is concerned because the report cards will be based at least partially on the proficiency test. 'And we know it's not valid,' she said.
The Education Department does not believe at this point that the test problems will make the report cards invalid, Rogers said.
Gov. Bob Taft said Thursday there is reason to be concerned about the proficiency tests. He promised to talk to the state superintendent of education to make sure the agency works to restore the tests' integrity.
Scott Milburn, a spokesman for the governor, said Friday that although there have been some 'hiccups' with the tests, Taft is confident the Education Department can fix the problems. He said the tests remain a valuable tool to measure student achievement.
Bert Wiser, director of assessment and testing for Columbus schools, said he is concerned that the publishing contractor may have too much work.
National Computing Systems of Iowa City, Iowa, had the contract to provide ninth- and 12th-grade tests and last year won the contract to provide the fourth- and sixth-grade tests.
NCS is the largest standardized test publisher in the country. The company said it graded 50 million tests in 1997.
Administrators were in a staff meeting and unavailable to comment on Friday, a receptionist said. A telephone message was left.
