Problems with school proficiency tests are more widespread than thought and more administrators are asking for test parts to be invalidated, the Akron Beacon Journal reported today.
Flaws have been identified with the fourth-, fifth- and ninth- grade tests and with all five parts of the exams: reading, writing, math, citizenship and science, the newspaper said.
The paper cited its own survey of the state's eight largest districts. It showed all but Cincinnati have testing problems. The others were Akron, Cleveland, Canton, Columbus, Dayton, Toledo and Youngstown.
Some problems included faulty answer sheets, improperly distributed tests, missing pages and defective booklets.
Lee Ann Rogers, a spokeswoman for the Department of Education, called the problems "hiccups or glitches."
"They seem to be the same problems happening sporadically across the state," she said.
A message left for her today for more comment was not immediately returned.
Concerns about the ninth-grade writing test emerged earlier this year after questions on the test were published before everyone had taken it. The fourth- and sixth-grade writing tests were invalidated earlier this month after questions were published.
Another problem previously reported included multiple- choice questions with possible answers listed as A, B, D and D.
The tests are used to determine district effectiveness and student promotion or retention. Educators question if they can be trusted, the paper said.
Gov. Bob Taft said Thursday "there is reason to be concerned." He pledged to press the state superintendent to restore the tests' integrity.
