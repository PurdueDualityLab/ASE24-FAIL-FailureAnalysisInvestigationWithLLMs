Problems with school proficiency tests are more widespread than earlier thought and more administrators are asking for parts to be invalidated, the Akron Beacon Journal reported today.
Flaws have been identified with the fourth-, fifth- and ninth-grade tests and with all five parts of the exams: reading, writing, math, citizenship and science, the newspaper said.
The paper cited its own survey of the state's eight largest districts. It showed all but Cincinnati have testing problems. The others were Akron, Cleveland, Canton, Columbus, Dayton, Toledo and Youngstown.
Some problems included faulty answer sheets, improperly distributed tests, missing pages and defective booklets.
Lee Ann Rogers, a spokeswoman for the Department of Education, called the problems 'hiccups or glitches.'
'They seem to be the same problems happening sporadically across the state,' she said.
A message left for her today for more comment was not immediately returned.
Concerns about the ninth-grade writing test emerged earlier this year after questions on the test were published before everyone had taken it. The fourth- and sixth-grade writing tests were invalidated earlier this month after questions were published.
Another problem previously reported included multiple choice questions with possible answers listed as A, B, D and D.
The tests are important because they help determine district effectiveness and student promotion or retention. Educators question whether they can be trusted, the newspaper said.
Gov. Bob Taft said Thursday 'there is reason to be concerned.' He promised to talk to the state superintendent of education to make sure the agency works to restore the tests' integrity.
Bert Wiser, director of assessment and testing for Columbus schools, said he is concerned that the publishing contractor may have too much work.
National Computing Systems of Iowa City, Iowa, is the largest standardized test publisher in the country. The company said it graded 50 million tests in 1997.
NCS had the contract to provide ninth- and 12th-grade tests and last year won the contract to provide the fourth- and sixth-grade tests.
Administrators were in a staff meeting and unavailable to comment immediately today, a receptionist said.
