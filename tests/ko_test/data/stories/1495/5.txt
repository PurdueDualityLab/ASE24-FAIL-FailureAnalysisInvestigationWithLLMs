Parents don't like surprises when they are buying products for their children. They pass over alien-looking goods for the comfortable, the familiar, the trustworthy. This is Walt Disney Co.'s domain, and the company's sacred pact with parents has built a $10 billion corporation.
So when three-year-old Cailin Flaherty dissolved into tears on Christmas morning, it was the kind of event that shakes Disney to its foundations. Like thousands of other children who found Disney's "The Lion King" CD-ROM under the tree, she was disappointed when her dad couldn't get the program to work on the family computer: Video would freeze midframe. Dad, a software specialist with a relatively powerful computer, wasn't too pleased, either, when Disney didn't respond to his repeated requests to fix the problem.
"I expected much better from a company such as Disney," Terry Flaherty wrote to its chairman and chief executive officer, Michael Eisner. "My confidence, as well as many others', in your company has been damaged."
Mr. Flaherty finally got a response from Disney on Friday. The company promised a technician would be in touch with him.
"We regret that customers have had incompatibility problems and we are 100% committed to customer satisfaction," says Steve McBeth, president of Disney Interactive, the company's software arm. "We won't be satisfied until all compatibility problems are removed."
How could Disney -- king of children's entertainment and moviedom's reigning box-office leader -- fumble at what would seem to be its own game? The answer is a study not only in Disney corporate culture but also in Hollywood's awkward flirtations with computer technology. As Cailin Flaherty's distress and similar problems in thousands of households make painfully clear, multimedia is more lion's play than children's.
Like other major Hollywood "content providers," Disney had been surpassed in the software universe by Silicon Valley upstarts with names like Broderbund and Electronic Arts, which built a huge business designing high-tech entertainment software for the home. Although Disney has the most-recognized characters in the world, plus a reputation for cutting-edge technology in its animated films and theme-park rides, the company had been fitfully trying to master the software business since 1988.
Then, this past Christmas season, Disney decided it was time to pounce on the CD-ROM market. With a huge $3 million advertising campaign timed to the re-release of the highest grossing animated film of all time, Disney pumped almost 300,000 units of the "Lion King" into Wal-Marts and Kmarts everywhere, and overnight produced the fastest-selling children's title ever. Consumers have bought more than 200,000 to date.
Disney executives, skeptical in the past when Hollywood seemed infatuated with new technologies, now say the company will build its computer-software division to a $1 billion business within five years -- a fivefold increase from what it is currently estimated to draw. (Disney won't disclose financial results for the software arm.)
Clearly, such new business would be welcome in a company that, despite a decade of enormous growth, has lately seen its theme-park business stagnate and its movie division endure a major overhaul of top management. Disney wants to find profitable businesses in the interactive arena. But in a world worried about wiring and 500-channel television, the company remains focused on providing content for other people's systems.
Now, say company officials, one part of the puzzle is falling into place. As more-powerful, cheaper computers enter homes by the millions, a marketing and technical base is emerging that Disney officials believe will support the level of programming that has worked for it in other media. "Something fundamental has happened," Mr. McBeth contends.
For now, Disney and others are pinning much of their hope on CD-ROMs, the silvery compact disks that can store huge, though still limited, amounts of digital data. These disks hold enough information to produce acceptable color motion pictures and sound on computers. Theoretically, the CD-ROM market is big and mushrooming. Already 7.8 million home computers are thought to have the equipment that can read these disks, three times the number of just a year ago, according to industry consultant Dataquest Inc.
But in practice, an unknown amount of this equipment already is obsolete. And standards needed for software to mesh smoothly with home equipment are foggy. Disney, which had such success selling the "Lion King" CD-ROM, discovered painfully that it was another thing to make it work.
The venom set in on Dec. 26 and built as days and weeks went by and angry consumer messages went unanswered. Mr. Flaherty's missive was just one of thousands pouring into Disney by mail, phone and computer. "Is anybody out there?" asked a plaintive user on one computer-service board operated by Disney. Other messages complained of fundamental broken trust and corporate arrogance. "My whole family has a tarnished image of Disney right now," said an angry note. Still other writers threatened to cancel plans to visit Walt Disney World.
Disney officials first went on the offensive. They complained to the media that neophyte users didn't know what they were doing, that they had failed to read a tiny technical message on the bottom of the box and that many users' equipment was obsolete. More recently, Disney's public tone has grown humbler, and the company has increased its product support staff from eight employees when it introduced "Lion King" before Christmas to about 50 today, an unexpected expense.
As company officials now concede, the program was marketed with known errors, wrongly believed to affect only a minute percentage of computers. Also, a misjudgment was made that allowed "Lion King" to run only on computers with up-to-date sound equipment. (Other versions are now being sent to disappointed buyers.) But pressed by the approach of Christmas and the re-release of the film, Disney released the CD-ROM.
As with other home-computer programs published by Disney, technical work on "Lion King" was done by an outside contractor. Closely held Media Station Inc. of Ann Arbor, Mich., used an elaborate "software engine" of its own design to stitch together sound and drawings by Disney artists. Final quality assurance was Disney's job. Disney says it was told by both Media Station and Microsoft Corp., which had produced sections of the software code, of the program's bugs.
When "Lion King" works, users find the elegant coloring and slickly drawn characters of the Disney movie. The tale of Simba the lion, whose father, king of beasts, dies and who fights an evil uncle to regain his father's throne, is told in the digested form of an electronic storybook.
Opinions of the 18 screens of narrative and three interactive games vary. In informal testing at Home PC magazine, "it was clear that children love `Lion King'; it was also clear that the love began before they sat down with the program," reports Carol Ellison, editor. Some home users have a different view. "I got the program to work after spending $300 to upgrade our computer," says Charles Hammerslough, who bought the program for his young daughter for Christmas. "After all of that, it was a bit of a yawner."
Though glitches are widespread throughout the software industry, Disney's approach with "Lion King" says much about its lingering unfamiliarity with the business. Companies specializing in children's computer programs generally go to considerable lengths to settle problems, having learned the hard way about parental angst and anger.
While "Lion King" buyers waited days and even weeks for help, at least one children's software company kept support lines open even Christmas Day, anticipating an influx of calls. "People were thrilled that we were there," says Larry Gross, vice president of consumer satisfaction and co-founder of children's software maker Knowledge Adventure Inc. of La Crescenta, Calif. Disney's support board opened the day after Christmas with an expanded staff but was overloaded instantly, company officials say. An 800 number, opened days later, was swamped as well.
"Somehow, it simply isn't easy for Hollywood to figure out what works in software," says Sam Poole, president of software maker Maxis of Orinda, Calif., and a former marketing head of Disney's past software effort. Mr. Poole recalls that, during Christmas 1993, he had to delay until January a key upgrade of Maxis' hot-selling SimCity software to make the program more reliable. But, he notes, Maxis wasn't driven by a simultaneous multimillion-dollar movie release, as Disney was.
Far from jeering at Disney's badly stubbed toe, competitors worry that an angry public could reject all multimedia programming after the "Lion King" experience. "Companies might snicker at Disney and their problems, but in fact it's a problem for all of us," says Ron Gilbert, co-founder and creative director of Humongous Entertainment Inc. of Woodinville, Wash., a producer of multimedia programs for children.
Disney has had years to understand software. In the early 1980s, Disney, like most studios, licensed the use of its characters for video-cartridge games. It was a profitable business, but a limited one: Outside companies put together and sold programs as Disney monitored them to make sure that Goofy, Donald Duck and others stayed in character. The key was to take little risk for maximum income.
That attitude began to change as other software makers prospered. Consultants told Disney it could have a $100 million-plus annual business in a few years if it entered the fray. In 1989, after the success of a computer game based on the movie "Who Framed Roger Rabbit," the company created the Disney Software division.
Though opened with fanfare and high hopes, Disney Software was a half-hearted effort, say many who worked there. Despite its name, programming was done by outsiders. And, though it held a creative mandate, the unit remained lodged firmly in Disney's Consumer Products arm, where the focus is lucrative licensing of everything from T-shirts to coffee mugs. Some software products prompted flurries of excitement, but titles for young children such as "Mickey's ABC's" and "Mickey's 123's," were surpassed by programs from specialized software producers, though Disney continues to market some of those programs. "Somehow, Disney never got it right," says Robin Raskin, editor of PC Magazine and a writer about children's software.
Meanwhile, there was a culture clash within. Game designers pursued wacky concepts far from Disney's wholesome mandate. Company Vice Chairman Roy E. Disney, nephew of the founder, cost the company millions when he angrily demanded that a game based on Uncle Walt's classic movie "Fantasia" be withdrawn even after it went to market, because he felt the images didn't live up to the original. Yet Disney held to paltry budgets for most programs, former employees say.
By late 1991, Disney Software was under stiff scrutiny from top management as its financial results came in far below forecast. An agonizing reappraisal began. For more than a year Disney Software limped along, barred from designing new products. Selling the unit was considered, and joint partnering was pitched to major software houses. Top talent, meanwhile, bailed out quickly.
Only recently has Disney completed an ambitious new strategy for designing its own software. In the meantime, however, the company has focused its attention first on the video-cartridge game business where it had for years profited handsomely -- if for the most part unimaginatively -- through licensing.
Working closely with what was then the U.S. unit of closely held Virgin Interactive Entertainment PLC, Disney devised a video game based on its blockbuster "Aladdin" movie. The game, widely praised, was a major commercial success. More recently, Disney has used the same careful attention and skills at Virgin Interactive to produce a "Lion King" cartridge game that also has drawn praise. Disney plans to produce with other contractors games based on "Pinocchio" and its coming animated film "Pocahontas."
Disney Interactive, the name adopted last month by the rapidly expanding software unit, has unveiled ambitious plans. By the end of this year, the new operation expects to have 300 employees, up from about 125 currently and a low of 40 when Disney Software was in disfavor. And in a key move, Disney has shifted reporting patterns for Disney Interactive, moving authority from the sole control of the consumer-products arm to shared responsibility with the television and telecommunications division.
Unsaid publicly, however, are even more striking plans to build a full-fledged software operation within the Disney organization. Bit by bit, Disney insiders say, the actual writing of software -- long disdained as a technical task best assigned to subcontractor and licensees -- will be brought in-house.
Yet, can a full-scale, independent-minded software unit last in the very different culture of a Hollywood enterprise? Mr. McBeth says yes -- that Disney has come to understand that in order to make successful multimedia software, it needs to treat the technical aspects of software programming as an art.
For the moment, however, Disney remains closely tied to its outside technical help in the CD-ROM business. Media Station, the contractor for the "Lion King" program, currently is finishing work on the multimedia "Pocahontas." Both CD-ROM and movie are to be released later this year. Also near completion with Media Station is "Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree." Disney says it is very pleased with both programs.
Another CD-ROM product, the Aladdin Activity Center, which didn't have the marketing buildup, the record sales or the same degree of technical problems of the "Lion King" program, was done with another outside contractor.
Eventually, however, Disney will bring closely under its wing the software work it now recognizes is so important. "We're at a critical juncture in the CD-ROM business, when it ceases to be a fringe business and becomes a core business," says Peter Black, founder of Xiphias, a software developer in Los Angeles.
Time will tell whether the Lion King's creator has learned the lessons of the multimedia jungle. From within, Disney executives somewhat wearily contend that, whatever Disney does, its work will be carefully scrutinized. "We're very visible," says Richard H. Frank, chairman of Walt Disney Television and Telecommunications, one of the corporate arms overseeing Disney Interactive. "That's why people are happy to point to our problems."
