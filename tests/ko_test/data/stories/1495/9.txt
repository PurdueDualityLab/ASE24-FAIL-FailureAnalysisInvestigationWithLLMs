Warner Bros. Studios inBurbank is the latest entertainment group to jump on the interactive bandwagon - and executives there are wondering how bumpy the ride will be.
Little more than a weekago, Warner created a division to develop CD-ROMs and video games based on Looney Tunes cartoons and the studio's films. By doing so, the studio added yet another multimedia developer to parent company Time Warner Inc.'s list of five interactive divisions.
The other divisions havebeen largely successful because they produce mostly data and nonfiction titles that are well-established in the market, said Steven Koltai, the senior vice president overseeing the operation. But it's unclear how well the public will respond to the entertainment-oriented titles Warner will offer, Koltai said.
"That's the $64,000question," he said. "I think there's a tremendous amount of hype and smoke (over) what everyone says exists in this media."
Yet Warner is just one ofmany studios taking the same big plunge into the multimedia market. In the past year, most of the major film studios announced plans to create divisions that would develop interactive games in response to skyrocketing multimedia computer sales - an estimated 13 million units sold in 1994 alone.
Walt Disney Co., MGM/UA,MCA Inc., Warner Bros., Twentieth Century Fox and Paramount Studios parent Viacom Inc. all created interactive divisions within the past 12 months. Sony Pictures Entertainment has had operations for three years.
Some analysts believe there has been a pack mentality among film companies to create interactive groups.
"There's a concern thatyou're going to get left behind," said Vince Broady, executive editor for Multimedia World in San Francisco, a trade magazine. "It'll be interesting to see who's making money at it."
There also is a question of whether the film studios should be in the interactive business, analysts said.
A studio's product oftenis licensed to be manufactured by other companies that are more expert in a particular field, such as stuffed animals or T-shirts.
In this case, however,the studios are keeping product development closer to home. Some are contracting out with computer companies to help develop a product, but oversight of the creative content is being done by the studio along with distribution and sales.
Studios have made severalmiscalculations in the past about which product lines they should sell on their own, said Dave Davis, analyst for Paul Kagan Associates in Los Angeles. In the 1980s, film studios could have gotten involved in video rental stores but were reluctant, he said.
"From that apprehensiongrew Blockbuster Entertainment," Davis said of the video retail giant. "They're the largest purchaser of film products."
Ted Hoff, vice presidentand general manager for Fox Interactive, said his company not only wanted to reap the potential financial rewards but also wanted to maintain control over content. Fox created its interactive division in May and plans to sell games based on "The Simpsons" animated television series and "Die Hard" movies.
"(With) an arm's lengthrelations with someone you license the product to, the product begins to diminish," Hoff said. "You lose some things because you have given someone thousands of miles away the approval to do that."
The main challenge tostudios is what approach they should take in developing products. Many executives agree it is essential that an engaging game or other interactive experience - such as instruction for children - is essential for success.
"The more important thingfor me to do is exploit the technology and use the content as a vehicle," Hoff said. "It has to be a great game."
But other studios believethat it doesn't hurt to have a familiar character or product that naturally lends itself to computer games. Having a long-term stake in the business also helps.
Lucas Arts EntertainmentCo. is finding itself consistently in Top 10 lists for game sales, much of it due to the strength of sales based on its "Star Wars" line. The San Rafael-based firm is owned by George Lucas, director of the hit science fiction movie.
Lucas Arts was formed in1982 and began publishing software titles in 1987. It has several titles related to "Star Wars" and "Indiana Jones," another series of Lucas movies.
"Star Wars (games) havedistinguished themselves as huge sellers," said Randy Komisar, Lucas Arts president. "If you've got something as precious as the Star Wars properties or the Disney properties, you've got a leg up."
Disney actually starteddeveloping software products seven years ago but formally created an interactive division in December. The Glendale-based division, Disney Interactive, plans to have 300 workers by year's end, said Steve McBeth, president.
Already the company hasadded more than 50 workers since December. Disney also has two titles in the top 10 CD-ROM lists, the "Lion King Storybook" and the "Aladdin Activity Center," and eventually plans to publish 55 titles a year.
McBeth said the business has been profitable for Disney but would not provide actual numbers.
The division learned itsfirst hard lesson in the interactive market last month when "Lion King" buyers complained they couldn't get sound and video to work on their older machines. Customers also had trouble reaching technicians to work out the problem.
McBeth said the divisionhas worked to take care of customer service problems and is coming out with new versions of the software that will work on older machines. The glitch affected less than 5 percent of the buyers, he said.
He attributed theexperience to lessons a company learns when it gets into a new business, particularly one that involves technology. In this case, Disney discovered there often are different standards for various types of software.
"I think all of theplayers in Hollywood are going to be working with the same sets of issues as these (businesses) are growing," McBeth said.
Experience in themarketplace, plus an inherent experience with technology also has helped Sony's ImageSoft division in Santa Monica. The company is able to draw on technology as well as its entertainment entities to come up with titles, said spokesman Jeff Fox.
Sony has developed 100titles thus far. It is at the point now where it is developing films with the intent of marketing them as video games, such as the upcoming "Johnny Mnemonic," a futuristic tale involving a data courier who must reach a destination with his package or face death.
Sony now has 250 workers in Santa Monica and the company's software publishing arm overall has 1,500 employees nationwide.
"We have plans to double our business every year for the next three years," Fox said.
But those companies thatdon't have the inherent advantages of a vast product line and experience in the field are taking it slow.
Hoff said that FoxInteractive will not expand rapidly from its eight-person staff. The company will rely on its Fox's video marketing and sales group to perform distribution functions.
"We don't want to build redundant organizations," Hoff said. "It doesn't make sense."
One roadblock, however,is finding enough talent to develop games, Hoff said. The talent pool seems to be centered in the Bay Area, where there is a large concentration of hardware and software developers, he said.
Ultimately, there islikely to be a shakeout for some studios trying to make it in the interactive market, analysts said. Right now, independent developers such as Broderbund Software in Novato, makers of the game "Myst," are taking in the most money.
"Right now it's like anempty bag for everybody," said Jeffrey Logsdon, analyst for the Seidler Cos. in Los Angeles. "(Some studios) have some cookies in the bag. The guys that have the big submarine sandwiches are not the studios."
Logsdon said there are alarge number of multimedia computers on the market now. It remains unclear how much consumers will invest in extensive software titles.
