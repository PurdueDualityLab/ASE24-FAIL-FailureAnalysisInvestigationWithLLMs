The Movie Was a Hit, The CD-ROM a Dud; Software Bites Disney --- `Lion King' Glitches Show Just How Far Hollywood Is From Silicon Valley

Parents don't like surprises when they are buying products for their children. They pass over alien-looking goods for the comfortable, the familiar, the trustworthy. This is Walt Disney Co.'s domain, and the company's sacred pact with parents has built a $10 billion corporation.
So when three-year-old Cailin Flaherty dissolved into tears on Christmas morning, it was the kind of event that shakes Disney to its foundations. Like thousands of other children who found Disney's "The Lion King" CD-ROM under the tree, she was disappointed when her dad couldn't get the program to work on the family computer: Video would freeze midframe.
Dad, a software specialist with a relatively powerful computer, wasn't too pleased, either, when Disney took weeks to respond to his repeated requests to fix the problem. The company last Friday promised Terry Flaherty a technician would be in touch.
"We regret that customers have had incompatibility problems and we are 100% committed to customer satisfaction," says Steve McBeth, president of Disney Interactive, the company's software arm. "We won't be satisfied until all compatibility problems are removed." The disk so far is only sold in North America, but Disney intends to roll it out in Europe this spring.
How could Disney -- king of children's entertainment and moviedom's reigning box-office leader -- fumble at what would seem to be its own game? The answer is a study not only in Disney corporate culture but also in Hollywood's awkward flirtations with computer technology. As Cailin Flaherty's distress and similar problems in thousands of households make painfully clear, multimedia is more lion's play than children's.
Though Disney has a reputation for cutting-edge technology in its animated films and theme-park rides, the Disney Software unit -- opened with great fanfare in 1989 -- never met financial expectations. Now, however, Disney executives say the company will build its software division, recently renamed Disney Interactive, to a $1 billion business within five years.
Disney and others are pinning much of their hope on CD-ROMs, the silvery compact disks that store huge amounts of digital data, enough to produce acceptable color motion pictures and sound on computers. Already 7.8 million home computers are thought to have the equipment that can read these disks, three times the number of just a year ago, according to industry consultant Dataquest Inc.
But in practice, an unknown amount of this equipment already is obsolete. And standards needed for software to mesh smoothly with home equipment are foggy. Disney, which had such success selling the "Lion King" CD-ROM, discovered painfully that it was another thing to make it work.
Disney pounced on the CD-ROM market with a huge $3 million advertising campaign timed to the re-release of the highest grossing animated film of all time. Disney pumped almost 300,000 units of the "Lion King" into Wal-Marts and Kmarts throughout the U.S., and overnight produced the fastest-selling children's title ever. Consumers have bought more than 200,000 to date.
The venom only set in Dec. 26, and continued to build as angry consumer messages went unanswered for days and weeks. Mr. Flaherty's missive was just one of thousands pouring into Disney by mail, phone and computer. "Is anybody out there?" asked a plaintive user on one computer-service board operated by Disney. Other messages complained of fundamental broken trust and corporate arrogance. "My whole family has a tarnished image of Disney right now," said an angry note. Still other writers threatened to cancel plans to visit Walt Disney World.
As company officials now concede, the program was marketed with known errors, wrongly believed to affect only a minute percentage of computers. Also, a misjudgment was made that allowed "Lion King" to run only on computers with up-to-date sound equipment. (Other versions are now being sent to disappointed buyers.) But pressed by the approach of Christmas and the re-release of the film, Disney released the CD-ROM.
As with other home-computer programs published by Disney, technical work on "Lion King" was done by an outside contractor. Closely held Media Station Inc. of Ann Arbor, Michigan, used an elaborate "software engine" of its own design to stitch together sound and drawings by Disney artists. Final quality assurance was Disney's job. Disney says it was told by both Media Station and Microsoft Corp., which had produced sections of the software code, of the program's bugs.
When "Lion King" works, users find the elegant coloring and slickly drawn characters of the Disney movie. The tale of Simba the lion, whose father, king of beasts, dies and who fights an evil uncle to regain his father's throne, is told in the digested form of an electronic storybook.
Opinions of the 18 screens of narrative and three interactive games vary. In informal testing at Home PC magazine, "it was clear that children love `Lion King'; it was also clear that the love began before they sat down with the program," reports Carol Ellison, editor. Some home users have a different view. "I got the program to work after spending $300 to upgrade our computer," says Charles Hammerslough, who bought the program for his young daughter for Christmas. "After all of that, it was a bit of a yawner."
Though glitches are widespread throughout the software industry, Disney's approach with "Lion King" says much about its lingering unfamiliarity with the business. Companies specializing in children's computer programs generally go to considerable lengths to settle problems, having learned the hard way about parental angst and anger.
While "Lion King" buyers waited days and even weeks for help, at least one children's software company kept support lines open even Christmas Day, anticipating an influx of calls. "People were thrilled that we were there," says Larry Gross, vice president of consumer satisfaction and co-founder of children's software maker Knowledge Adventure Inc. of La Crescenta, California. Disney's support board opened the day after Christmas with an expanded staff but was overloaded instantly, company officials say. A toll-free number, opened days later, was swamped as well.
Disney's experience has hardly discouraged it from further adventures in software. Disney Interactive by the end of this year expects to have 300 employees, up from about 125 currently. Unsaid publicly are even more striking plans to build a fullfledged software operation within the Disney organization. Bit by bit, Disney insiders say, the actual writing of software -- long disdained as a technical task best assigned to subcontractor and licensees -- will be brought in-house.
Yet, can a full-scale, independent-minded software unit last in the very different culture of a Hollywood enterprise? Mr. McBeth says yes -- that Disney has come to understand that in order to make successful multimedia software, it needs to treat the technical aspects of software programming as an art.
"We're at a critical juncture in the CD-ROM business, when it ceases to be a fringe business and becomes a core business," says Peter Black, founder of Xiphias, a software developer in Los Angeles.
Time will tell whether the Lion King's creator has learned the lessons of the multimedia jungle. From within, Disney executives somewhat wearily contend that, whatever Disney does, its work will be carefully scrutinized.
"We're very visible," says Richard H. Frank, chairman of Walt Disney Television and Telecommunications, one of the corporate arms overseeing Disney Interactive. "That's why people are happy to point to our problems."
