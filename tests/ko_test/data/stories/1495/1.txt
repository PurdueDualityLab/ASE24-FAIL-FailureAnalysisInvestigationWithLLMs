burbank, calif. Recovering from a digital glitch that left the entertainment giant the target of a cyberspace assault, Walt Disney Co. last week pledged to be better prepared for next Christmas' software crunch. Disney Interactive was flamed by online consumers over the holiday season when it experienced trouble running "Disney's Animated Storybook: The Lion King" and the "Aladdin Activity Center" CD-ROMs on their home PCs. The technical problems were exacerbated by what many consumers called poor customer support. (See Editorial, page 14) Disney Interactive, based here, responded to consumer complaints about the CD-ROMS not working (or, in some cases, crashing computers) by setting up additional toll-free telephone lines and a voice-mail system, and adding freelance technical support staff between Christmas and New Year's Day.
Delays, however, were long and online answers to technical questions were often routed to personal electronic mail, rather than answered publicly in online forums so that the information could be easily shared. Steve Fields, Disney Interactive's senior vice president of multimedia, said the company will add customer-support personnel over the next year. "We will spend a lot of energy this year enhancing and building the capabilities of our technical-support system," Fields said. In addition, Fields said the Disney interactive unit is planning a marketing campaign next fall to encourage parents to set up their multimedia CD-ROMs and software prior to Christmas Day. Fields attributed the problem to the high volume of CD-ROM sales: more than 200,000 "Lion King" and 100,000 "Aladdin" disks were sold over the holiday. He estimated that more than half those copies were opened on Christmas Day, many in households with new computer users. The combination added up to a technical service department flooded with phone calls and consumers doing a slow burn. "This is an industry-wide problem," Fields said. "I believe we were an example of the problem because of the volume of units and the fact they were all opened at once."
