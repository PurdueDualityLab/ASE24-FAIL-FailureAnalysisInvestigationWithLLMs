'System error. Sharing violation on drive c:.'
Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of children saw this bewildering message on computer screens Christmas morning instead of Simba the lion cub.
'Disney's Animated Storybook: The Lion King,' a heavily promoted children's CD-ROM for personal computers running Windows, contained a number of software bugs that generated incomprehensible error messages -- such as the one reproduced above. But that wasn't the only problem. Many buyers didn't bother to read the fine print on 'The Lion King' box and didn't realize they needed sophisticated hardware to run the CD-ROM.
The gap between what computer owners know about their machines and what the software industry expects them to know is widening, with 'The Lion King' fiasco representing only one small example of what's wrong.
The dilemma: Personal computers, despite massive strides in the last decade, are still complex machines. The first buyers of home PCs were techno- savvy 'early adopters' who were willing to puzzle through difficult software installation procedures, download 'patch' files from on-line services to fix buggy products and slog through arcane documentation to figure out how programs work.
The second wave of PC owners, most of whom have bought their first machine in the last two years, are very different. They see computers as tools -- much like a toaster or a videocassette recorder -- that should immediately perform useful functions without asking the user to spend hours reading an instruction manual. 'The Lion King,' for example, required a 16-bit sound board, a relatively new piece of hardware that's only been widely available for the last 18 months. Many home computers, equipped with older 8-bit sound boards, couldn't run the CD-ROM.
Home computer users often don't understand the importance of checking hardware specifications when buying software and don't know all the details of their system configuration. Disney didn't exactly help customers overcome this hurdle -- the technical specifications were only listed in tiny print on the bottom of 'The Lion King' box.
'You shouldn't have to know anything -- just that you've been to the movie and this would be a cool thing for my kid,' declares Robert Strom, owner of a bicycle shop in Tucson, Ariz., and a disappointed owner of 'The Lion King'.
Strom said his wife bought the CD-ROM for their 5-year-old daughter without realizing a 16-bit sound board was required. The couple is waiting for a replacement version of the disk that will run with the 8-bit sound board on the family PC. Every time the postal carrier comes down the street, Strom adds, his daughter asks if 'The Lion King' has finally arrived.
This type of frustration is likely to increase as new users arrive in ever increasing numbers, threatening to swamp the industry's already overtaxed telephone support staffs. Bruce Ryon, a computer industry analyst with the research firm Dataquest Inc. in San Jose, estimates 1 million consumers bought their first home PC in 1994, up from 200,000 in 1993. The figure will be even higher in 1995, Ryon adds, although he hasn't yet made a final projection.
'The industry is sprinting to catch up,' adds Chris LeTocq, president of Softtracks Software Research in Los Altos. 'They know they have a problem.'
The Learning Company, a relatively small developer of children's software in Fremont, maintains a staff of 28 people to answer phone calls from confused customers. About a third of those calls, according to marketing vice president John Stacey, aren't directly related to Learning Company products -- instead, the callers want basic advice on how to set up their computers. But the staff still answers all the questions.
'The issue to us is making sure people have a good experience, so they come back again and again,' Stacey explains. 'We're trying to make sure the category (of children's software) continues to grow.'
Hardware manufacturers, meanwhile, are having the same experience in reverse. Michael Culver, senior director of product management for Acer America Corp. in San Jose, says more than half the calls his company receives are from owners of Acer computers who have questions about software. Some software is so difficult to install, Culver adds, that up to 50 percent of the units sold are returned for a refund -- although he diplomatically declined to give any names. 'Ultimately, the marketplace votes with its feet and its pocketbook,' Culver declared. In other words, both hardware and software companies with products that are difficult to install or operate won't survive in the new era of mass-market computing.
Meeting the needs of new users means developing software that installs effortlessly and then explains itself.
Failing to meet these needs can potentially unleash a torrent of phone calls -- more than any company could handle no matter how many operators it hires.
'You don't want to put the onus on the consumer to figure it out,' says Eric Docter, director of corporate marketing for Vantive Corp. in Mountain View, which develops computer systems for running customer support departments. 'There's a tremendous shift right now in trying to understand the concept of customer service.'
According to one software executive, who asked not to be identified, Microsoft Corp. and several other large companies are exploring the idea of setting up a joint customer service center. Any company participating in the project would give customers the same toll-free 800 number to reach a staff of people trained in dealing with a wide range of problems.
Despite these efforts, however, the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better. Rapid changes in hardware will prevent a standard platform from emerging for home use, so inexperienced home computer users are likely to continue having the frustration of buying software that won't work on their particular systems.
The situation may improve in a few years, however, if there is widespread acceptance of Microsoft's new 'Windows 95' operating system and an emerging industry standard called 'plug and play.'
Windows 95 promises to do a much better job of managing a computer's internal resources than the outdated DOS operating system, making it easier for software developers to create programs that can be installed without any input from users. Plug and play is a proposal to create standards for peripherals such as CD-ROM drives, sound cards and video boards so that novice users can expand their systems without having to change any internal settings. Also, software would be able to automatically connect with plug and play components, eliminating the type of glitches that undermined 'The Lion King.'
