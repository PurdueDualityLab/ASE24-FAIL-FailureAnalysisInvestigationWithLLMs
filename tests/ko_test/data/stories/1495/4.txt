Media Station's first independent CD-ROM title, Haunted Hotel, aimed at 6-yr-olds and over
ANN ARBOR, Mich. -- After successfully teaming up with heavy hitters in the entertainment software industry including Disney Interactive and Philips Interactive Media, Media Station, the thirty-employee software design and production company based here, wants some of the spotlight to itself.
Media Station, headed by founder, president and artistic director David Gregory, has garnered industrywide recognition for its groundbreaking animation technology and scored music productions. (Gregory is also a composer.)
The company's best known project to date is Disney Interactive's Animated StoryBook: The Lion king CD-ROM, which it designed in a joint venture with Disney Interactive. In addition to creating some 12,000 frames of digital animation and having a significant hand in the musical composition and arrangement, Media Station used its Win Toon software component (a technology the company originally licensed to Microsoft) which allows for the highest level of animation to run in Windows.
Disney has been taking over the 'Christmas bug' in The Lion King CD-ROM. Gregory said the technology glitch was 'in 90 percent of the cases, a video driver problem,' and that Disney and Microsoft have been providing a video upgrade to all users.
Disney Interactive plans to release in April Disney's Animated StoryBook: Winnie The Pooh and the Honey Tree, also co-designed with Media Station.
After signing a development agreement with Philips Interactive Media in 1994, Media Station designed Lambchop Loves Music, starring Shari Lewis, and Jan Pienkowski's Haunted House, for the company. Both will be released by Philips this year.
The company's two children's titles with HarperCollins Interactive -- George Shrinks, for Windows, and If You Give a Mouse a Cookie, for Macintosh -- were released Christmas 1994.
'To become a big player, you have to go into partnerships,' said Gregory. 'We've teamed up with some of the best. Working with Disney has given us the chance to work with the greatest content possible, and the challenge of living up to their standards. It's gotten our name in the channels. With Philips we had more creative freedom.'
Media Station now has five titles in production simultaneously. 'It's definitely our intention to shift toward publishing our own titles as much as possible,' Gregory said.
Media Station's first independent title is Haunted Hotel, aimed at audiences aged 6 and older. It will be available in the fall of 1995.
While 12 to 15 titles a year seems to be the average output many CD-ROM publishers are pushing these days, Media Station is taking a more measured approach to bringing titles to market. 'The key word is quality not quantity,' said Tom Stanton, director of Marketing.
'Even Microsoft doesn't have the marketing know-how to support the amount of titles they're rolling out this year,' said Gregory. 'I think the distribution models are going to change. Right now we're looking to build our brand name and get guarantees on shelf space. We want to be there during the shakeout.'
