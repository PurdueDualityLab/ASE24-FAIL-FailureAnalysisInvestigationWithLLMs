Apr. 27--Time Warner Cable is going nationwide with a cell phone service it had been testing in the Triangle since November.
The product, called Pivot, allows Time Warner customers to use their cell phone to access their Time Warner Road Runner e-mail, News 14 live TV footage and home voice mail. Pivot is a joint venture between Time Warner and Sprint Nextel and sold at Sprint Nextel kiosks and by the cable company.
Time Warner has been testing Pivot in Raleigh and Austin, Texas, since November, with about 100 people in each market.
Raleigh resident Pete Harris signed up three months ago.
He said there have been some glitches like friends not being able to leave voice mail and a few billing problems, but that they were taken care of quickly.
"When football comes around here in another couple months, it's definitely going to be worth having," he said.
This week, Pivot is being introduced in Kansas City and San Antonio, with plans for a nationwide introduction to Time Warner's 16 million customers before the end of the year.
The partnership with Sprint is a strategic bid for Time Warner to tap into the cell phone market, said Chris Van Name, Time Warner's vice president of sales and new market development for the Carolina region.
Wireless service has been the missing piece for the dominant cable provider in the Triangle, in the movement toward a convergence. Time Warner offers home phone service, Internet and television.
"For us to enter into the wireless business, why not partner with someone already in the business and has a customer base?" he said.
Customers can bundle the cell phone service with the rest of their Time Warner services and add it to their existing Time Warner bills. The service will add between $30 and $50 to their monthly bills.
Time Warner will start marketing campaigns soon and is planning to add new features. For instance, by the end of the year, Pivot customers will be able to use their cell phones to program their digital video recorders remotely.
