Apr. 27--Some Time Warner digital-cable customers went into a second day with limited or no service yesterday, as a computer glitch continued to disable set-top digital boxes.
They were also frustrated by the difficulty of getting through to Time Warner's customer service department.
"I have tried repeatedlyto contact someone and their phone lines are busy," John Holland, a customer in western Forsyth County, wrote in an e-mail.
He said he also was mad that the company's Web site didn't have any information about the problem.
"This is poor customerservice," Holland wrote. "I spend over $200 per month ... and have been concerned over the rates. With this, it makes me start looking at other options."
Phone lines at TimeWarner were overwhelmed by the volume of calls, said Buck Yarborough at Time Warner's Greensboro division office. The company got close to 24,000 calls and engaged another call center to help with the overflow, but it still could not handle the volume.
The problem began early Wednesday, when Time Warner and Scientific Atlanta, the vendor that supplies the digital set-top boxes, were working on a software upgrade that would speed up some services.
The glitch, whichYarborough described as "an unforeseen catastrophic failure," caused customers in the western part of Time Warner's Triad coverage area -- Forsyth, Yadkin, Surry, Davidson and Davie counties -- to lose service. There are about 51,000 digital cable subscribers in that area.
"Not all of those saw aproblem, but a significant number did," Yarborough said. Engineers worked around the clock trying to fix the problem. By late yesterday afternoon, about 5,000 were still without service. The company hopes to have nearly ever customer's service restored by this morning.
Customers will bereimbursed based on the amount of time they did not have digital cable service, with an automatic credit applied to their account. The credits could total as much as $200,000, Yarborough said.
"We've already begun atop-to-bottom review of this whole situation," Yarborough said, "to make sure it doesn't happen again."
