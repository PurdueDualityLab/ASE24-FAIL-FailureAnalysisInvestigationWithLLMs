Alex toasts change in luck
WHEN Alex McLeish gave a clear indication that he planned to celebrate his Old Firm triumph in the traditional way by raising a glass or two, he underlined how Rangers are returning to their roots.
The Hampden success was the first time a Scottish manager has won an Old Firm match since Rangers overcame Celtic 2-0 under Walter Smith nearly four years ago.
Now, the next step for the new manager is to further restore the reputation of that institution on the wider European front.
The two UEFA Cup clashes with Dutch side Feyenoord later this month beckon, and McLeish's preparation for them is beginning.
He said: "I have already watched Feyenoord on video in a number of games and I also hope to get some inside information from our Dutch contingent.
"Already I know they are a decent team with a set system and a settled side.
"I believe we have a good chance of overcoming them over two legs, but also know their reaction to the draw was that a pairing with Rangers was a good one one for them.
"Of course I know one or two of their players, Pierre Van Hooijdonk and Jon Dahl Tomasson, in particular.
"They rely on those two for their goals, and they will take a bit of watching over the two games."
It is his own players though that will get most of McLeish's attention as he attempts to ring the changes and please as many people for as much of the time as is possible.
However, the former Hibs man claimed their was to substance to an allegded bust-up between him and Michael Mols.
He said: "There has been no fall out between Michael and I.
"But with these matches against Feyenoord coming up we could get knocks and Michael could come back into the frame."
Meanwhile, Gers youngster Stephen Hughes believes his side's CIS Insurance Cup clash against Celtic will have taken its toll, but will not use it as an excuse for failing to win games.
They travel to Tynecastle today when league business resumes against Hearts but Hughes insists Alex McLeish has a big enough squad to cope with such a busy period.
"Every game is hard from here on in but going to Tynecastle is always a difficult one," he said.
"However, we have a big enough squad to cope with it and we should still be winning every week," he told the Rangers website, www.rangers.co.uk[http://www.rangers.co.uk/].
The good news for Rangers is that defender Lorenzo Amoruso should be able to take part against Hearts despite having five stitches in a thigh gash he received against Celtic.
But Hearts will be without Alan Maybury - as a result of a Scottish Football Association computer error.
The Republic of Ireland player should have completed his two-match suspension against Dunfermline last week but a computer glitch means he was able to play in that game but misses out in today's game.
