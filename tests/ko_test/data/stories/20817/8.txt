A COMPUTER glitch has ruled former Republic of Ireland under-21 defender Alan Maybury out of his dream date with his boyhood heroes Rangers.
Maybury, who has been a regular for Hearts since moving to Scotland from Leeds United last October, is out of the home clash against the Glasgow giants on Saturday.
The 23-year-old Dubliner was sent-off against Livingston on January 19 - and he was supposed to complete a two-match ban in the 1- 1 draw with Dunfermline last weekend.
However, the SFA failed to inform the club that he wasn't eligible - and he played in that game.
And SFA spokesman said: "The dismissal against Livingston took the player through the threshold and meant he had to serve a two-match ban.
"However, due to a hiccup in the computer system this only came to light at the end of last week.
"We had two systems up and running at the same time and it wasn't noticed until Friday afternoon.
"But because it wasn't any fault of Hearts we didn't want to disrupt their preparations for the game at Dunfermline at such short notice.
"Alan Maybury therefore still has one game of his suspension to serve and will now do so when Hearts play Rangers on Saturday at Tynecastle."
Hearts manager Craig Levein added: "It is not ideal, but we will just get on with things and prepare accordingly for Saturday."
The big Edinburgh clash is scheduled for this Saturday tea time at 5.35 and will be shown live by Sky. Illustration
