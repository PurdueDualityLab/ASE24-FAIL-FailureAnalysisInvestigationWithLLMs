ALAN'S DOSE OF THE BLUES OVER BEAKS' BLUNDER
BUNGLING beaks have wrecked Hearts star Alan Maybury's dream date with Rangers on Saturday.
The Irish ace hoped to push his claim for a World Cup slot in the live Sky game and his family in Dublin planned to tune in for a rare glimpse of him in action.
But the former Leeds star was shattered when the SFA told him he was banned for the game because they had blundered by clearing him to play in last Saturday's 1-1 draw at Dunfermline.
Now Maybury, who sat out the 2-0 defeat by Celtic at Parkhead last month as the first of a two-game ban for a red card against Livingston, has to serve the second half of his suspension when Gers travel to Tynecastle.
Maybury said: 'It's very disappointing. I missed the Celtic game as the first match of the ban and now I'll miss the Rangers game -two of the biggest matches of the season.
Disappointing
'It's especially disappointing as my folks back home don't get to see much of Hearts.'
The SFA claim a computer glitch led to the boob over Maybury's ban.
A spokesman said: 'The player was serving a two-match ban but due to a hiccup in the computer system it wasn't noticed until Friday.
'As it wasn't Hearts' fault, we didn't want to interrupt their preparations for the Dunfermline match at short notice.
'Alan Maybury therefore still has one game of his suspension to serve and will do so on Saturday.'
