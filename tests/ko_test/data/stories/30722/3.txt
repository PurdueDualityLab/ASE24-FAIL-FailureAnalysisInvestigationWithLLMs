DENVER (AP) - A glitch-plagued computer designed to handle food stamps, Medicare and other state benefits has dropped some clients, slowed new applications to a crawl and crashed in its first week of use, county officials said.
State officials said they rearranged some computer hardware over the weekend to improve the computer's speed and are attacking other problems as they pop up.
Gov. Bill Owens ordered the $199 million system into operation on Sept. 1 over the protests of some county officials, who said it was not ready.
The computer inadvertently dropped 1,500 people from Medicaid, said Rocky Mountain Health Plans, which handles health insurance for the affected people. State officials promised to resolve the problem quickly, a Rocky Mountain Health Plans spokeswoman said.
The computer system crashed in Mesa County on Tuesday, officials said.
Tom Papin, Mesa County's director of human services, blamed the computer on delays in issuing some food stamps, saying his staff had to override the system to get clients their benefits.
"I think the state forgot there are real people, real families and real crisis situations out here," he said.
State officials contend the computer isn't to blame for the food stamp delays, saying the benefits in question would have been processed by the old system.
Mesa County officials have said it sometimes takes 45 minutes for the computer to advance from one page to the next in the application process.
State contractors realigned computer processors last weekend to better handle the volume of data, said Rhonda Bentz, spokeswoman for the state Department of Health Care Policy and Financing, which oversees the computer.
The computer was working faster this week than last, said Richard Rowe, Weld County public assistance manager.
