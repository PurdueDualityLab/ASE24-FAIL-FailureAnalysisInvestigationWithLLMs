New state computer blamed for delays in food stamps

Up to 400 families in Mesa County have not yet received their September food stamps, and a county official blamed glitches in a state computer system that went online Wednesday over the protests of some welfare administrators.
State officials said Saturday the September food stamps were processed under the old system and that the new one was likely not to blame.
'The reality is that the (new) system is not ready,' county human services director Tom Papin said.
Papin said about 10 percent of Mesa County's 4,000 food stamp clients had not received their benefits by Friday and said the problem could get worse.
Gov. Bill Owens ordered state officials to begin using the new system on Sept. 1 despite objections from administrators in some counties that it wasn't ready. Owens directed that $2 million in federal funds be given to counties to help them implement the system.
The system, in development since 1996, is designed to handle food stamps and several other benefits programs, including cash assistance for needy adults, Colorado Works employment and cash assistance, children's health plans, child welfare and some Medicaid benefits.
An advocacy group sued the state in Denver District Court last week over the new system. Some welfare recipients and advocacy groups argued that false information had to be entered into the computer to ensure eligible recipients got benefits.
For example, they said, county workers were told to enter Hawaii as the issuing state for an applicant's driver's license if the applicant was from another country. The computer will not accept non-U.S. driver's licenses, even though some eligible food stamp recipients are legal immigrants from Canada or Mexico.
Papin told the Grand Junction Sentinel that state officials had provided a list of such 'work-arounds' to circumvent similar problems.
'That's providing false information, ultimately, to the federal government,' Papin said. 'I can't ask my staff to do that or risk somebody's benefits.'
Papin also said it can take 45 minutes for the computer to move from one page to the next when processing a new application.
'That's unacceptable,' he said.
State Department of Human Services spokeswoman Liz McDonough said the agency expects 'bumps in the road' with the new system but said they would have to be worked through.
Owens spokesman Dan Hopkins said Saturday he had not heard about the Mesa County problem but did not believe the new computer was responsible.
Last week Hopkins disputed one estimate from Fremont County that the system had a 37 percent failure rate in test runs.
He said backups were in place to make sure no one missed benefits if the system had problems.
