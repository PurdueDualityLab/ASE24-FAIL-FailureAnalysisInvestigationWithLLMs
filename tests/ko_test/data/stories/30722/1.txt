In its first three days, the state's new computer system that processes applications for food stamps, Medicaid and other assistance programs made serious mistakes and at times slowed almost to a halt, leaving some caseworkers in tears and applicants facing long delays.
Clients and public health nurses in Mesa County are complaining about missing checks and food stamps. And the system inadvertently dropped 1,500 people enrolled in Medicaid through Rocky Mountain Health Plans.
A Rocky Mountain Health Plans spokeswoman said the state has assured that the problem will be corrected soon.
But Tuesday afternoon, the system crashed completely in Mesa County, and apparently across the state.
Over the weekend, state contractors had redirected processors within the Colorado Benefits Management System hardware to better handle the volume.
'Two processors were moved to where they should have been to speed up the system,' said Rhonda Bentz, spokeswoman for the state's Department of Health Care Policy and Financing.
She said system designers tried to anticipate where those processors would be needed, but miscalculated.
Richard Rowe, Weld County's public assistance manager, said Tuesday, 'We are seeing the system moving considerably quicker than it did last week.'
The $199 million system was intended to streamline the process of applying for state assistance programs. Most who work with those programs agree the idea is a good one. But county officials have complained that the system is riddled with errors and will cost too much to implement.
As a result of a lawsuit, a judge ordered the state to fix one glitch in the system that forces caseworkers to supply false information to proceed. The state is still working on those fixes, Bentz said. Even before the crash, human services staff around the state say, they have been able to process only a fraction of the usual number of applications for assistance since CBMS went online Sept. 1.
Last week, Joanne Hine sat at her computer at the Mesa County Department of Human Services and cried as she tried to fill out online applications for clients needing cash assistance.
Each time she had to change screens, the wait was up to 45 minutes. If she left her computer during the wait, she was kicked off the system.
'I can't stand the way I feel - that I can't help my clients,' the social service intake specialist said Tuesday as she waited on a computer system that was completely nonfunctional.
'This system is not ready for prime time,' said Tom Papin, director of the county's Human Services Department. 'I think the state forgot there are real people, real families and real crisis situations out here.'
The real test, county officials across the state say, will come Oct. 1, when the first month's batch of payments made through CBMS is scheduled to go out.
