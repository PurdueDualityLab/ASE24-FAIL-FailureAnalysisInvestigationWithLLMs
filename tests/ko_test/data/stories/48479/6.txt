A steady stream of con jobs?

Early this week a Boston Herald investigation revealed that nearly 4,000 murderers and rapists received $250 checks from the Obama administration's $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.
The convict windfall totaled approximately $1 million nationwide, according to the Herald report.
While the amount doesn't seem like much measured against the massive stimulus bill, it makes us wonder what other fraudulent mistakes might be in the process of being perpetrated on the U.S. taxpayer.
The inspector general of Social Security is now investigating how the convicts were mailed the checks, since they didn't qualify for Social Security or any other benefit program that would trigger participation in the stimulus package.
The newspaper report has also sparked a broader investigation. Federal officials are checking into reports that improper payment might have been sent to dead beneficiaries and recipients no longer legally authorized to live in the United States.
At least 24 convicts who received improper payments are from Massachusetts. One is an inmate serving a life sentence without parole for first-degree murder. Five were convicted of rape and one of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.
If they weren't receiving Social Security in the first place, how did the federal government get an ID number to send the convicts a $250 check?
If the ID number is fraudulent -- and it probably is -- how many other unqualified recipients could be using the same illegal means to scam the system?
We hope this is an aberration, and a computer glitch caused the problem. On the other hand, we are extremely wary of any massive government-run program where the details are often the last resort.
Congress approved the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in haste. Few lawmakers admitted to reading the 1,100 pages of legislation. It was promoted as an urgent need to keep America's financial institutions solvent and functioning and to stimulate economic activity from consumers.
Initial reports are mixed as to the program's success. Stimulus money for infrastructure improvements has been slow to arrive in states like Massachusetts, where the jobless rate continues to climb. Banks and other financial institutions have either refused participation or returned government funding because of restrictions placed on employee compensation.
Gov. Deval Patrick, in a Sun interview, was hard-pressed to account for new jobs created from stimulus funding in Massachusetts.
We can just imagine in the weeks ahead what might emerge from a government audit of its $3 billion Cash-for-Clunkers program.
It's easy to see why Americans might be suspicious and angry over Washington's push for a health-care overhaul that would diminish the role now played by private insurers: Deserving people often find themselves fighting tooth-and-nail with the government for what is truly theirs while the cons and illegal aliens get it without even asking.
