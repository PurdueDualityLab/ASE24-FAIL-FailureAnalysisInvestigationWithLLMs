Im sure it stimulated something, but I dont think it did much to stimulate the economy. Well, that could be said of the whole oestimulus bill.
Im talking about the convicts who received tax money from you and me (that our children will be paying off) as part of the porkulus package.
From Fox News:
The federal government mistakenly sent out stimulus checks to 1,700 inmates, the Social Security Administration said Tuesday ' a $425,000 error.
Social Security spokesman Dan Moraski told FOXNews.com in a written statement that the money went out because official records oedid not accurately reflect that they were in prison.
The inspector generals office for the Social Security Administration is now looking into the problem as part of its broader audit on stimulus spending. The Social Security Administration acknowledged the glitch following a report that nearly two-dozen inmates in Massachusetts had wrongly received the $250 stimulus checks
And this is the same government some people think should be running our health care?
