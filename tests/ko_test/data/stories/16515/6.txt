Dell Deliveries...
Big CD Sound... NO WAITING FOR GATEWAY PCS
Impatient Gateway PC buyers can buy new machines from Gateway stores today, as the company temporarily abandons its made-to-order tradition. For the first time in company history, customers can purchase computers straight from one of Gateway's 320 Country Stores. It's a marketing effort intended to combat sluggish PC sales industry-wide. PC Data reported November PC sales down 15% over last year, and Gateway reported a 30% drop in Thanksgiving Holiday sales over the previous year. The store sales run through Dec. 24 and involve only the three most popular Gateway systems: Essential 700 for $799, Essential 866 Digital Photo PC for $1,299, and Select 1000 Digital Music PC for $1,599.
PROBLEMS DELAY DELL DELIVERIES
Some shoppers won't have that new PC or laptop under the Christmas tree as Dell Computer experiences trouble delivering on its top consumer systems. The problem affects the two top consumer models: Dimension 8100 PC and Inspiron 8000 notebook. According to Dell, the two models have separate problems. With the Dimension 8100, a Web ordering glitch allowed customers to order a USB keyboard and mouse that are incompatible. Supply problems with 8X CD-RW drives and 32MB graphics cards are the culprits slowing Inspiron 8000 orders. It's a bad scene, say analysts. With consumer PC sales down anywhere from 18% to 30% from last holiday season, Dell cannot afford to leave sales on the table, especially its high-profile, high-margin consumer systems.
NEW TECHNOLOGY DELIVERS BIG SOUND
Texas Instruments has developed an all-digital sound system that its says delivers top quality sound to portable CD players, personal computers and car stereos. The breakthrough involves combining its new digital amplifiers with a TI core product - digital signal processors (DSP). The two technologies convert real-world sound and images to digital form that computers can handle, says TI. The digital sound system fits on a hand sized circuit board and replaces the bulkier, noisier analog amplifiers. Another upside: When it ships, it should add only hundreds rather than thousands of dollars to audio devices.
