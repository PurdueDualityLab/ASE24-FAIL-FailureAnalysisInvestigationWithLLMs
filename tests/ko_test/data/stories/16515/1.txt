Dell struggles with delivery

Dell Computer customers who placed their order for computer systems may not get their order in time for Christmas.
Dell is backed up in getting its top systems -- the Dimension 8100 PC and Inspiron 8000 notebook -- to customers.
Dell spokesman Tom Kehoe said Monday that about five per cent of orders taken on Dimension 8100 are affected. He would not say how many customers that included.
Kehoe said he did not know how many customers had been affected by the delay of the Inspiron 8000 notebook either, but added that the problem has been fixed.
'This is obviously mis-execution by Dell and frankly it's quite dangerous,' said Gartner analyst Kevin Knox. 'People went to Dell all the way back in November and if they can't deliver product before Christmas, this is going to leave a bad taste in a lot of people's mouths.'
The problem in getting the Dimension 8100 to customers stems from a glitch on the Dell ordering Web page that allowed customers to order a keyboard and a mouse that are incompatible. Kehoe said Dell has fixed the problem by sending to customers an upgraded version of the mouse that will be compatible with the keyboard they ordered.
Inspiron 8000 orders were slowed by supply problems with 8X CD-RW drives and 32MB graphics cards, causing Dell to have to tell customers that their computer would not be shipped within four days, as normally quoted to customers.
Kehoe said the problem has been straightened out and that customers who place orders on Tuesday will get their computer on time.
