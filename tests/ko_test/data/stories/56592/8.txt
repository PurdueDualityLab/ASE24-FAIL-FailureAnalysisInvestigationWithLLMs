More preteen children arewatching television this fall than last, according to new data from TV-ratings firm Nielsen, raising questions about Viacom Inc.'s contention that a glitch has caused the sharp drop in its Nickelodeon channel's audience.
So far this TV seasonthrough Nov. 20, an average of 5.8 million children between the ages of two and 11 have been watching television at any given minute, including broadcast and cable and live and recorded TV, Nielsen says. That is 1.7% higher than a year earlier.
Meanwhile, Nickelodeonhas been seeing steep declines in viewership among that same age group, which it has long dominated but where it now faces more competition. Hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising revenue for parent Viacom hinge on the audience and on whether long-running shows like "SpongeBob SquarePants" can still hold onto their audiences, and whether new series like "Kung Fu Panda" can build new ones.
Nielsen's data paint abroad picture of how kids' overall TV-watching may be shifting amid a whirlwind of technological changes and a new competitive landscape. While Nielsen's numbers show more children viewing TV in total than a year ago, slightly fewer are watching during the day and more are watching shows on nonkids networks, Nielsen says. The Nielsen data also reflect a bigger Hispanic audience, with 4.6% more Hispanic TV households this fall than last.
At Nickelodeon, Nielsen'sdata show an accelerating decline. An average of 969,000 kids between age two and 11, a group of particular interest to many advertisers, watched the channel in September, down 11% from a year earlier. In October, the drop was 17%, and in the first three weeks of November it steepened to 19% from a year earlier.
Viacom Chief Executive Philippe Dauman disclosed the issue when reporting Viacom'sSeptember-quarter earnings earlier this month. At that time he described the declines as "inexplicable" and noted that data from some cable set-top boxes were showing "meaningfully different" trends.
He also said thatNickelodeon is rolling out fresh episodes of TV shows, including 500 original episodes in the coming year, to boost its numbers.
Nielsen Holdings NV said in a statement that it has worked with Viacomto review the ratings, adding that "the review process confirms that our measurement methodology, operations and related reporting processes are working as expected."
Both sides say they areworking with the Media Rating Council, an outside organization that is reviewing the data with the help of auditors. MRC says it expects to complete its work by early December but will release its findings only to Nielsen and Viacom.
Meanwhile, the picture at other channels for children is mixed, with some growing and others slipping.
Walt Disney Co.'sDisney Channel has averaged 924,000 viewers aged two to 11 at any time of day between Aug. 29 and Nov. 20, up 5.9% from a year earlier, the Nielsen data show.
Upstart network The Hub, owned by Hasbro Inc. and Discovery Communications Inc., said its audience among that group jumped more than 50% to 46,000 compared with a year earlier.
Meanwhile, Time Warner Inc.'s Cartoon Network averaged 479,000 viewers two to 11 years old between Aug. 29 and Nov. 20, down 12% from a year earlier, and Disney XD averaged 149,000 in the period, down 1% from a year earlier, Nielsen said.
A Cartoon Network spokesman said he doesn't believe a glitchis behind the decline at his network. Instead, he pointed to the ratings impact of a movie that Cartoon Network aired in October 2010.
