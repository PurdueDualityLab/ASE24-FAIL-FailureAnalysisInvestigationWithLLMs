Nielsen is informing clients of another processing glitch that has been overstating estimates for so-called 'non-HUT' viewing since 2007, MediaPost's MediaDailyNews reported.
Nielsen Holdings NV is informing clients of another processing glitch that has been overstating estimates for so-called 'non-HUT' viewing since 2007, MediaPost's MediaDailyNews reported Dec. 2.
Nielsen management reportedly claims the non-HUT totals have no practical impact on the TV programming or advertising marketplace.
Moreover, Nielsen has assured clients that its most important ratings data, including all program or 'C3' ratings, were not affected by the glitch, and that it is developing a timeline for correcting the faulty non-HUT viewing sources data in its databases, according to the report.
The most recent glitch follows a recent embarrassing episode when the company reportedly informed its clients it had overstated nearly eight months of 'frequency' data in its Npower system.
