Nielsen Corrects TV-Viewing Data

Nielsen Holdings NV said it erred late last month when it reported an overall increase in the number of children watching television this fall, but it continues to be in disagreement with Viacom Inc. over the accuracy of its TV ratings for Viacom's Nickelodeon children's channel.
The TV-ratings giant now estimates the number of children ages 2 to 11 that watched traditional television channels at any given minute this TV season through Nov. 19 fell 2.9% when compared with last fall, rather than rising 1.7%, as it had initially indicated in data prepared for The Wall Street Journal.
Nielsen's prior estimate of the audience increase, reported by the Journal on wsj.com last Monday and in the newspaper's print edition on Tuesday, had put the spotlight on Viacom, which has suffered a recent sharp drop in viewership for Nickelodeon, a big source of ad revenue for the company. Viacom has described that drop as a "glitch." Other TV channels aimed at children haven't experienced similarly steep declines.
Nielsen detected a mistake in the overall-viewing data provided to the Journal after Viacom contacted the ratings company to question its numbers, Nielsen and Viacom executives said. Nielsen explained the error by saying it had neglected to "apply a standard adjustment" to fall 2010 data in order to make it comparable with this fall's numbers.
Despite the revision to the data it gave the Journal regarding children's overall TV usage, Nielsen says it has detected no problems with its data on Nickelodeon's decline. Nielsen also stands by its data regarding other children's channels, which show an increase for Walt Disney Co.'s Disney Channel and a drop for Time Warner Inc.'s Cartoon Network, albeit a shallower one than for Nickelodeon.
"No underlying data or ratings were affected by this recalculation" of TV usage reported to the Journal, Nielsen said in a written statement. Viacom has sought a review of Nielsen's data with an outside monitor, the Media Rating Council, and Nielsen has been participating in the review.
The debate about Nickelodeon's audience comes at a sensitive time for the channel. The holiday season is typically when marketers target holiday ads to children and their parents. Nomura Securities analyst Michael Nathanson issued a report last Wednesday, after the Journal reported the overall-audience decline, lowering his projection for Viacom's ad-revenue growth. In the final three months of the year, Nickelodeon typically contributes nearly one-quarter of Viacom's overall advertising revenue, he said. Overall, Viacom's media-networks segment, which includes Nickelodeon, reeled in $1.39 billion in advertising revenue in the last three months of 2010, according to securities filings.
The problem with usage data provided to the Journal isn't the only time Nielsen acknowledged a mistake in the past week. Last Wednesday, the company said it informed clients of a software glitch that would double-report usage of devices such as DVD players and videogame consoles when Nielsen clients instructed Nielsen systems to add those figures together. But it said the glitch didn't affect underlying data, nor did it affect ratings for TV channels.
A drop in children watching traditional TV channels comes as the number of all people under 35 years old watching TV channels continues to decline, but time spent at the TV using videogame consoles skyrockets, according to the corrected year-to-year figures provided by Nielsen to the Journal.
But it remains unclear whether those console users were playing games or watching TV or movies on the consoles. Nielsen has been under pressure from media companies to better measure viewing on new platforms.
