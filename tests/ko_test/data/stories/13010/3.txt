A computer glitch at the Texas Supreme Court that delayed 36 cases from being sent to justices for review has been fixed, clerk John Adams says.
The holdup occurred when a computer program that automatically assigns docket numbers to cases based on the year the petition was filed did not recognize 00 as the year 2000.
Adams say the problem was not a true Y2K bug because it was the program, not the computer's clock, that misread the digits.
The glitch was discovered this week when Adams noticed the number of petitions for review had dropped two weeks in a row.
The program was fixed and all of the cases have been forwarded to justices who will decide whether or not the court will hear the appeals, Adams said.
'Everything's cool,' he said.
AUSTIN (AP) - Lt. Gov. Rick Perry will be among the 8,000 runners scheduled to participate Sunday in the Motorola Marathon.
Perry will run the last half of the course, about 13 miles.
Other prominent runners scheduled to race were Attorney General John Cornyn, Coahuila, Mexico Gov. Enrique Martinez y Martinez, Mexican Consul General to Austin Rogelio Gasca Neri and Matt Sanders.
Sanders, 23, of Round Rock was rescued last December after being trapped on a Swiss mountain for six days. He suffered severe frostbite on his feet.
Sanders credits his training for the marathon as one of the reasons he survived in wretched winter weather with only a sleeping back and a backpack of food.
'I'm the type of person that loves challenges, reaching goals and then pushing the limits,' Sanders said.
Running Sunday 'will probably be the hardest thing I have ever attempted, after I cross the finish line the rewards will be priceless and (the) pain will be worth it,' he said.
The Motorola Marathon is a qualifying event for the U.S. Olympic Marathon trials and the Boston Marathon.
AUSTIN (AP) - The Texas Department of Economic Development has named David Teel its new tourism director.
The agency is responsible for promoting the state's tourism activities.
Teel, 40, was the deputy tourism director since 1997. He replaces Tracye McDaniel, who was recently promoted to be deputy executive director of the agency after four years as head of the tourism division.
Teel is a Mexia native and a University of Texas at Austin graduate. He joined the agency in 1992.
The appointment was announced earlier this week.
