C.A. EYE thanks Holly & Art Hughes for this moving observation:
You are SO Lakeland-Somerville when, driving I-40 in rush hour, you believe you can use the HOV lane simply because you have a passenger seat.
WHAT ANNUM IS IT?
If you thought solving the year 2000 computer glitch was going to be tricky, wait till you hear about the year 1999 problem.
Never heard of it? Neither had Marietta Nelson, who now wishes she hadn't.
A reference librarian at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Md. - one of two official U.S. timekeepers - Nelson routinely fields queries from people wondering how to correctly express times and dates.
The Miss Manners of chronology recently received an E-mail asking the following: How do you write the year 1999 in Roman numerals?
Should it be the windy MDCCCCLXXXXVIIII?
The economical MCMXCIX?
Or the snappy MIM? (Memphis in May should glom onto that version for next year).
Finding the answer was tough. After all, Latin may be dead, but the seven Roman numerals - I, V, X, L, C, D, and M - live on in odd corners of the planet. And it all could result in messy, nonstandard usage.
But despite checking with style authorities, architects, movie industry people and old encyclopedias, the results were inconclusive.
"There is no authority on Roman numerals," Nelson said. "There are a lot of theories and opinions and history about how to write them. But to find the date actually written down . . . this is the problem."
Scholars say the rules children learn today are 20th Century conventions, and not necessarily the rules Romans used. For example, children today learn to write the number 9 as IX, which translates as one subtracted from 10. It's a lot more compact than VIIII, which represents 5 plus 4.
"In the earlier period (the Romans) would have spelled out literally everything," says Brian Rose, associate professor of classical architecture at the University of Cincinnati. So Julius Caesar, were he alive today, would date his 1999 checks MDCCCCLXXXXVIIII.
So, how should you write 1999 in Roman numerals?
Nelson finally relied on earlier precedents. Since the number 49, for example, was almost always written as XLIX rather than IL, the government arbiters settled on MCMXCIX for the year 1999.
Of course, there's no argument about what to do when the millennium rolls around. Just date your check MM. And hope there's a bank still open to cash it.
