The new SPIDER-MAN musical has been hit with another setback after actress NATALIE MENDOZA was injured during the first preview performance.
Mendoza, who plays the villainous Arachne, has been ordered out of Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark after she was reportedly struck on the head with a weighted rope backstage during the showing last week (28Nov10).
The star is believed to have suffered concussion and will be replaced by her understudy America Olivo until she is well enough to return.
Producer Michael Cohl says, 'Natalie Mendoza suffered an injury earlier this week and, on doctor's orders, will be out of the show for a brief time. We look forward to welcoming her back very soon.'
Mendoza's accident was just one of the problems that plagued the first preview - the curtain went up late and the show was stopped five times to deal with technical issues.
Bosses have assured fans that all glitches will be smoothed out by the time the comic-book spectacular officially opens in January (11).
