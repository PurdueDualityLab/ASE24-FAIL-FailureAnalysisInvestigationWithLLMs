The Show Must Go On. Disregard The Dangling Actor

The Hotline

The new Broadway musical "Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark" took "flight" 11/28 PM at its first preview performance, "but not without bumps."
"An aerial scene began in Peter Parker’s bedroom to the delight of some audience members — yet it was halted two minutes later with the first of four pauses in Act I, apparently to free the lead actor, Reeve Carney...from an aerial harness."
"The fourth and final pause at the end of Act I was the worst glitch of the night by far." Spider-Man "had just flown and landed onstage" with Mary Jane Watson in his arms. "He was then supposed to zoom off toward the balcony seating area, a few hundred feet away. Instead, a harness and cables lifted Spider-Man several yards up and over the audience, then stopped." Production stage mgr C. Randall White "called for a halt to the show over the sound system, apparently in hopes of fixing and re-doing the stunt."
"Crew members, standing on the stage, spent 45 seconds trying to grab Spider-Man by the foot, as the audience laughed and oohed." When they finally caught him, White "announced intermission, and the house lights came on."
"After the show, several audience members said in interviews that they would hold off on recommending the show to friends until improvements were made" (Healy, New York Times, 11/28).
I'll Have The Lobster, Hold The Tree
In eastern ME, lobster fishermen "erected what they claim is the world's largest Christmas tree made out of lobster traps." The tree-shaped pile of 769 traps "stands 50 feet tall and is adorned with lights and lobster buoys as ornaments" (AP, 11/29).
Pick On Somebody Your Own Age
Lois Speelman, a 100-year-old woman who works as a greeter at Wal-Mart, was pushed by a 37-year-old woman who was "apparently becoming upset that Speelman was trying to verify that the woman had paid for water bottles." Speelman was hit on "her head and was taken by ambulance" to a hospital "where she underwent a CT scan and was released."
Speelman "has been widowed twice and started her job as a greeter when she was 90." Speelman "works five days a week" and "works because she needs the money" (Haggerty, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, 11/29).
