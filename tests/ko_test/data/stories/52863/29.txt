Forget Dr. Octopus or Green Goblin, Spider-Man's newest arch enemy is the theater critic. The new Broadway mega-musical directed by Newton's own Julie Taymor received some rather unkind reviews after Sunday's first preview performance. Writing in the New York Post, Michael Riedel called "Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark" an "epic flop as the $65 million show's high-tech gadgetry went completely awry amid a dull score and baffling script." The show, with a score by Bono and the Edge of U2, ran more than three hours and had to stop five times due to technical glitches. At different times, actress Natalie Mendoza, who plays an evil spider, and Reeve Carney, who is Spider-Man, were stuck suspended over the crowd. Boston nightclub and restaurant owner Ed Kane was in the crowd at the Foxwoods Theater, and pronounced himself impressed with the music, but not so much with the spectacle. "The flying was pretty cool," he said. "But overall, thumbs down." There's still time to fix what ails the show. "Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark" opens Jan. 11.
Brady in cross-hairs
The weird fascination with Tom Brady's hair continues. The rumor mongers at the National Enquirer report that the Pats QB was seen slipping in and out of Leonard Hair Transplant Associates a few weeks ago. The hair clinic endorsed by WEEI jock Mike Adams is based in Rhode Island but has offices on Newbury Street and Newton. According to the Enquirer, Brady paid a visit to Dr. Robert Leonard's Cranston office a couple of days after the Pats' loss to the Browns. While much has been made of Brady's long hair of late, this isn't the first time our football hero has been mentioned in connection with a hair-replacement doc. In 2008, the New York Post reported that the signal caller visited a hair-restoration specialist in Manhattan. A rep for Dr. Leonard sent us this statement yesterday: "At Leonard Hair Transplant Associates, we don't comment on, confirm or deny the identity of any of our patients."
Burnham stays busy
We're told Hamilton homey Bo Burnham headed to LA yesterday to tape an appearance on Conan O'Brien's show. (Bo will be on TBS tonight at 11.) Burnham, whose humorous homemade music videos made him a YouTube sensation, is a busy dude these days. Aside from a pilot for MTV and his work on an anti-"High School Musical" film, Burnham's embarked on a stand-up tour dubbed the "Bo Burnham and (No) Friends" tour. He'll be at the Wilbur for two shows Feb. 5.
It's a boy for Gretta
In case you missed it, Boston spa magnate Gretta Monahan had her baby boy and named him Kai. There are images of Monahan's trek to the hospital on the website for Rachael Ray's show (Gretta is a "Rachael Ray" correspondent). Kai's dad is soap actor Ricky Paull Goldin (he's Jake on "All My Children").
