The new Broadway musical "Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark" sold more than $1 million in tickets within 24 hours after the show's first preview on Sunday night, the lead producer, Michael Cohl, said on Tuesday. The show's maiden performances have drawn comment since the creators are still working on technical sequences; at the first preview the show had to stop five times to deal with glitches. That shaky performance came as some theater producers said that Foxwoods Theater, the landlord for "Spider-Man," had inquired whether they had shows in the works that might be fits for the theater. Late on Monday the theater's general manager, Erich Jungwirth, said in a statement that he had indeed talked to producers "to see if there are any shows coming up that may be able to play in our venue." Such conversations are customary, Mr. Jungwirth said. The producers found the outreach unusual because it came when "Spider-Man" was already delaying its first preview by two weeks and involved a theater with a $65 million show that needs a multiyear run to turn a profit. A spokesman for the production, Rick Miramontez, also said late on Monday, "We are looking forward to 'Spider-Man' being at the Foxwoods Theater for years to come."
