Arts & Entertainment: Comfort, Concern After 'Spider-Man' Preview

The first, shaky preview performance of "Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark" on Sunday is fast becoming theater lore, with tales of dangling performers suspended on wires for several awkward minutes as stagehands addressed technical glitches. On Monday, as those involved in the show expressed confidence in the musical as a future hit, others sounded a wary note.
Ken Abdo, a lawyer for Reeve Carney, who plays Peter Parker/Spider-Man, said that in light of a stage-flying injury last month that left stunt performer Kevin Aubin with two broken wrists, he has some concerns about Mr. Carney's safety. "Our antenna is up," Mr. Abdo said. "We don't want to see him in harm's way."
Mr. Abdo flew from Minneapolis to New York on Monday to see the second preview, slated for Wednesday, in what he called a long-planned gesture of support for Mr. Carney. He said he was confident in the musical's overall safety, but added that Mr. Carney is an actor and rock singer -- not a stunt man -- and he wanted to take a look at the conditions under which his client is working.
"There's some uncharted territory in this," he said. "We just hope that everyone works together and figures it out and makes it amazing and safe."
Much of the musical's flying scenes are performed by multiple Spider-Man stunt doubles. The production said the Spider-Man who was suspended for several minutes over the audience during a technical problem at the end of Act I on Sunday was one of the aerialists, not Mr. Carney. Audience members at the musical described the stranded performer see-sawing back and forth to work up enough momentum so a stagehand could grab his ankle and retrieve him.
Two safety inspectors from the New York State Department of Labor attended the first preview and were satisfied that the show was safe, said department spokesman Leo Rosales. Such preview visits are not standard practice, but made sense given the volume of aerial stunts in this production, Mr. Rosales said, adding that inspectors approved 35 stunts before the first preview.
"We're comfortable with what we've seen, so at this point we don't have plans to return back to view any more maneuvers," Mr. Rosales said.
Asked about a moment in the show when some audience members said a rope accidentally fell onto theatergoers, Mr. Rosales said investigators did not consider the incident a danger to the audience or performers since the rope was lightweight and was not vital to the actors' safety equipment.
Sunday marked the first time the entire show, which is the most expensive in Broadway history and has encountered several delays and a near-cancelation, was performed from start to finish. Rick Miramontez, a spokesman for the show, said producers and the creative team went into the first preview expecting there might be some technical issues and, once the curtain fell, considered the performance a success.
"It may fly in the face of what others are saying, [but] everybody at the show -- the cast, the crew, the creators -- they're feeling fantastic today," he said. "The cast were thrilled to perform the show in front of an audience for the first time."
The show's lead producer, Michael Cohl, could not be reached for comment.
At a party at the Midtown restaurant Tony's Di Napoli following Sunday's preview, cast members and the creative team -- led by Julie Taymor ("The Lion King"), who sat in the orchestra scribbling notes throughout the performance -- appeared in a celebratory mood, according to people at the gathering. Richard Weinberg, one of the musical's investors, said Mr. Carney even joked about his intense physical conditioning for the role and invited Mr. Weinberg and his friends to take a swing at him.
Another investor, Norton Herrick, said he had no regrets after sinking several million dollars into the show. On Monday, the investor from Boca Raton, Fla., said he was certain there was enough time to work out the kinks -- such as sound-system difficulties and a hastily assembled ending -- before opening night, which is set for Jan. 11.
Mr. Herrick attended the first preview with his grandchildren, whom he said were enthralled: "We had three of them there and I think it's the first time they didn't say a word or they didn't do a text during the whole evening."
