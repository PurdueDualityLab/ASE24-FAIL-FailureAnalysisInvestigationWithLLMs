Dec. 03--As a theater fan, I love drama. Planned drama, yes, but surprise drama, too.
Which is why I so appreciate the soap opera that is "Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark."
At $65 million, it's the most expensive musical to hit Broadway. It's also the most technically elaborate show on the Great White Way, which is where the entertainment really comes in ... even (or maybe especially) when the effects don't work.
When "Spider-Man" held its first preview earlier this week at the Foxwoods Theater (more on the Foxwoods Theater later), there were a few, shall we say, glitches in segments where actors are supposed to fly up to 40 miles an hour over the crowd.
The New York Times reported that the performance was halted five times. In one case, Spider-Man was left dangling on a wire mid-auditorium, above theatergoers.
The image of Spider-Man stuck hovering over the audience while stagehands try to drag him by his feet back to solid ground? It's like "Waiting for Guffman," if "Waiting for Guffman" had been about a big-budget Broadway behemoth.
I can't imagine that this was what the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe had in mind when it signed a three-year deal to have the former Hilton Theatre rechristened the Foxwoods Theater. The venue, which is where "Spider-Man" is performed, is operated by Live Nation.
But there is truth in that old saying that all publicity is good publicity. I can't recall the last time I saw so much of the mainstream press reporting on a Broadway musical. "60 Minutes" did a piece on "Spider-Man," interviewing U2's Bono and The Edge, who composed the music, and director Julie Taymor, who was also the creative mind behind Broadway's "Lion King." The "Today" show devoted a segment to "Spider-Man," with a reporter standing outside the Foxwoods Theater. If the idea was to get the Foxwoods name out there more, well, it's working.
I have to admit: I love it when the unexpected happens in showbiz -- in concerts and at the theater. I'm not talking disasters, mind you, just the unexpected. When I heard about that first "Spider-Man" preview, here's what I thought: "Now, I really want to see that show."
Apparently, I'm not the only one. "Spider-Man's" lead producer announced Tuesday that, in the 24 hours after that much-dissected preview, the show sold $1 million in tickets.
Despite the rather rough start, it's not a foregone conclusion that "Spider-Man" will stay rocky. Other musicals -- most recently, "Mary Poppins" -- have run into technical difficulties during previews and worked it all out by opening night.
And let's not forget: This is a show from Taymor, Bono and The Edge. If anyone can pull a success out of a problematic enterprise, they can.
We'll find out when "Spider-Man" officially opens on Jan. 11. Whether it turns out to be an ambitious failure or a pulled-out-of-the-ashes hit, it'll be a headline-making story.
This is the opinion of Kristina Dorsey.
