After weeks of delays while state officials conducted safety checks, Spider-Man on Broadway began previews Sunday. The show was plagued with technical issues, stopping five times and running over three hours long.
It seems the staff at Foxwoods Theater, which hosts the show, don't have high hopes the $65 million production -- the most expensive in Broadway's history -- will improve.
The theater's general manager, Erich Jungwirth, has reached out to several Broadway producers about keeping Foxwoods in mind as they develop and option new productions, according to several sources cited in both the New York Post and New York Times.
The production, which officially opens Jan. 11, had hoped to run for several years to recoup its costs.
Jungwirth said in a statement released by Live Nation, which owns the theater, 'I can confirm that I have met with people in the industry to introduce myself as the new G.M. of the Foxwoods Theater. It is the custom in our industry for a new GM to both introduce themselves in the community and to see if there are any shows coming up that may be able to play in our venue; this is what keeps the lines of communication open and allows both operators and producers to know what inventory and product are available. As for 'Spider-Man: Turn Off The Dark,' we are incredibly positive about the prospects and are optimistic that the show is going to have a fantastic run at the Foxwoods Theater for many years to come.'
A spokesman for Spider-Man said, 'We are looking forward to 'Spider-Man' being at the Foxwoods Theater for years to come.'
Meanwhile, producer Michael Cohl told Entertainment Weekly on Monday that he was 'ecstatic' about the show's first performance, despite the technical glitches that led one audience member to catcall, 'I feel like a guinea pig!'
'We came within just inches of getting through the entire second half without a stop. In your first preview, I think that's quite extraordinary. It is a preview. It is a look inside the process of creating what will be the final live show, and that show will be shown to the world on Jan. 11. Last night was by no means an opening,' Cohl said.
A show spokesman told The Hollywood Reporter Monday, 'There will be no delays in performance schedule. Previews will continue as planned.'
To fix the snafus before officially opening, 'We'll go over an analysis of what happened, why it happened, and how to prevent it from happening next time,' Cohl told EW. 'We'll keep working on it and working on it. It's probably a little more difficult than the average show people do, and in order to make it work, that's why we're here so early and why we're not going to have our official opening until Jan. 11.'
He expects most glitches to be worked out by Dec. 4, the show's fifth performance.
Regardless of issues, 'I thought the audience enjoyed it,' he said of the debut. 'They stood at the end and clapped; they laughed at the jokes; they clapped after every song. I thought it was a 10 out of a 10 in the category of first previews.'
