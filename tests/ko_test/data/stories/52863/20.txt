Spider-Man fails to do what a spider can

How do you convert the whizz-bang acrobatics of Spider-Man into a live Broadway show? With difficulty, judging by Sunday night's preview show.
Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark lived up to its reputation as one of the greatest gambles in musical history when it gave its first public performance to an audience of 1,900 at the Foxwoods theatre in Manhattan. The problem was that its record-breaking budget of more than $65m (42m) was not enough to prevent some pretty glaring glitches.
The show - directed by the creator of The Lion King, Julie Taymor, and with music by Bono and The Edge of U2 - had to be stopped five times to correct faulty technical equipment. The cliff-hanger at the end of the first half, in which Spider-Man saves Mary Jane and then flies across the auditorium ground to a halt when Reeve Carney, playing the superhero, was left swinging helplessly above the audience. It took stage hands almost a minute to drag him down.
The convention of Broadway has traditionally been to maintain a blackout on all previews to give shows time to iron out their wrinkles before press night. But in the age of Twitter and blogging, and with huge interest revolving around the first preview, there was no way that the producers were going to keep chatter at bay until opening night on 11 January.
Several New York papers were in the audience, breaching the agreement over treating previews as non-events. The New York Post's Michael Riedel declared it an epic flop, with dull score, baffling script and 'confusing plot'.
Audience members also gave their instant feedback on Twitter. 'Promising but needs work,' said @joedrape.
