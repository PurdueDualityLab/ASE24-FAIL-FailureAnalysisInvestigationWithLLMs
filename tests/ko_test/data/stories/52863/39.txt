In many reports following the first preview performance of the new Broadway musical Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark on Sunday night, an anonymous audience member was quoted shouting, 'I don't know how everyone else feels, but I feel like a guinea pig today! I feel like it's a dress rehearsal!,' when technical glitches halted the web-slinging production at least five times in mid-air.
Now the New York Post's Michael Riedel -- who could be convincing as Spider-Man's newest super-powered archnemesis, what with all of his gleefully negative coverage of the Broadway blockbuster -- has tracked down and identified the famous heckler: 41-year-old freelance photographer Denise Chastain.
She told Riedel:
'I was like the frog in the boiling water... The slow simmer just got to me, and, by the second act, I just lost it.
'The show wasn't ready. It was like the BP oil rig. All the money people were pushing to drill the well, and what happened? The money people were pushing to get the show open, but the artists weren't ready. I was heckling for justice.'
'Heckling for justice' at a Broadway show's first preview performance? We understand that fans who paid full price for Broadway tickets might be frustrated that they did not see a polished and complete Spider-Man musical. But isn't that the point of previews? If glitches and pauses continue to plague the production through its opening in January, then audiences will have something to worry about. Until then, let's all calm down.
Riedel characterizes Chastain as Spider-Man's 'brand-new baddie' who he christens 'The Heckler,' but the Post columnist clearly considers her a hero and only provides a soapbox for her continued ranting. So Chastain wasn't impressed with the show's first preview -- does that mean we should care about her analysis of director Julie Taymor's artistry or her criticisms of Reeve Carney, who stars as Spidey?
On Monday, producer Michael Cohl promised that the show would be fully functioning in time for its fifth preview, which is schedule for Sat., Dec. 4. 'Well go over an analysis of what happened, why it happened, and how to prevent it from happening next time,' he told EW after Sunday night's performance. 'Well keep working on it and working on it. Its probably a little more difficult than the average show people do, and in order to make it work, thats why were here so early and why were not going to have our official opening until Jan. 11.'
'I thought the audience enjoyed it,' Cohl added. 'They stood at the end and clapped; they laughed at the jokes; they clapped after every song. I thought it was a 10 out of a 10 in the category of first previews.'
Roger Friedman wrote yesterday in 'Spider Man on Broadway: Separating Fact from Fiction,' a colum for the Huffington Post:
Before the performance began, producer Michael Cohl warned the audience there would be 'stops.' This is common in previews, and certainly for the first few. Producer Judy Gordon brought Barnum to Broadway in the 1980s. She told me today that the first previews were a mess, that audience members kept walking out, and that Barnum's tightrope was a constant problem. Barnum went on to be a smash hit...
Oh, and the crazy woman who yelled out the 'guinea pig' line. You'd have to be a real rube, just off the bus from Sheboygan, to think that wasn't a set up. In 40 years of attending Broadway shows, previews, hits, flops, whatever, I've never heard anyone do anything like that. Either the woman was off her meds, or someone was paying her.
