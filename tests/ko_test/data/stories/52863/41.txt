Look out! for shaky Broadway version of Spider-Man; Here comes a shaky Broadway version of Spider-Man
Near the end of the marathon theatrical performance that was the world premiere of Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark -- a show that ran almost three and a half hours, including five stoppages for technical glitches and a 40-minute intermission -- a woman yelled from the audience, 'I don't know about the rest of you, but I feel like a guinea pig tonight. This was a dress rehearsal, not a preview.'
And the rest of the audience booed her.
It was mostly a patient, indulgent and Spidey-friendly crowd Sunday night at the 1,900-seat Foxwoods Theatre on New York City's 42nd Street, there to cheer on a troubled production that is, at $65 million, the most expensive show in the history of Broadway. (The money-losing Shrek: The Musical, which cost $25 million, is second.) It's still a show very much in development, and there were a few walkouts during the delays. 'An epic flop,' wrote Michael Riedel of the New York Post, but some theatre-goers said they were excited by the effects. 'It's the best thing I've ever seen on Broadway,' one man said after the show.
Spider-Man features a score by Bono and The Edge of U2 -- who signed on to write the show nine years ago -- and direction by Julie Taymor, the theatrical visionary who created The Lion King, among other stage shows, and whose feature films include the upcoming The Tempest. Reeve Carney, front-man of the rock band Carney, plays Spider-Man and is also young prince Ferdinand in The Tempest.
Carney co-stars with Jennifer Damiano, who plays his love interest, Mary Jane Watson. The original Mary Jane, Evan Rachel Wood, along with Alan Cumming, who was to play Green Goblin, dropped out because of production delays. The show was supposed to start in March, but that was pushed back because of financial difficulties. It was then to go into previews Nov. 14, but that was delayed by technical complications and injuries: Two actors were hurt (one broke both wrists) in rehearsals doing some of the show's daring aerial stunts.
The aerial work is a big part of the spectacle, seemingly designed to jolt audiences who have become blase about falling chandeliers (in Phantom of the Opera) or helicopters (in Miss Saigon). Performers fly over the audience wearing clearly visible safety harnesses, but with no nets. The show-stopping scenes include a mid-air fight between Spider-Man and his nemesis, Green Goblin. On Sunday, one character -- Arachne, a giant spider from Greek mythology who was added to the Spider-Man legend as an extra villain -- was escorted down the second-balcony aisle by several aides (two of them to hold her extra legs) and she stood on a wooden platform at the edge of the balcony, awaiting her cue to fly down to the stage on wires.
After she got there, stagehands removed the platform and replaced a movable railing, all in view of spectators in the cheap seats (well, $82 each) who got the thrill of a backstage look at a big show.
Spider-Man is still a work in progress: It officially opens Jan. 11, and much could change by then. On Sunday, producer Michael Cohl, spoke to the audience before the show and said we were seeing a preview of the show 'as we develop it.'
The show tells the story of Spider-Man's origins, how mild-mannered Peter Parker is bitten by a spider and turns into a superhero. Taymor dresses it up with inventive spectacle, much of it involving spiderweb designs -- sometimes lit with lasers -- and a visual esthetic that is a fusion of art deco, cubism, and German expressionism. When a tall building is needed, Taymor uses the Chrysler Building for its deco design, and then tips the set into a forced perspective so we get the impression that Spider-Man is crawling up the side. Tall screens turn New York into a stylized cubist landscape.
There are spectacular costumes for other characters: a female villain dressed in silver with a spinning wheel in one hand; a shiny bad guy who shoots sparks, and so on -- and memorable images. Arachne is introduced hanging from two silk curtains that become part of a woven loom; Goblin appears on video screens that meld and merge into a giant face (Bono suggested the character be based on Ted Turner); Peter and Mary Jane walk to their suburban homes on a treadmill embedded into the stage, as flats change perspective behind them, then open into two stylized households.
The spectacle is clearly in place. Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark now has six weeks to fly without stopping.
