Spider-Man musical's web of woe

LIKE a superhero after a lost battle, the Broadway musical starring Spider-Man is fighting back against its greatest nemesis - a series of embarrassing technical glitches.
After the first preview performance last week, Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark had to be halted five times because of technical problems, while two subsequent shows have also had to be stopped.
The show is the brainchild of Tony Award-winning director Julie Taymor and U2's Bono and The Edge, who wrote the music. More than eight years in the making, delays and money woes have plagued the show's debut, leading to scathing comments from Broadway's notorious critics.
The show is also going on without leading lady Natalie Mendoza, who has been sidelined after being hit in the head by a rope during the first preview. Mendoza, who plays Spider-Man's evil love interest Arachne will be out 'for a brief period' but remains with the production.
Lead producer Michael Cohl insisted the multi-million-dollar show is overcoming its gremlins. He said: 'We've worked out 80 per cent of our bugs. We're way ahead of the game.'
Cohl said the reported $65 million megashow will open as planned on 11 January at New York's Foxwoods Theatre following an unusually lengthy six weeks of previews.
But he warned preview audiences may have to endure at least a few bumps along the way, such as when two actors were stuck suspended over the crowd during a preview, or, as in Thursday's performance, Spider-Man got trapped on the balcony.
