IN 'Spider-Man, Turn Off the Dark,' our dangling hero vanquishes a parade of villains - the Green Goblin, Swarm, Electro, Carnage, Swiss Miss and Kraven the Hunter.
But Spidey may have met his match in a brand-new baddie who made an unexpected appearance Sunday night during the show's bungled first preview.
Her name is The Heckler, and she can rattle a show with a catcall.
'I don't know about the rest of you, but I feel like a guinea pig tonight!' she yelled when technical glitches brought the production to a halt for the fifth time.
'I feel this is a dress rehearsal!'
There was silence in the theater until Spider-Man understudy Matthew James Thomas and some friends drowned her out in a chorus of boos.
But the damage was done: Her 'guinea pig' salvo made the papers the next day, drawing even more blood from an already weakened production.
So who is The Heckler?
Through my vast network of super-villain sources, I managed to track her down to her lair - the Philips Plaza Starbucks across the street from the train station in Lynbrook, LI.
'I was like the frog in the boiling water,' The Heckler told me. 'The slow simmer just got to me, and, by the second act, I just lost it.
'The show wasn't ready. It was like the BP oil rig. All the money people were pushing to drill the well, and what happened? The money people were pushing to get the show open, but the artists weren't ready. I was heckling for justice.'
I can reveal that The Heckler's true identity is Denise Chastain.
When she's not catcalling Broadway shows, the 41-year-old works as a freelance photographer, specializing in weddings. To prove that she was at the musical Sunday night, she showed me her ticket stubs - row O, just a few seats away from director Julie Taymor - as well as her Playbill and a photo she took of herself in the theater.
But once I heard her voice, I knew I'd found my Heckler.
'I know, I'm loud!' she yelled at me as we drove to her house. 'I've always been loud!'
Chastain was at the first preview because 'I love Broadway, I love U2, I love Cirque du Soleil and I love Spider-Man,' she said. 'The show sounded really interesting, even though I heard somewhere that it was losing all its money.'
She's seen a lot of shows in previews, including 'Gypsy' with Patti LuPone: 'Oh, my God, she was amazing. She sucked me in!'
But 'Spider-Man' did not.
'The opening was cool, but then these four nerdy kids came on, and I thought, what's the deal? They're overacting, and they're annoying.'
Chastain's referring to a Greek chorus of comic-book nerds who comment on the action. She's not alone in thinking they're 'annoying.' Broadway insiders who saw the show think the nerd chorus should be cut.
She also didn't like Arachne, the female spider who bites Peter Parker and then seduces him. Taymor invented the character, which bears more than a passing resemblance to its creator. At one point, Arachne soars to the top of the theater and declares: 'I am the only real artist working today!'
'Oh, my God - that's so self-absorbed,' Chastain says. 'Julie's looking inward. You have to look outward. Looking inward is the death of an artist. And you can quote me on that!
'I know she loves her spider-woman, but it just has to go,' she adds.
She couldn't follow the plot - 'I zoned out a lot' - and she complained that Reeve Carney, who plays Spider-Man, doesn't have a powerful voice.
'I kept hearing Bono in my head,' she says. 'Reeve is cute, but you gotta have a big voice. And what's with the band? There are two guys onstage who look like '80s rock 'n' roll rejects. They're playing a couple of cheap guitars I could buy at Sam Ash. They should dress them up as villains and give them cool guitars.'
(For the record, the rest of the band is in a room in another part of the theater.)
She did like The Green Goblin, however: 'He's like Bono as Mephistopheles in the Zooropa tour. They should cut out the other villains and just concentrate on The Green Goblin.'
Despite her criticisms, Chastain hopes 'Spider-Man' straightens up and flies right. If it does, she may even take her godson Max to see it.
But be wary, Spider-Man.
If you're still dangling when you should be soaring, The Heckler won't hold back.
And we know that she can be heard all over town.
