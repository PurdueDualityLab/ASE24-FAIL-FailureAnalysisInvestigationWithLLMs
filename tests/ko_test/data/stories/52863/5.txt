NEW YORK - A preview of the US$60 million production of Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark - the most expensive musical ever attempted on Broadway - has brought tales of actors dangling above and audience twiddling thumbs below.
'Not even Spider-Man could avert this disaster. [It] was an epic flop,' said the New York Post. 'High-tech gadgetry went completely awry amid a dull score and baffling script.'

brought the show to a standstill five times, once for six minutes when stage managers struggled to grab the foot of Spider-Man who got stuck.
