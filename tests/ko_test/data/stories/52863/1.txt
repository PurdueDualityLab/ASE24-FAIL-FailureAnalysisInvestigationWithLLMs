Failure to launch ; Spider-Man musical’s inaugural flight is more than a little rocky

ALL US$65 million ($85.5 million) of the new Broadway musical Spider-Man: Turn Off The Dark took flight Sunday night at its first preview performance, but not without bumps. The show stopped five times, mostly to fix technical problems, and Act 1 ended prematurely, with Spider-Man stuck dangling 10 feet above audience members, while Act 2 was marred by a nasty catcall during one of the mid-performance pauses.
Rarely is the very first public run-through of a new musical perfect, and indeed, the creators of this Spider-Man — the most expensive and technically ambitious production ever on Broadway — used news media interviews recently to lower expectations that work on the musical was anywhere near done. But after a two-week delay in performances already this month, which sucked up about US$4 million, the producers decided that on Sunday night the show would go on.
After beginning at 6.54pm — 24 minutes late, mostly because of 1,900 people taking their seats — the show unfolded for 30 minutes with few of the special effects that have been the talk of Broadway this fall. An aerial scene began in Peter Parker’s bedroom to the delight of some audience members — and was promptly halted apparently to free the lead actor, Reeve Carney (who plays Peter Parker and is one of those playing Spider-Man), from an aerial harness.
Most of the night’s major flying sequences — which make up a relative fraction of the show — went off without a hitch, with children and some adults squealing in delight. Until the fourth and final pause at the end of Act 1, which was the worst glitch of the night by far.
Spider-Man had just flown and landed onstage with the musical’s heroine, Mary Jane Watson (played by Jennifer Damiano), in his arms. He was then supposed to zoom off toward the balcony seating area, a few hundred feet away. Instead, a harness and cables lifted Spider-Man several yards up and over the audience, then stopped.
Crew members, standing on the stage, spent 45 seconds trying to grab Spider-Man by the foot, as the audience laughed and oohed. When they finally caught him, a production stage manager, C Randall White, announced the intermission, and the house lights came on.
Act 2 began shortly after 9pm and unfolded fairly smoothly until about 50 minutes later, when White called for a pause. After a few minutes, as some audience members were stretching, a woman in the audience suddenly shouted, “I don’t know how everyone else feels, but I feel like a guinea pig today — I feel like it’s a dress rehearsal.” She was met with a chorus of boos. The performance resumed a moment later; the show ended at 10.09pm.
The musical has attracted outsized public and media attention by Broadway standards, in large part because of the money and talent involved: U2’s Bono and The Edge signed on to create the show nine years ago, and have written a full-length score, their first for Broadway, and helped recruit as the director Julie Taymor, a Tony Award winner for one of the last musical spectaculars to open on Broadway, The Lion King.
At least one young audience member liked the preview. “Parts of it were really exciting,” said six-year-old Jack Soldano, whose parents brought him. “I’ve never seen people flying before.”
