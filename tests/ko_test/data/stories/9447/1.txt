OKLAHOMA CITY -- The state Department of Transportation has cleared its first Y2K computer glitch hurdle, the Oklahoma Transportation Commission was told Tuesday.
ODOT Assistant DirectorMike Mayberry said the department had passed its first Y2K-related test last week. The Y2K problem may cause some computers to malfunction on Jan. 1. Some computer software was written only to recognize years up to 1999. Some computers could mistake the "00" in the year 2000 for the year 1900.
Mayberry noted that July 1marked the beginning of fiscal year 2000 for the state but no problems occurred. He said ODOT computer experts have spent thousands of hours checking computer programs for potential glitches.
The next big test willcome on Sept. 9, Mayberry said. He said some computer codes were written to end on date 9-9-99, which could shut down some computers.
"We've been looking through our codes to find that kind of problem and hopefully we have found them all," Mayberry said.
In other business, thecommission approved the repainting of 69 interstate highway bridges and 36 national highway system bridges at a cost of $8 million in federal and state funding over the next four years.
Also approved was a newindustrial access road for the Griffin Wheel Co., which is investing $150 million in a new facility in Rogers County, creating an estimated 250 jobs.
The board also gave the go-ahead for $3 million in emergency federal funding for roads damaged by tornadoes and storms in May.
