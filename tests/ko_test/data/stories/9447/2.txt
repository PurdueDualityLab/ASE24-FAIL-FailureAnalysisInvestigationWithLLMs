The Oklahoma Transportation Commission took action Tuesday on major projects in Cleveland and LeFlore counties and got good news on their Year 2000 computer preparedness.
The commission approved low bids for the $ 17.5 million U.S. 59 Poteau Bypass in LeFlore County and for $ 5.6 million in work on bridges and approaches at the interchange of Interstate 35 and South 19th Street in Moore in Cleveland County.
Bids also were approved for a $ 4.4 million bridge and resurfacing project on U.S. 183 in Washita County near its intersection with U.S. 183A, for a $ 4.1 million improvement of U.S. 62 in McClain County near the intersection of Oklahoma 9W and for a $ 2.3 million bridge and surfacing project on Oklahoma 1 northeast of Roff in Pontotoc County.
Neal McCaleb, state transportation director and secretary, told commissioners the Oklahoma Department of Transportation had passed its first test on Y2K without a hitch.
The Y2K problem is a glitch that may cause computers to malfunction on Jan. 1. Some computer software was written to recognize years in a two-digit format, such as '99' for 1999. There is uncertainty about what will happen when the year changes to 2000, since some computers may misconstrue the '00' for 1900 instead of 2000.
No problems were reported with the department's computers when July 1 rolled around, marking the first day of Fiscal Year 2000 in Oklahoma.
Mike Mayberry, assistant director of administration, told the commission no accounting problems have thus far been created by agency computers reading the year 2000 designation.
'So far, so good,' Mayberry said of the agency's reprogramming project. The next test will come on Sept. 9, when the date in computers will register as 9-9-99, he said.
Mayberry said agency data had been rechecked after the July 1 date and no changes had been found. He said transportation data, however, 'is not as date sensitive,' as other agencies and institutions.
Before adjourning, the commission voted to provide $ 340,000 in surfacing material for an industrial access road to Griffin Wheel Co. in Rogers County, which is creating 250 new jobs with its new facility.
Access projects also were approved for Lake Etling at Black Mesa State Park in Cimarron County, Lake Texoma in Marshall County and for the Spaniard Creek Recreational Area of the McClellan Kerr Navigational Channel in Muskogee County.
The commission voted to name a bridge over Interstate 35 in northeast Oklahoma City for Dr. A.L. Dowell, a civil rights leader who initiated efforts that led to full integration of Oklahoma City schools.
The panel also designated Oklahoma 51 from the intersection of Oklahoma 75 in Tulsa County extending to the Coweta city limits in Wagoner County as the Broken Arrow Expressway.
