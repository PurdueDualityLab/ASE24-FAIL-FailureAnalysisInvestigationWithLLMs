The looming execution of Norman Lee Newsted would be the 100th occasion on which the state of Oklahoma has put an inmate to death.
Newsted, 45, is scheduled to die by injection shortly after midnight tonight. He was condemned for shooting Tulsa cab driver Larry Donnell Buckley to death 15 years ago.
Gerald Adams, spokesman for Attorney General Drew Edmondson, said Newsted has a last-minute appeal pending before the U.S. Supreme Court. He said he expects the court to reject the filing.
'The appeal is largely based on issues already dealt with,' Adams said.
Prison spokeswoman Lee Mann said Newsted was scheduled to be moved to a holding cell adjacent to the death chamber early today. He will have access to a telephone, a television and a radio, and planned to visit with family members in his last hours.
'The day goes pretty much as he chooses,' Ms. Mann said.
Newsted has ordered a last meal of five glazed doughnuts, five tacos and a vanilla milkshake.
His execution would be the 17th carried out in Oklahoma since the death penalty was reinstated in 1977 and the 100th since statehood.

Projects approved, Y2-K report received
OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - The Oklahoma Transportation Commission has received some good news on the state Transportation Department's Y-2K problem.
Neal McCaleb, state transportation director and secretary, told commissioners the Department of Transportation had passed its first test on Y2K without a hitch.
The Y2K problem is a glitch that may cause computers to malfunction on Jan. 1. Some computer software was written to recognize years in a two-digit format, such as '99' for 1999. There is uncertainty about what will happen when the year changes to 2000, since some computers may misconstrue the '00' for 1900 instead of 2000.
No problems were reported with the department's computers when July 1 rolled around, marking the first day of Fiscal Year 2000 in Oklahoma.
Mike Mayberry, assistant director of administration, told the commission no accounting problems have thus far been created by agency computers reading the year 2000 designation.
'So far, so good,' Mayberry said of the agency's reprogramming project. The next test will come on Sept. 9, when the date in computers will register as 9-9-99, he said.

Couple's estate gives $ 3 million to OSU
STILLWATER, Okla. (AP) - Oklahoma State University is $ 3 million richer, the result of a gift from the estate of an Elk City couple who fell in love while attending the school more than 60 years ago.
Tom and Pauline 'Polly' Miller married in 1937, two years after they graduated from what was then called Oklahoma A&M. Tom left with a degree in agronomy; her degree was in home economics.
After Miller served in World War II, the couple and their baby daughter returned to Miller's family farm in Elk City. He farmed; she taught home economics at the high school.
The Millers accumulated their wealth slowly and simply. On four farms covering 800 acres, Tom Miller raised broomcorn, once a staple of Oklahoma's economy, and cotton - and became Miller Feed Farms. Polly Miller taught home economics for 30 years.
Much of the Millers' endowment will fund scholarships in perpetuity worth $ 5,000 a year to eight graduates of Elk City High School.
