Paul Martin has chance to shake Mr. Dithers label: analysts

BRUSSELS -- If Paul Martin ever needed to make a good impression on the world stage, the time would be now, say political and military observers.
With his Liberal minority government about to deliver what could be a do-or-die budget and fresh from a scathing article in The Economist, which christened him 'Mr. Dithers,' the prime minister arrived Sunday in Brussels to attend a gathering of NATO leaders.
One of the significant challenges facing Martin will be to convince alliance members, especially the United States, that a decade-long funding drought for the Canadian Forces is finally at an end, said a military analyst.
'We've got to stop giving the impression that Canada will be there and then we show up with whatever we can cobble together,' said Murray Lee, a retired colonel who often spoke about the need to replace the aging fleet of Sea King helicopters.
'Looking at The Economist this week calling him Mr. Dithers, here's the perfect opportunity for him to dispel that aspersion and say, 'We're serious, we're going to have a strong foreign affairs policy, we're going to have a strong defence policy and here's the first steps on how we're going to do that.' '
Martin, who hasn't responded to the Mr. Dithers article, remained cloistered in the front of his Armed Forces aircraft Sunday during the flight to Europe.
He avoided the usual stroll to the back of the plane where reporters are camped.
His staff turned down interview requests and said his only scheduled public remarks will be Tuesday, at the conclusion of the summit.
In a background briefing for reporters on Friday, senior Foreign Affairs officials conceded the credibility issue will be addressed during Tuesday's meeting.
Martin will tell world leaders to watch Wednesday's budget for the Liberal 'government's commitment to rebuild the Canadian Forces,' said one official who asked not to be named.
NATO members have long grumbled that as a percentage of gross domestic product, Canada spends less on defence than almost all of its partners.
Ottawa's opposition to the war in Iraq, while cheered in Europe, has only heightened impatience among the alliance's biggest partners, the United States and Britain, for an overhaul of the Canadian military.
Lee said the transport delays and glitches, which befell the DART team as it responded to the tsunami disaster in South Asia, only serve to underline the concerns of the allies.
