Shedding 'Mr. Dithers': Time to make impression, pundits say. Nato meeting a chance for PM to convince allies Canada is giving military a boost

If Paul Martin ever needed to make a good impression on the world stage, the time would be now, say political and military observers.
With his Liberal minority government about to deliver what could be a do-or-die budget and fresh from a scathing article in the Economist, which christened him 'Mr. Dithers,' the prime minister arrived yesterday in Brussels to attend a gathering of NATO leaders.
One of the significant challenges facing Martin will be to convince alliance members, especially the United States, that a decade-long funding drought for the Canadian Forces is finally at an end, said a military analyst.
'We've got to stop giving the impression that Canada will be there and then we show up with whatever we can cobble together,' said Murray Lee, a retired colonel who has often spoken about the need to replace the aging fleet of Sea King helicopters.
Martin, who hasn't responded to the Mr. Dithers article, remained cloistered in the front of his Forces aircraft yesterday during the flight to Europe.
However, he will tell world leaders tomorrow to watch Wednesday's budget for the Liberal 'government's commitment to rebuild the Canadian Forces,' said a Foreign Affairs official, who asked not to be named.
NATO members have long grumbled that as a percentage of gross domestic product, Canada spends less on defence than almost all of its partners.
Ottawa's opposition to the war in Iraq, while cheered in Europe, has only heightened impatience among the alliance's biggest partners, the U.S. and Britain, for an overhaul of the Canadian military.
Lee said the transport delays and glitches that befell the DART team as it responded to the tsunami disaster in southeast Asia only serve to underline the concerns of the allies.
Buying or leasing heavy transport aircraft to haul troops and equipment overseas should be the Liberal government's top military spending priority and it should be followed up by the construction of heavy sealift transport ships, Lee said .
'Both of those steps would go a long way to restoring the faith' of other countries, he said.
The prime minister is expected to announce that 30 military instructors will join a NATO-led force in Jordan that will help train the new Iraqi army.
That commitment also comes with a $1 million contribution toward a trust fund that helps pay for lodging and support of the Iraqi trainees.
As well, Canada will highlight the forthcoming summer deployment of a provincial reconstruction team to southern Afghanistan. The 250 member specialized group will be in addition to the 700 combat troops already based in Kabul.
