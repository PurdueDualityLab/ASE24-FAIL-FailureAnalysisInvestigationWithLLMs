An Intel executive said the chip maker has found the glitch that postponed the launch of the next-generation Centrino mobile CPU, code-named Sonoma, to the first quarter of 2005, and confirmed that some units will ship to PC makers in the fourth quarter.
"We wanted to make sure we addressed a quality issue we found in a late stage of validation," said Anand Chandrasekher, vice president in Intel's Mobile Platforms Group.
Intel has been beset by delays in the launch of both its Sonoma processor as well as its 4GHz Pentium 4 processor. The company has said it would review its entire product road map in light of those issues.
