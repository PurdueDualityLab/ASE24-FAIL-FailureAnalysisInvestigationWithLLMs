'We wanted to make sure we addressed a quality issue we found in a late stage of validation,' Anand Chandrasekher, vice president of Intel's Mobile Platforms Group, told financial analysts last week. 'We have since found that issue and fixed it.'
Intel still expects the chip's volume rollout to be in the first quarter, Chandrasekher said.
Intel has been beset recently by a series of execution problems, including the delayed launch of Sonoma, a delay until next year of the forthcoming 4 GHz version of the Pentium 4, and inventory imbalances. Those issues, among others, convinced top brass at Intel to tell customers they would undertake a top-to-bottom review of Intel's entire product road map to ensure there would be no further slips or disappointments.
