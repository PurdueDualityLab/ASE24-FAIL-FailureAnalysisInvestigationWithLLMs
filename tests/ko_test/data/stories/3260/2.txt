Traffic on Metro's Orange and Blue lines was halted for about two hours during last evening's commute after a suspicious package was found in the Farragut West station downtown.
The package, a tattered briefcase with no handle, was discovered by a passenger about 3:50 p.m. in the station at 17th and I streets NW, said Metro spokeswoman Leona Agouridis. The agency closed the station to passengers, then stopped running trains through it about 4:50 p.m.
I Street also was closed, and police evacuated employees from four large office buildings in the area.
The station reopened about 6 p.m. after D.C. police discovered no explosives in the briefcase, Agouridis said. Investigators from the FBI, the D.C. Fire Department and the Secret Service also were called in to investigate.
The bomb scare was the sixth in the Farragut Square area in the last 11 days, and it caused much confusion for commuters yesterday. Metro provided bus service from the Farragut West station to the McPherson Square and Foggy Bottom stations, Agouridis said, but many simply hoofed it. Some tempers flared, but others said they'd rather be safe than sorry.
'I would much rather be annoyed than blown up,' said Cindy Reilly, of Sterling, who was forced to walk three blocks out of her way to McPherson Square to catch a train.
'My husband works for the State Department, and we lived in London from 1988 to 1990,' Reilly said. 'We had bomb threats and bomb scares all the time, so maybe I'm used to it.'
The scare was the second major inconvenience for Metro riders yesterday. Earlier, service was interrupted on the Blue and Yellow lines because of a computer glitch.
