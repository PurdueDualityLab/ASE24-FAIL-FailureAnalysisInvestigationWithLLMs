Man says he paid $500 for huge pennant, which went missing before being affixed to Rogers Place
FULL TEXT
It was cheeky, it was likely quick and it spoke to the rough edges of a city in thrall to a game played by millionaires.
At some point on Tuesday, a banner - made of thick, glossy material and bearing the Canucks' logo and an image of the Stanley Cup - went missing, purloined when a jack used to place it on Vancouver's Rogers Place experienced a glitch that apparently left the rolled-up banner accessible to someone other than the engineering crew.
On Wednesday, Ian Moore, who runs a moving company called the Move Man, said he came into possession of the banner on Tuesday night when he stopped his truck on the way home from work to see why people were milling around in Pigeon Park.
The park, a popular gathering spot in the city's Downtown Eastside, has been spruced up in recent years but is still known as a place where illegal drugs and stolen goods can on occasion be bought and sold.
Mr. Moore said he bought the 50x20-foot banner - without knowing what company or event it might promote - for $500, purchasing it from a man who was carrying it on the back of a mountain bike. He said he realized what he had only after he'd brought it home.
'It was huge,' Mr. Moore said. 'I knew exactly what it was and where it was supposed to be.'
He said he planned to return the banner to the stadium and hoped that the club would reimburse him for the money that he was out of pocket, adding jokingly that 'tickets wouldn't hurt.'
After his account appeared on The Globe and Mail's website, readers heaped scorn on Mr. Moore's story, questioning why anyone would pay $500 for something purchased on the street, and some suggesting that he'd even stolen the banner himself.
Reached later in the day, Mr. Moore insisted that he had paid that sum for the bulky item because he recognized that the material alone, regardless of what was printed on it, was valuable.
When stadium crew members met him to take back the banner, they told him it was worth $10,000, Mr. Moore said, adding that he'd once paid $1,000 to make a 1.5-metre-square sign from similar material.
Not that they were particularly happy to see him; Mr. Moore says he was greeted and questioned by police when he arrived at Rogers Place. Sounding shaken, he said he wanted to forget about the banner and simply watch the game.
Canucks officials were not immediately available to comment.
At Pigeon Park on Wednesday afternoon, people hadn't heard the story of the Canucks banner but seemed unsurprised that such an item could have made its way there. Some wanted to know if there was a reward for its return.
As for making street purchases, Vancouver Police Department spokesman Lindsey Houghton said police encourage consumers to take precautions to ensure their purchases are legitimate.
The VPD, the city and non-profit groups in the Downtown Eastside are working on programs to reduce the flow of suspect goods in the neighbourhood, including a sanctioned Sunday vendors' market in Pigeon Park. That initiative has been so successful in reducing street disorder and other problems that the city is looking for a permanent site for vendors, a city spokeswoman said on Wednesday.
At Pigeon Park, people talking about the Canucks' quest for hockey's Holy Grail were also happy to expound on the more mundane hustle of the street. A man with a shopping cart piled with empties said he'd seen bicycles, knives, televisions and booze change hands on the square. 'You can tell me a bike's worth $750 and that's great,' he said, 'but I can tell you it's going to go up the street and go for $25. That's just the way it is.'
