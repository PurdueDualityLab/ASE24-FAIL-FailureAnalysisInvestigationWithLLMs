Detroit Red Wings' Chelios faces tax man
By Robert Snell
The Detroit News
Detroit Red Wings star Chris Chelios may be a tough defenseman, but he can't beat the tax man. The Oakland County treasurer claims Chelios owes more than $78,000 in delinquent property taxes, interest and fees.
Chelios, who has been paid more than $48 million in salary since 1989, is earning $750,000 this season in a mostly backup role. He returned to Detroit's lineup against the Anaheim Ducks on Friday after Brian Rafalski was injured.
Chelios, 47, also owns the popular Cheli's Chili Bars in Dearborn and near Comerica Park in downtown Detroit.
What's owed
$78,063
Chelios and his wife, Tracee, owe $78,063 in delinquent property taxes on their Bloomfield Hills home, which was assessed at $2.9 million. They have not paid 2007 summer or winter taxes, according to the Oakland County Treasurer's Office. Chelios owes $61,544 in taxes and is being charged $16,519 in interest and fees, and that figure will grow if he doesn't pay this month. The county filed a Certificate of Forfeiture against the couple on April 9, meaning if they don't pay the back taxes by March 30, 2010, the property will be foreclosed, Oakland County Treasurer Patrick Dohany said Wednesday.
Dohany said it is interesting the 2007 taxes haven't been paid yet and Chelios did pay last year's property tax bill.
"Obviously, there's some sort of glitch somewhere," Dohany said.
His side
Chelios was unaware of the delinquent tax bill until being notified by The Detroit News, Detroit Red Wings spokesman John Hahn said.
"These payments are not handled personally, rather through his accounting firm," Hahn wrote in a Wednesday e-mail. "During 2007-08, he changed firms and apparently, the tax bill for his Detroit-area home was not forwarded to the new firm. The bill will be paid in full by the end of the week."
