The U.S. Justice Department and 19 states - including California - are accusing Microsoft of illegally exploiting its operating-system domination to kill competition. The antitrust trial began Oct. 19.
WEDNESDAY'S DEVELOPMENTS
Though Microsoft Corp. never explicitly proposed that International Business Machines Corp. stop installing a competing operating system on its personal computers, a draft contract between the companies would have sent IBM's OS/2 product "to the grave," an IBM manager testified.
Under cross-examination, government witness Garry Norris acknowledged that a proposed Windows 95 marketing agreement did not specifically prohibit IBM from installing its OS/2 operating system. Still, a series of provisions in the market development contract would "have the effect of killing OS/2 in the marketplace," Norris told Microsoft defense lawyer Richard Pepperman.
IBM ended up installing both operating systems on most of its PCs.
OTHER DEVELOPMENTS
In a separate trial in Utah, Caldera Inc. lawyers will argue today that Microsoft created both deliberate glitches and the perception of incompatibilities between Caldera's computer operating system, DR- DOS, and Windows. The small Orem software company has accused the industry giant of violating antitrust laws, arguing Microsoft employed a broad range of illegal tactics to quash competition for its operating system, MS-DOS.
