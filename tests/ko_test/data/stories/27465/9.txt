Lord squelches speculation he could seek leadership of united right

REGINA (AP) - New Brunswick Premier Bernard Lord squelched any suggestion Sunday he could decide to run for the leadership of a united right-wing Conservative party.
The premier had said in the past he was not interested in running for the leadership of the fledgling federal party, but speculation mounted in recent days he could change his mind.
He poured cold water on the idea after a federal-provincial meeting with new Liberal Leader Paul Martin.
'I've been very clear on that,' Lord said before taking in the Grey Cup game with Martin and the other premiers.
'I'm not running and I've been clear on that since day one. Nothing has changed my mind.'

Communication breakdown hampered counter-terror drill: internal memos

OTTAWA (AP) - The biggest counterterrorism exercise since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, was plagued by poor information sharing, the absence of key Canadian departments and bothersome technical glitches, internal government memos reveal.
A major problem exposed by Exercise Topoff 2 was a lack of cross-border communication between some Canadian and U.S. officials due to the recent shift of many American personnel into the new Department of Homeland Security.
The issue of faulty links will 'need to be resolved' as the huge U.S. department 'matures and develops its own working procedures,' says a Canadian report on the five-day exercise last May.
The report was among newly declassified notes on the drill obtained by The Canadian Press under the Access to Information Act.
Topoff 2, the second major Canada-U.S. disaster exercise involving top officials, tested the reaction of thousands of emergency personnel to the simulated outbreak of pneumonic plague in Chicago and explosion of a radioactive 'dirty bomb' in Seattle, not far from the British Columbia border.
