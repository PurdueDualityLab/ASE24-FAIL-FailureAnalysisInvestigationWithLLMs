Biggest counter-terror exercise since 9/11 revealed poor information sharing, absence of key Canadian departments and technical glitches, report says
The biggest counter-terrorism exercise since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, was plagued by poor information sharing, the absence of key Canadian departments and bothersome technical glitches, internal government memos reveal.
A major problem exposed by Exercise Topoff 2 was a lack of cross-border communication between some Canadian and U.S. officials due to the recent shift of many American personnel into the new Department of Homeland Security.
The issue of faulty links will need to be resolved as the huge U.S. department matures and develops its own working procedures, says a Canadian report on the five-day exercise last May.
The report was among newly declassified notes on the drill obtained by The Canadian Press under the Access to Information Act.
Topoff 2, the second major Canada-U.S. disaster exercise involving top officials, tested the reaction of thousands of emergency personnel to the simulated outbreak of pneumonic plague in Chicago and explosion of a radioactive dirty bomb in Seattle, not far from the British Columbia border.
Officials in both Canada and the United States pointed to the large-scale exercise as an important step toward preparing for another terrorist event such as Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
The drill succeeded in highlighting areas in need of improvement, said Blaine Harvey, a spokesman for the Solicitor General's Department, one of the major participants in Topoff 2.
It's a poor exercise that doesn't expose flaws, Mr. Harvey said. This is why we have counter-terrorism exercises.
While there were some achievements, the internal memos catalogue a litany of headaches experienced by Canadian officials in B.C. and Ottawa:
The strategy for keeping the public informed was not handled as well as it could have been.
Failure to scrutinize media bulletins before their release led to a need for damage control on incorrect data.
A key health official was unaware of an information advisory that people should remain indoors to avoid radiation hazards.
Concerns about proper security clearances for personnel and access to sensitive information provided by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.
Lack of a radio communications check well before the exercise to make sure everything worked.
Ontario officials withdrew from the exercise due to the SARS crisis, while agencies such as Treasury Board, the Privy Council Office, the Fisheries Department and Canadian Coast Guard didn't participate in events at a national support centre, an Ottawa-based component of the drill.
Extensive portions of the memos, including RCMP observations and information presented to the federal cabinet, were not released.
A final report on Canada's participation in the exercise is still being compiled, Mr. Harvey said.
The initial impressions appear to echo findings of a U.S. report on Topoff 2, which noted difficulties in sharing information and head-scratching over new government protocols.
The Canadian memos indicate authorities have approached additional federal departments about participating in Exercise Topoff 3, still in the planning stages.
It will be important not to lose the momentum that has come out of this exercise, says one report. The successes and lessons learned will be recorded and processes developed to improve those areas that were determined to be weak.
