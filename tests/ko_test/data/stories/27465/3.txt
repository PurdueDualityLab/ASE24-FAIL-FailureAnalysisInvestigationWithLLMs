Canada-U.S. exercise reveals flaws in terrorism response; Key federal departments did not take part in Chicago, Seattle emergency simulation

The biggest counterterrorism exercise since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, was plagued by poor information sharing, the absence of participation by key Canadian departments and bothersome technical glitches, internal government memos reveal.
A major problem exposed by Exercise Topoff 2 was a lack of cross-border communication among some Canadian and U.S. officials due to the recent transfer of many of the U.S. personnel into the new Department of Homeland Security.
The issue of faulty links will 'need to be resolved' as the huge U.S. department 'matures and develops its own working procedures,' says a Canadian report on the five-day exercise, held last May.
The report was among newly declassified notes on the drill obtained by The Canadian Press under the Access to Information Act.
Topoff 2, the second major Canada-U.S. disaster exercise involving top officials, tested the reaction of thousands of emergency personnel to a simulated outbreak of pneumonic plague in Chicago and the explosion of a radioactive 'dirty bomb' in Seattle, not far from Vancouver and the British Columbia border.
Officials in both Canada and the United States pointed to the large-scale exercise as an important step toward preparing for another terrorist event such as the 9/11 assaults on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
The drill was successful in highlighting areas in need of improvement, said Blaine Harvey, a spokesman for the Solicitor-General's Department, one of the major participants in Topoff 2.
'It's a poor exercise that doesn't expose flaws,' Mr. Harvey said. ''This is why we have counterterrorism exercises.'
While there were some achievements, the internal memos catalogue a litany of headaches experienced by Canadian officials in B.C. and Ottawa:
The strategy for keeping the public informed 'was not handled as well as it could have been.'
Failure to scrutinize media bulletins before their release led to a need for 'damage control on incor-rect data.'
A key health official was unaware of an information advisory warning that people should remain indoors to avoid radiation hazards.
Concern was expressed about proper security clearances for personnel and access to sensitive information provided by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.
There was no radio communications check well before the exercise ''to make sure everything worked.'
Ontario officials withdrew from the exercise due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome crisis, while agencies such as Treasury Board, the Privy Council Office, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard didn't participate in events being held at a national support centre, an Ottawa-based component of the drill.
Extensive portions of the memos, including RCMP observations and information presented to the federal cabinet, were withheld from release.
A final report on Canada's participation in the exercise is still being compiled, Mr. Harvey said.
The initial impressions appear to echo some findings of a U.S. report on Topoff 2, which noted difficulties in sharing information and head-scratching over new government protocols.
The Canadian memos indicate authorities have approached additional federal departments about participating in Exercise Topoff 3, the next drill, which is still in the planning stages.
'It will be important not to lose the momentum that has come out of this exercise,' says one report.
'The successes and lessons learned will be recorded and processes developed to improve those areas that were determined to be weak.'
