Martin holds first meeting with premiers, begins quest for warmer relations
REGINA (AP) - Prime minister-in-waiting Paul Martin says he'll hold annual meetings with the premiers and give them a bigger role in setting the national political agenda - starting early next year with a conference that will focus largely on health care.
'I have always been in favor of regular meetings with the provinces,' Martin said Sunday after a two-hour huddle with provincial and territorial leaders prior to the Grey Cup, the Canadian Football League's championship game.
'If you're going to establish national objectives and national priorities, you've got to establish it jointly. And that's exactly what I am looking forward to.'
Martin said he wants to keep a promise made by outgoing Prime Minister Jean Chretien and Finance Minister John Manley to hand over an additional $2 billion in health funding to the provinces this year.
But like Chretien and Manley, he cautioned that he won't do it at the cost of driving the federal government into deficit. ---
Lord squelches speculation he could seek leadership of united right

REGINA (AP) - New Brunswick Premier Bernard Lord squelched any suggestion Sunday he could decide to run for the leadership of a united right-wing Conservative party.
The premier had said in the past he was not interested in running for the leadership of the fledgling federal party, but speculation mounted in recent days he could change his mind.
He poured cold water on the idea after a federal-provincial meeting with new Liberal Leader Paul Martin.
'I've been very clear on that,' Lord said before taking in the Grey Cup game with Martin and the other premiers.
'I'm not running and I've been clear on that since day one. Nothing has changed my mind.' ---
Communication breakdown hampered counter-terror drill: internal memos

OTTAWA (AP) - The biggest counterterrorism exercise since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, was plagued by poor information sharing, the absence of key Canadian departments and bothersome technical glitches, internal government memos reveal.
A major problem exposed by Exercise Topoff 2 was a lack of cross-border communication between some Canadian and U.S. officials due to the recent shift of many American personnel into the new Department of Homeland Security.
The issue of faulty links will 'need to be resolved' as the huge U.S. department 'matures and develops its own working procedures,' says a Canadian report on the five-day exercise last May.
The report was among newly declassified notes on the drill obtained by The Canadian Press under the Access to Information Act.
Topoff 2, the second major Canada-U.S. disaster exercise involving top officials, tested the reaction of thousands of emergency personnel to the simulated outbreak of pneumonic plague in Chicago and explosion of a radioactive 'dirty bomb' in Seattle, not far from the British Columbia border.
The drill was successful in highlighting areas in need of improvement, said Blaine Harvey, a spokesman for the Solicitor General's Department, one of the major participants in Topoff 2.
'It's a poor exercise that doesn't expose flaws,' said Harvey. 'This is why we have counterterrorism exercises.' ---
Nova Scotians flock to malls as stores open in Sunday shopping experiment

HALIFAX (AP) - Nova Scotians joined the rest of the country Sunday, eagerly embracing their newfound right to spend their day of rest milling around malls and happily emptying their wallets.
Thousands of people hit the stores in an experiment the government has launched to see whether a majority of residents favors the idea of seven-day-a-week shopping.
'I'm all for it and I think we should have had it a long time ago,' Eleanor Munden, weighed down by parcels, said at a Halifax mall as she and a friend searched for house wares. 'Sunday gives you that extra day to get all your shopping done.'
The Tories enacted legislation last month that will allow for a test of Sunday shopping over several weekends leading up to Christmas.
A plebiscite will be held in the new year to determine whether Nova Scotians would like Sunday shopping year-round, only in the weeks before Christmas, or not at all.
