The hacking gang Lapsus$ successfully breached these organizations using the technique of MFA prompt bombing, where they were able to access accounts by bombarding users with multiple MFA requests until they accepted the authentication [125629].

(b) The software failure incident related to MFA prompt bombing has also happened at other organizations beyond Microsoft, Okta, and Nvidia. The article mentions that elite Russian-state threat actors like Cozy Bear, who were behind the SolarWinds hack, have also successfully defeated MFA protection using this technique. Additionally, the article highlights that the technique has been used in real-world attacks even before the emergence of the Lapsus$ hacking gang, indicating that multiple organizations have faced similar incidents [125629].","(a) The software failure incident related to the design phase can be seen in the article. The incident involves a vulnerability in the multifactor authentication (MFA) system, particularly in the weaker forms of MFA such as one-time passwords sent through SMS or generated by mobile apps like Google Authenticator. Hackers like the Lapsus$ data extortion gang and elite Russian-state threat actors have successfully defeated this protection by exploiting loopholes in the design of the MFA system [125629].

(b) The software failure incident related to the operation phase is evident in the exploitation of the MFA prompt-bombing technique by hackers. This technique involves tricking users into accepting multiple MFA requests until the hacker gains access to the account. The operation of the MFA system, including the acceptance of phone app push notifications or phone calls as a second factor, was manipulated by threat actors to bypass the security measures, highlighting a failure in the operational aspect of the system [125629].","The software failure incident discussed in the articles is related to the boundary of the system. The failure was due to contributing factors that originated from both within and outside the system.

1. Within_system: The failure within the system was related to the vulnerabilities in the Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) mechanisms used by various organizations. Weaker forms of MFA, such as SMS-delivered one-time passwords or push prompts, were exploited by hackers like Cozy Bear and Lapsus$ to bypass the authentication and gain unauthorized access to accounts [125629].

2. Outside_system: The failure outside the system was attributed to the actions of threat actors like Cozy Bear and Lapsus$, who exploited the weaknesses in the MFA systems implemented by organizations. These threat actors used social engineering tactics, such as bombarding users with multiple MFA requests until they accepted, to trick individuals into granting access [125629].","(a) The software failure incident occurring due to non-human actions:
The software failure incident described in the articles is primarily due to weaknesses in the implementation of multifactor authentication (MFA) systems. Specifically, the incident involves a technique known as MFA prompt bombing, where hackers exploit vulnerabilities in older, weaker forms of MFA, such as SMS-delivered one-time passwords or push prompts, to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to accounts [125629].

(b) The software failure incident occurring due to human actions:
The software failure incident also involves human actions, particularly in terms of the actions taken by hackers to exploit the vulnerabilities in the MFA systems. The hackers, such as the Lapsus$ data extortion gang and elite Russian-state threat actors like Cozy Bear, actively engaged in tactics to trick users into accepting multiple MFA requests or manipulating IT administrators to reset MFA and enroll new devices, thereby compromising the security of the systems [125629].","(a) The software failure incident discussed in the articles does not directly relate to hardware failures. The focus is on the weaknesses in multifactor authentication (MFA) systems and how hackers were able to bypass certain forms of MFA to gain unauthorized access to accounts [125629].

(b) The software failure incident discussed in the articles is related to weaknesses in software, specifically in the implementation of multifactor authentication (MFA) systems. Hackers were able to exploit vulnerabilities in certain forms of MFA, such as SMS-delivered one-time passwords and push prompts, to bypass authentication and gain access to accounts. This highlights the importance of using more secure forms of MFA, such as FIDO2, to prevent such incidents [125629].","(a) The software failure incident discussed in the articles is malicious in nature. The incident involves hackers exploiting weaknesses in older, weaker forms of multifactor authentication (MFA) to bypass security measures and gain unauthorized access to accounts. Elite threat actors like Cozy Bear and hacking groups like Lapsus$ have successfully defeated the protection provided by MFA through techniques like MFA prompt bombing. These attackers took advantage of vulnerabilities in the MFA system to issue multiple MFA requests until the legitimate user accepted the authentication, allowing the threat actors to gain access to the account [125629].

Additionally, the incident involves hackers using social engineering tactics, such as tricking targets into accepting MFA requests by pretending to be part of the company or bombarding them with multiple requests until they comply. The attackers exploited weaknesses in MFA systems, highlighting the importance of using MFA correctly and the need for organizations to continuously improve their security measures to defend against sophisticated threats [125629].","(a) The intent of the software failure incident related to poor decisions can be inferred from the article. The incident involving the software failure was due to poor decisions made in the implementation of multifactor authentication (MFA) systems. Weaker forms of MFA, such as those relying on SMS-delivered one-time passwords or push prompts, were exploited by hackers to bypass security measures. These weaker forms of MFA were not as effective in preventing account takeovers compared to stronger forms like FIDO2. The failure to adopt more secure MFA methods, despite their availability, can be seen as a poor decision that contributed to the software failure incident [125629]. 

(b) The software failure incident can also be attributed to accidental decisions or unintended consequences. For example, the article mentions how some employees may inadvertently accept MFA requests due to tactics like MFA prompt bombing, where multiple requests are sent until the user accepts one. Additionally, the reliance on third parties to manage networks or perform essential functions, who may use weaker forms of MFA, can lead to unintended vulnerabilities. These accidental decisions or oversights in implementing and managing MFA systems can contribute to the software failure incident [125629].","(a) The articles do not provide information about the software failure incident occurring due to development incompetence.

(b) The software failure incident related to MFA prompt bombing can be considered as a failure due to contributing factors introduced accidentally. The incident involved hackers exploiting weaknesses in older, weaker forms of MFA, such as SMS-delivered one-time passwords or push prompts, to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to accounts [125629].","The software failure incident discussed in the articles is more related to temporary failures rather than permanent ones. The incident involves vulnerabilities in the Multifactor Authentication (MFA) system, specifically the technique known as MFA prompt bombing, where hackers exploit weaknesses in certain forms of MFA to gain unauthorized access to accounts [125629]. This type of failure is temporary as it is caused by specific circumstances, such as the exploitation of vulnerabilities in older, weaker forms of MFA like SMS-delivered one-time passwords or push prompts sent to mobile devices, rather than being a permanent failure inherent to the system itself.","(a) crash: The articles do not mention any software failure incident related to a crash where the system loses state and does not perform any of its intended functions.

(c) timing: The software failure incident does not involve the system performing its intended functions correctly but too late or too early.

(d) value: The software failure incident does not involve the system performing its intended functions incorrectly.

(e) byzantine: The software failure incident described in the articles does not involve the system behaving erroneously with inconsistent responses and interactions.

(f) other: The software failure incident described in the articles involves a failure related to the bypassing of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) through a technique known as MFA prompt bombing. This behavior involves exploiting vulnerabilities in the MFA system to trick users into accepting multiple authentication requests, ultimately gaining unauthorized access to accounts [125629].","(a) The failed system in the reported incident is related to the information industry, specifically in the context of cybersecurity and account protection through multifactor authentication (MFA) [125629]. The incident involved hackers successfully bypassing weaker forms of MFA, such as SMS-delivered one-time passwords or push prompts, to gain unauthorized access to accounts. This failure highlights the importance of implementing strong MFA measures to protect sensitive information and prevent account takeovers.","(property) The consequence of the software failure incident discussed in the articles is related to property being impacted. The incident involved hackers successfully bypassing weaker forms of multifactor authentication (MFA) to gain unauthorized access to accounts of individuals and organizations, including companies like Microsoft, Okta, and Nvidia. This unauthorized access allowed the hackers to breach systems and potentially access sensitive data or resources, impacting the security and integrity of the affected entities' data and systems [125629].","The software failure incident described in the articles does not involve a cyber-physical system.

The failure occurred due to the ability of attackers to alter the firmware of cloud servers, specifically in the case of IBM's bare metal cloud computing service. The incident involved researchers demonstrating how they could make changes to the firmware of servers, which persisted even after the servers were released back into the pool of available machines for other customers to rent [81120].","(a) The software failure incident in the articles is related to non-human actions, specifically the ability to alter firmware in cloud servers without human intervention. Researchers at Eclypsium demonstrated how they could rent a server from a cloud computing provider, such as IBM, and alter its firmware, hiding changes to its code that persist even after the server is released and rented by another customer [81120]. This incident highlights a vulnerability in the cloud servers' firmware that can be exploited without direct human involvement, potentially leading to malicious activities like spying, data alteration, or destruction of the server.

(b) The software failure incident is also related to human actions. While the vulnerability itself may have been introduced without direct human participation, the researchers at Eclypsium actively demonstrated the exploit by making benign alterations to the firmware of IBM servers in their testing [81120]. Additionally, IBM responded to the research findings by implementing a fix that involved wiping and reflashing the servers' BMC firmware between different customers' uses, indicating a human-initiated response to address the issue.","(a) The software failure incident related to hardware:
The incident described in the article [81120] involves a software failure incident that is related to hardware. Specifically, the failure is due to vulnerabilities in the firmware of a hardware component called the baseboard management controller (BMC) in Super Micro servers offered by IBM in their bare metal cloud computing service. The compromised firmware in the BMC allows for malicious code to persist even after the server is released back into the pool of available machines for other customers. This hardware-related vulnerability poses a significant risk as it can lead to spying on the server, data alteration, or even destruction of the server by hackers.

(b) The software failure incident related to software:
The software failure incident described in the article [81120] is also related to software. While the root cause of the issue lies in the compromised firmware of the hardware component (BMC), the persistence of malicious code in the firmware highlights a software-related failure. The compromised firmware can be considered as a software failure since it allows for unauthorized access, manipulation of the operating system, and potential ransomware attacks, all of which are software-related consequences of the hardware vulnerability.","(a) The software failure incident described in the articles is malicious in nature. The incident involved researchers demonstrating how they could rent a server from a cloud computing provider, alter its firmware, and hide changes to its code that persist even after they stop renting it. This technique could be used to plant malware in servers' hidden code, allowing hackers to spy on the server, alter its data, or destroy it at will [81120]. The researchers made benign changes to the IBM servers' firmware in their demonstration, but they warned that the same technique could be used for malicious purposes [81120].

(b) The incident is non-malicious in the sense that the researchers initially made harmless alterations to the BMC's firmware of the IBM bare metal cloud servers as part of their experiment [81120]. However, the concern raised was that it would be easy to hide truly malicious firmware using the same method, indicating the potential for non-malicious changes to be escalated to malicious ones [81120].","The software failure incident described in the articles can be categorized under both poor_decisions and accidental_decisions:

(a) poor_decisions: The incident involved a vulnerability where researchers demonstrated the ability to alter firmware in cloud servers, potentially allowing for the planting of malware that persists undetected even after the server is used by another customer [81120].

(b) accidental_decisions: The vulnerability in the firmware of the cloud servers was not intentional but rather a result of the inherent security flaw in the design and management of the servers, which allowed for the persistence of firmware alterations [81120].","(a) The article discusses a software failure incident related to development incompetence. The incident involved a vulnerability in the firmware of IBM's bare metal cloud servers, where researchers at Eclypsium demonstrated how they could alter the firmware of rented servers, allowing for the persistence of hidden malicious code even after the server is released back into the pool of available machines for other customers [81120]. This incident highlights a security flaw that was not addressed initially, showcasing a failure due to contributing factors introduced by a lack of professional competence in ensuring the security and integrity of the cloud servers' firmware.

(b) The software failure incident can also be categorized as accidental. The vulnerability in the firmware of the cloud servers was not intentionally created by the cloud service provider or the customers renting the servers. It was a result of a flaw in the design or implementation of the servers' firmware that allowed for unauthorized alterations to persist even after the servers were released and rented by other customers [81120]. This accidental introduction of a security vulnerability showcases a failure due to contributing factors introduced accidentally, rather than through deliberate actions.","The software failure incident described in the article is more aligned with a temporary failure rather than a permanent one. The incident involved researchers at the security firm Eclypsium demonstrating how they could alter the firmware of cloud computing servers, specifically focusing on IBM servers, in a way that allowed changes to persist even after the server was released and rented by another customer [81120].
