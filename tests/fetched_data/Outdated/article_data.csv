3111,[],2010-09-27 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.wired.com/2010/09/apple-media-obsession/,https://www.wired.com,,"Published on 2010-09-27 07:00:00+00:00.  A study published Monday drew on a host of metrics to conclude something we all already knew: The media covers Apple more than any other company. In the past year, headlines about Apple took up 15.1 percent of tech news coverage, while articles about Google constituted about 11.4 percent, and a meager 3 percent were about software giant Microsoft, according to the  Pew Research Center study . Guilty as charged. Here at Wired.com we confess that we write about Apple more than any other company. Cuff us. But first, hear our reasons why we opt to cover the big A more than its rivals. Apple delivers Talk all the trash you want about the iPhone lacking Flash or the iPad being unable to print (until November). Apple delivers on products and then talks about them -- exactly the reverse of the way most tech companies work. If you put yourself in the shoes of a tech journalist for just a few months, you'll undoubtedly write about company after company who promises some sort of awesome new technology ""coming soon."" You publish, you sit, you wait, and often times that product never comes into existence — or if it does,  it flops miserably . Examples include the  Plastic Logic Que , Microsoft  Courier , and  HP Slate . Apple's culture of secrecy can be frustrating when journalists want answers to questions about public concerns, but holding off on product news until it's ready for prime time works well for Apple. When Steve Jobs finally talks about a new product, it's finished and ready to ship. It's a lot easier (and less meaningless) to write about things that happen — objects that are real that we can hold in our hands — as opposed to imaginary ""products"" that may never appear in stores. Apple creates strong stories When Apple releases a product or announces a piece of news, the company tells a story in a well organized, neatly cohesive way. In his famous keynotes, Jobs introduces products with a slideshow presentation punctuated with colorful adjectives and active verbs, and he sometimes throws in a story to explain the history leading up to the product. Duly, some communications specialists have hailed  Jobs' presentations as the best in the world . Compare this strategy with Google's. After the search giant released a few well-baked products like Google Mail and Google Search, the corporation splintered off into a flurry of departments with ambitious engineers that seem to announce a new project every day, without giving us a clear understanding of why any of this stuff exists. Take  Google Wave , for example: What was that all about? Even after its death, we still don't really know what it was. Or even take a look at Samsung's eyebrow-raising strategy with the Galaxy Tab. First the company announces the  Tab exists , then slowly it rolls out  news about carriers , and eventually we'll hear about pricing. This sporadic storytelling results in a series of small dips in the pool of tech news, which is never quite as powerful as Apple's big splash. Apple takes design seriously Apple's extreme vanity about design sometimes requires customers to pay a premium, but it works well as a marketing tool. Make pretty stuff and journalists can take pretty pictures for their readers. Build a reputation of designing products that work very well, and the media will scrutinize you for every little flaw. Whether it's good or bad press, Apple's design philosophy naturally generates a lot of coverage in the media. Apple has a well-planned ecosystem of products Apple has gradually built an ecosystem of services, software and hardware that all come together in a way that's easy for consumers to understand. iTunes sells music and videos that run on Macs, iPods and iOS devices, along with apps that run on the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. By creating a friction-free, cohesive experience, anyone who's an Apple customer — including journalists who write about Apple — knows what it means to be an Apple customer. As a result, each product or service becomes a sub-brand that's instantly recognizable to anyone who's even touched an Apple product. Again, the end result is that Apple's carefully refined ecosystem is easier to write about for a mainstream audience. Readers demand Apple news Perhaps as a result of all the aforementioned reasons, Wired.com readers want to know about Apple more than any other company. Our most-searched term is usually ""iPhone,"" and Apple stories are often among our best-read tech stories. We don't know for sure, but we're guessing other tech writers and editors see the same thing happening with their Apple stories, too. Bottom line: We write Apple stories because you, our readers, want to read them.

By  Mark Brown , Wired UK Presenting at the 27th  Chaos Communication Conference  in Berlin, members of renowned hacking group fail 0verflow took to the stage to announce that the PlayStation 3's internal security has been completely overthrown. Hackers now have the same tools as console manufacturer Sony to decide what software can be run on the device. The games console, which has so far been largely resilient to hacking attempts, uses a tightly guarded encryption system to make sure only games, downloads and software updates signed by Sony will actually run. Each piece of code is required to present a cipher, created by a mathematical formula, to pass encryption. But now, the team is in possession of those encryption keys. And you are too, thanks to renowned iPhone hacker George Hotz, who  published the codes on his website . This gives any software maker unbridled access to the PlayStation 3's innermost workings, laying the console's architecture bare for coders and hackers to run riot.  Pirated games , unsigned applications and even full, hard-coded custom firmwares can be run on the console, and Sony has no way to fix the glaring exploit -- outside of releasing brand new hardware with a completely new encryption method. It leaves the PlayStation 3, once a resilient and well-fortified gadget, as possibly the most vulnerable home console currently on the market -- even more open to exploitation than the Xbox 360 and Wii, which were opened up to piracy and hacking long before Sony's box. So what took these hackers so long? Members of the  fail 0verflow  team -- a collaboration of hackers and coders best known for cracking the Wii and executing unsigned code on Nintendo's console -- said Sony's removal of Linux on the console was the impetus they needed to get on and hack it. Much to the aggravation and chagrin of amateur developers and hackers, Sony removed support for OtherOS (and the ability to install operating system Linux and therefore unsigned code) in May 2010, and shipped the PS3 Slim in September 2010 with no support for Linux. ""By doing this, Sony pissed off the hackers,"" a team member stated at the Berlin conference. Now, it's up to developers and coders to move on with their own projects, safely in possession of the console's encryption keys. ""We won't be working long-term on [a custom firmware] or similar,"" the team wrote on its official Twitter account. ""We'll release tools and a PoC, someone else can take over. "" The fun part is done ."" This full exploit comes just months after hackers released a  USB device called PSJailbreak Exploit , which let unscrupulous users play hacked or pirated code as long as a special USB dongle was jammed in the console. But it wasn't without its problems: You had to be stuck on an older firmware, meaning some bang-up-to-date games wouldn't work, and Sony could easily fight back with software updates. Those problems should be nonexistent on this new vulnerability exploit.

3710,[25],2011-01-07 08:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/jan/07/playstation-3-hack-ps3,https://www.theguardian.com,,"Published on 2011-01-07 08:00:00+00:00. In December, a group of coders operating under the name Fail0verflow stood up at the Chaos Communications hackers conference in Berlin and proclaimed that the Sony PS3 security system was an epic fail. Through the use of what they termed ""simple algebra"" they had managed to exploit a weakness in the PlayStation 3's encryption system, thereby gaining the public key required to run any software on the machine.

Legitimate games and movies will only play on the console because the discs provide a password or signature to the encryption system, which recognises them as authorised products. But with the key – essentially a long sequence of numbers – Fail0verflow coders would be able to compile their own custom firmware and then build applications that could run on any system. (You can view their presentation here)

Like many members of the hacker community, Fail0verflow is resolutely anti-piracy – its members bypass console security systems merely as an intellectual challenge, or to run their own operating systems and applications. Consequently, the group didn't itself reveal the key. However, days later hacker, George Hotz (also known as Geohot), previously responsible for opening the iPhone system to so-called ""jailbreak"" hacks, did released the required firmware package decrypter on his website. Although the current hack requires users to modify their PS3 to run homebrew apps (or use a PS3 'Jailbreak' dongle, which bypasses the security system on machines with older versions of the firmware), further developments may ensure that anyone with the relevant software tools and technical knowledge could produce applications that will run on any PS3. It would then effectively be an open system. And naturally, the floodgates that have prevented widescale piracy on the console for the last few years could be smashed to pieces.



Console hacking of this sort has been a part of the games industry for over a decade. Sega's Dreamcast console, launched in 1999, was one of the first major targets, favoured by homebrew coders for its powerful hardware, online functionality, and ease of access. The original Xbox also proved to be an easy machine to hack, thanks in part to a leaked SDK, which gave coders low-level access to the hardware.

Both the Nintendo DS and PSP have been comprehensively hacked, too, opening the doors not only to homebrew apps but to rampant piracy. There are products available for Nintendo's handheld that allow gamers to download pirated titles from the web and store dozens on a single cartridge. According to a report published by Japan's Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association last year, piracy on the Nintendo DS and Sony PSP has cost the industry $41bn (£26.5bn) since June 2004. It has also seen dozens of third-party developers and publishers abandoning the platforms. In 2009, Peter Dille of Sony Computer Entertainment Amerrica told Gamasutra, ""We can look at data from BitTorrent sites from the day Resistance: Retribution goes on sale and see how many copies are being downloaded illegally, and it's frankly sickening. We are spending a lot of time talking about how we can deal with that problem.""

Usually, what happens in these situations is an arms race with the hacker community. An exploit will be devised and distributed and the console manufacturer will release a firmware update that plugs the gap. This repeats, and with popular systems like the PSP, the hackers just keep coming back. As Dark Saviour of the UK-based homebrew news site, DC EMU, explains, ""Sony released new firmware to close exploits on the PSP, but you would only need the new firmware for newer games, being on a older firmware did not taint the PSP experience, because it's mosly an offline console. Also with such a great homebrew scene, coders kept finding ways to get round the firmware fixes, and even released firmware downgraders so you could use the new firmware to play the new games and then downgrade your firmware to play your homebrew apps (and unfortunately warez games). It's quite a powerful system, has a huge homebrew library, and getting homebrew running is not that hard. There are many that argue that the PSP would never have sold as well as is has without the great homebrew scene.""

Predictably, the manufacturers don't see it that way. Last year, Microsoft took the extra step of banning gamers from Xbox Live if they were found to be running pirated or back-up copies of games on their systems. That may be a possibility for Sony, but updating the firmware is no longer an option: the PS3 hack affects the core of the whole encryption system; the only way to close the door is to launch new hardware with an entirely fresh security setup.

Was this hack always an inevitability? Perhaps not. Fail0verflow claims it only started to work on the PS3 system when Sony made the decision to disable the machine's Other OS functionality. This feature allowed owners to install their own Linux OS onto the console, giving them the ability to create and run their own applications, and to load apps developed by other users. It was an interesting invitation to the programming community, harking back to the 1997 launch of the Net Yaroze, a special programmable version of the original PlayStation console, which was widely used by home coders and by universities setting up games develoment courses at the time.

However, at the end of 2009, George Hotz announced via his blog that he was attempting to hack the PS3. His way in was through Other OS. The PS3's security ""Hypervisor"" allowed homemade Linux to run, but in a supervised mode with no access to lower level system functionality. Geohot bypassed the hypervisor, and published elements of the exploit online leaving the rest of the work to other hackers.

Sony's response was to issue Firmware update v3.21, which disabled Other OS, removing the Linux fuctionality and closing the system to home coders. The move was a red rag to the homebrew community. ""[PS3] became a valid target,"" pytey, a member of Fail0verflow told BBC News. ""That was the motivation for us to hack it.""

But did Sony really have much of a choice? When Other OS was effectively removed, Patrick Seybold, SCEA's director of communications and social media stated in a blog post that ""disabling the Other OS feature will help ensure that PS3 owners will continue to have access to the broad range of gaming and entertainment content from SCE and its content partners on a more secure system"". And that's the heart of it – the manufacturer's ""entertainment partners"" rely on the company to ensure their products aren't vulnerable to piracy. As Gamesindustry.biz points out in an editorial today:

The hackers who follow in Fail0verflow's footsteps and create custom firmware to run pirated games, emulators and so on will be targeting Sony's hardware, but it's third-party publishers and developers who have the most right to be outraged. The license fee they pay to Sony for every piece of software they sell is, in many respects, a fee for security – the price of selling software on a platform where piracy is difficult or damn-near impossible. Now that has been taken away from them, with the PS3 looking set to become the easiest platform to pirate software for – easier even than the Wii, DS or PSP, all notorious piracy targets but all of which require some degree of technical knowledge to get pirated software working.

In other words, Sony owes it to the games publishers and movie studios who create products for its machine to maintain a safe, secure platform. As soon as Geohot revealed that exploits were possible via OtherOS, the whole concept was compromised. Sony has already seen game publishers evacuating the PSP platform, it may have felt that there was little choice here.

In the future, is there a way that hobbyist coders could be appeased by console manufacturers? Generally, it's the anti-piracy programmers who have the ability to create hacks and exploits of closed systems – the producers of ""jailbreak"" cartridges and pirated warez tend to come along afterwards, taking advantage of coders who maintain, perhaps rather idealistically, that they're just interested in the hardware as a development platform.

With this in mind, Space Rogue of the Hacker News Network reckons it's time for console producers to stop viewing homebrew coders as the enemy. ""Basically manufacturers really need to start taking advantage of the possibility that their hardware will be modified,"" he argues. ""Doing so should be seen as a profit centre and not loss of sales. Take a look at the Linksys WRT series of routers. A large number of those have been sold specifically because people could mod them and run their own software.

""Sony and other companies are still trying lock down the hardware in an effort to protect their content. The solution here is to open up the hardware, welcome tinkerers and create loyalty to your brand. Another example is the Microsoft Kinect: Micosoft originally tried to lock it down but after people opened it up anyway, MS realised they couldn't keep it closed and opened up the platform resulting in more sales. Unfortunately, based on past moves by Sony I doubt they will take the same approach and the cat and mouse game will continue.""

The central problem remains however: once the platform is open to hobbyists, it's open to pirates. Plus, many members of the coding community are unlikely to be appeased by a walled garden approach to hardware access, such as Microsoft's XNA architecture which allow home coders to create Xbox 360 games for distrubution via the Xbox Live Indie Community. As Dark Saviour suggests, ""I think they have some interest, but because they are normally limited in some way, either by licenses or how much of the consoles 'power', they can use, they don't have the same appeal as homebrew. At one stage someone was porting a Mega Drive emu to the Xbox 360 via XNA but they stopped because they released that MS would never let them release it, and XNA will not let you load a DVD – for example, a disc with your Mega Drive roms on it. I would say that Apple has done the best with engaging homebrew coders with the App Store which is far easier to get things released on it – even though Apple still blocks a lot of releases.""

Interestingly though, Apple itself is in a similar situation to Sony. The new Mac App store has been hacked within 24 hours of its launch, allowing pirated software to be placed on the platform. Once again, the method has involved replacing signature files on illegitimate apps so that the security system sees them as official releases.

This is a war of attrition between manufacturers and hackers, but it is one in which the resources are utterly asynchronous. Console companies have the money to fund ever more intricate security systems, but they have to ship hardware at some point, and customers will only put up with so many firmware updates and featureset changes. Home coders, meanwhile, lack financial might, but have the time, perseverance and guile to keep chipping away for years on end. Sony has yet to comment on the PS3 hack, but is surely looking into its legal options, which are likely to be complex and limited. In 2007, the AACS encyprition key protecting the HD DVD format was cracked and distributed online; the Motion Picture Association of America sent out cease and desist letters to websites publishing the numbers, but bloggers responded by replicating the code on hundreds of thousands of sites. No cases were brought to court – indeed the American Bar Association issued a report which questioned the illegality of distributing encyrption keys.

For PS3, the future is uncertain. It's possible that hacks will become available, allowing console owners to download game ROMs onto hard drives, USB sticks or Blu-ray discs – these may run without modifications to the console hardware. It puts Sony Computer Entertainment in the same camp as the music and movie industries. Perhaps all that the company can now do is learn a very expensive lesson about the creation of encryption systems, a lesson that must then apply to the production of either the next iteration of PS3, or to any future consoles. For now, it has an open platform on its hands and, very probably, some extremely pressing questions from game publishers.

UPDATE: Sony has claimed to Edge magazine, that it WILL be able to fix the security breach: ""We are aware of this, and are currently looking into it,"" Sony said in a short statement. ""We will fix the issues through network updates, but because this is a security issue, we are not able to provide you with any more details.""",2023-10-16 21:53:22.444703+00:00,True,True,True,True,0.9579652234650716,PlayStation 3 hack – how it happened and what it means - The Guardian,,"The software failure occurred in December and involved the Sony PS3 security system.

Pie de foto, La consola era considerada una de las más seguras del mercado.

Sony emprendió una acción legal contra los hackers que desmantelaron la seguridad de la consola PlayStation 3 (conocida como PS3) y contra quienes revelaron y publicaron los códigos maestros del aparato.

Estos códigos permiten que cualquier persona pueda potencialmente instalar un programa en la máquina, incluyendo juegos pirata.

Sony argumenta que dichas acciones constituyen violaciones a sus derechos de autor y fraude informático.

Pero George Hotz, uno de los hackers en el centro de la controversia, le dijo a la BBC que creía ""cómodamente"" que la solicitud de la compañía no iba a prosperar.

""Soy un ferviente creyente de los derechos digitales"", afirmó Hotz.

""Esperaría que una empresa que se enorgullece de su propiedad intelectual tuviera un buen conocimiento de la ley, por lo que la acción me decepciona. He hablado con un consejero legal y me siento lo suficientemente cómodo como para creer que la acción de Sony en mi contra no tiene fundamentos"", añadió.

Hotz, de 21 años, fue demandado junto con más de 100 personas asociadas al grupo de hackers conocido como fail0verflow.

En la acción judicial, presentada en un tribunal de California, Sony solicita una orden de restricción que prohíba a Hotz realizar actividades que alteren programas informáticos y prevenga la distribución del software creado a partir de sus logros.

""Trabajando de forma individual pero organizada, los acusados recientemente consiguieron saltarse las efectivas medidas de seguridad empleadas por Sony"", se lee en el documento.

""Usando internet, los acusados están distribuyendo programas, herramientas e instrucciones que brincan las medidas de protección y facilitan el contrabando de videojuegos, En este momento ya se están empacando y distribuyendo juegos pirata para estos dispositivos"".

Códigos secretos

La polémica se centra en una serie de códigos secretos que Sony utiliza para impedir que su sistema sea utilizado con fines no autorizados.

Entre ellos se encuentra un número que se emplea para autorizar los juegos y software de la PS3, con el fin de comprobar que son genuinos.

Sin embargo, si se conoce el código, éste se puede utilizar para autorizar cualquier software, incluyendo programas no autorizados y, potencialmente, juegos pirata.

La protección de la PlayStation se mantuvo impenetrable durante siete años, pero miembros de fail0verflow lograron romper la seguridad en diciembre. Después Hotz, usando un método similar, consiguió el código maestro.

El sitio de web de fail0verflow desapareció de la noche a la mañana y fue reemplazado por un mensaje titulado ""Sony nos demandó"".

La seguridad de la consola de videojuegos PlayStation 3 (o PS3) ha sido desmantelada por hackers lo que potencialmente podría permitir que cualquier persona instalara los programas de su elección -incluyendo videojuegos pirata- en el aparato.

Un grupo de hackers mostró recientemente un método que obliga al sistema a revelar las claves secretas que utiliza para permitir la instalación de software en la máquina.

Y un hacker de EE.UU., que ganó notoriedad tras desbloquear el iPhone, usó un método similar para extraer la clave maestra de la PS3 y publicarla en línea.

Sony rechazó hacer comentarios al respecto a pesar de que su producto es considerado uno de los más seguros del mercado.

""Toda la consola ha sido comprometida, no hay forma de recuperarse de esto"", dijo pytey, un miembro del grupo de hackers conocido como fail0verflow quienes revelaron la falla en diciembre en un congreso en Berlín, Alemania.

""Peor que esto es imposible. Alguien está enfrentando serios problemas en Sony en este momento"".

""Hackers"" contra la piratería

El grupo, que en el pasado ha alterado también la consola Wii de Nintendo y que asegura estar en contra de la piratería, afirma haber desarrollado el hack -o programa informático- para poder instalar otros sistemas operativos y software independiente -conocido como homebrew- en el poderoso dispositivo.

""Los detalles que dimos y la técnica e información que revelamos son suficientes como para instalar Linux"", aseguró. ""No nos interesa la piratería"".

Tras la presentación el hacker estadounidense George Hotz, quien ya había logrado modificar partes de la consola, usó una técnica similar para extraer la clave maestra y la publicó en su blog.

Ese número -que solía ser secreto- se utiliza para autorizar todos los juegos y programas que corren en el sistema de tal forma que Sony pueda comprobar que son genuinos.

Sin embargo, al conocerse la clave se puede instalar cualquier programa.

""Detesto que permita la piratería"", asegura Hotz. ""La publicación de la clave es más académica que otra cosa"".

La clave, según él, también funciona en la consola portátil PSP.

""Objetivo legítimo""

La PS3 -conocida como una de las consolas más seguras -y la única que no se podía alterar permanentemente- ha sido blanco de los hackers en los últimos 12 meses.

Pie de foto, Cuando Hotz quebró la seguridad de la consola, Sony desactivó algunas de sus características.

Fue Hotz quien logró romper su seguridad inicialmente obligando a Sony a liberar una actualización que impedía la instalación de versiones de Linux en la máquina, una de sus características más atractivas, pero vulnerables.

Dicha decisión por parte de Sony no sólo le acarreó críticas sino que además convirtió a la PS3 en un ""objetivo legítimo"" según los hackers.

""Esa fue nuestra motivación"" aseguró pytey a la BBC.

El equipo pasó meses tratando de alcanzar su objetivo. ""No fue una tarea trivial"", dijo.

Según él al final lograron su objetivo pues Sony cometió un error básico de criptografía permitiéndoles descifrar la clave.

¿Qué hara Sony?

Sony se toma muy en serio las modificaciones no autorizadas a su consola.

El año pasado salió al mercado una memoria USB llamada PSjailbreak que contenía un software que permitía usar juegos hechos en casa o ilegales en la consola.

Sony realizó una actualización a fin de bloquear dicha memoria y emprendió acciones legales contra los responsables en varios países.

You're hired! Facebook employs hacker who cracked iPhone and PlayStation 3 security codes



Hired: Facebook has employed hacker George Hotz - the 21-year-old published a way of running any software on the PS3 and cracked into the iPhone

Facebook has employed a hacker who published a way of running any software, including pirated games, on the PlayStation 3 and cracked into the iPhone.

George Hotz, 21, has been a software engineer at the social network since May 9.

A posting on his Facebook page last week read: 'Facebook is really an amazing place to work... first hackathon over.'



Just two months ago, Sony won a restraining order against him.

A California court ordered Hotz - also known as GeoHotz - to never again publish secret codes used by Sony to protect the PS3 from being used for unauthorised purposes.

He was also given ten days to hand over his computer equipment to Sony.

Sony then announced its intention to seek damages after claiming the hacks' publication is affecting sales of its PlayStation games.

In 2008, Hotz managed to unlock the iPhone and posted details of how to do so on a blog.

His biggest claim to notoriety was uncovering Sony's secret 'signing in' number for the PS3 earlier this year.

Making security codes widely available constitutes copyright infringement and computer fraud, Sony had argued in court papers filed in mid-January.

Among the secret codes is a key number used to 'sign' all PlayStation games to make sure they are genuine.

Once this information is known, it can be used to allow any software to run on the device, including pirated copies.

The PlayStation 3 had remained unhackable for the last few years until members of a hacking group called failOverflow accessed the information last month.

Just two months ago, a California court ordered Hotz to never again publish secret codes used by Sony to protect the PS3 from being used for unauthorised purposes

They then presented this information at the Chaos Communication Congress, an annual meeting of international hackers, in Berlin.

Hotz then revealed he had worked out the 'signing in' code.

Sony responded by taking legal action against 100 people, including Hotz, associated with the group. The failOverflow site was closed almost immediately and replaced with a message 'Sony sued us'.

A brief statement, also posted, read: 'We have never condoned, supported, approved of or encouraged videogame piracy.

'We have not published any encryption or signing keys. We have not published any Sony code, or code derived from Sony's code.'

But Sony disputed this and applied for a restraining order against Mr Hotz.

Legal papers filed in the Northern District Court of California read: 'Working individually and in concert with one another, the defendants recently bypassed effective technological protection measures employed by Sony.

'Through the internet, defendants are distributing software, tools and instructions that... facilitate the counterfeiting of video games.",2023-10-17 07:09:21.282919+00:00,True,True,True,True,0.9314883695179625,George Hotz: Facebook employs hacker who cracked iPhone and PlayStation 3 security - Daily Mail,,"The software failure occurred when hacker George Hotz published a way to run any software on the PlayStation 3 and cracked into the iPhone.

A lot of Android smartphones don't have an LED that can display color-coded alerts like the G1 or Nexus One. It's pretty handy to simply glance at your phone and already know if the alert you were out of earshot for is actually something important to check. NoLED is a useful little app that allows you to see a small colored dot or icon on your screen which will identify your different alerts received.

Note: It's recommended that you only use NoLED on AMOLED screens because it is not as battery-friendly on SLCD screens; however, it can be used on most handsets.

Step 1: Download and install NoLED from the Android Market.

Step 2: Enable NoLED on your phone.

After the app installs, you will need to either power cycle your phone or add the widget for NoLED to one of your Home screens. To add a widget: long-press on a Home screen with open space, choose Widgets, and then NoLED. Make sure the ""Switch NoLED on"" check box is marked when you open the app.

Step 3: Customize your color notifications and icons.

When you open the NoLED app there will be choices for Icons or Colors in the main menu. You can then choose which icons to use and which size you'd like, along with the colors assigned to individual alerts.

Choose which alerts will display as actual icons. Screenshot by Nicole Cozma

Once you're all set up, your results will look like one of the following:

Other features this app offers:

Battery-saving features: Timeouts can be set for notifications, the brightness of alert icons/colored dots can be adjusted, along with other options.

Sleep times: NoLED can be programmed not to display alerts between certain times of the day, especially when you're... sleeping.

Audio Reminder: If you miss alerts often, this is yet another fail safe to make sure you get your messages. The timer can be adjusted to sound off a custom-picked ringtone to let you know you missed an alert.

This app will even allow you to pick where the dots or icons will appear, and other settings associated with their movement and display on the phone's screen--and it's all free!

You may be wondering if this app will drain your battery. The simple answer is yes, but all apps will drain battery power the more you use them. Rendering an all-black screen with a small colored dot or icon doesn't drain as much as you'd think on an AMOLED screen, and is not likely to heavily affect your daily battery life.",2023-10-17 07:35:54.812256+00:00,True,False,,,,How to add LED-style alerts to your Android - CNET,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So what DID cause the Costa Concordia to hit the rocks? Human error, electrical failure and uncharted ridge are all theories

Advertisement

There's a scene in the disaster movie The Towering Inferno in which Steve McQueen’s fire chief rails against architects for building office blocks higher and higher with scant regard for public safety.

So what would he have made of the gigantic, floating hotels that pass for modern cruise liners? In the past decade, the size of the passenger ships cruising the world’s oceans has doubled.

The biggest of these monsters weigh more than 225,000 tons and carry more than 6,000 passengers.

Even the Costa Concordia is no minnow. As the 26th largest passenger ship in the world, its 13 passenger decks are stacked on a vessel nearly 1,000 ft long and 100ft high above the water. When it set sail from Italy on Friday, it resembled a floating office block, rather than a conventional ship.

For years, there have been concerns within the shipping industry that these ocean-going behemoths are too big, that their crews are poorly trained and that their officers are too reliant on electronic navigation aids.

Crucially experts have warned that the construction and safety standards in place for modern cruise ships were designed for vessels half their size. So how did the Costa Concordia come to capsize within yards of the shore? Last night there were at least three conflicting theories about what happened.

What is certain is that, soon after the voyage began, passengers heard a bang and the ship was plunged into darkness. The first theory is based on the captain’s account of events – that he hit an uncharted rock and reacted by bringing the vessel into safer shallow waters off the island of Giglio. There it was damaged again on rocks and rolled on to its side.



Under International Maritime Organisation rules, captains are supposed to use the ship itself as a ‘lifeboat’ and return to port for evacuation.

The second is that there was a massive electrical failure which affected the ship’s navigation equipment, or a computer failure that sent the navigation systems haywire causing it to go too close to shore where it hit the rocks.

A third theory is that it was old-fashioned human error – or even recklessness – that allowed the vessel to ground in shallow waters. The investigation will look into every decision, order and event that led up to the sinking and will take months to come to a conclusion. On paper, human error remains the prime suspect.



It is the main cause of 80 per cent of shipping accidents and the crew may simply have become distracted or lost concentration early on in the voyage, allowing the vessel to drift to the coast.

Human error? Francesco Schettino, captain of the Costa Concordia, is taken into police custody on Saturday

However, the Electronic Chart Display Information System – a computer based system that uses GPS and mapping to pinpoint a vessel’s location – should have sounded an alarm the moment the ship left its course.

If it didn’t, then it suggests human error was compounded by a computer failure.

One clue to what happened lies in the reports of an explosion and the failure of the ship’s lights. That points to an electrical failure, perhaps caused by a power surge which led to a malfunction in the ship’s generators.

The ship is powered by a bank of diesel engines which generate electricity to turn the propellers and power lights and heating on board. The power surge could have led to an explosion in the engine room – causing the lights to fail, the engines to shut down and the steering to stop working.

If that happened close to shore, the ship could have run into rocks. The systems are designed to come back on, but it takes time, and there might not have been enough.

A similar failure hit the Queen Mary 2 in September 2010 as it approached Barcelona. On that occasion, there were no hazards nearby so there was no immediate danger and the engines were working again within half an hour.

Maritime safety expert Phil Anderson had experience of a power failure in the North Atlantic years ago on a cargo ship.

‘The chief engineer got to the engine room and restarted the engine – but it didn’t give us back the steering,’ he said. ‘So the engine went on and the revs started building up. The ship turned around sideways to the wind and waves, a highly dangerous position.’

Alternatively, maritime safety expert Alan Graveson believes the captain may have indeed have hit an uncharted rock as he claims, and although the ship would have had an echo sounder to detect unforeseen objects, the warning of approaching rocks could have come to late to do anything about it.

Italian coast guard divers search for survivors still trapped inside the vessel, as rescue operations continue on the Costa Concordia yesterday

Uncharted rocks seem unlikely in busy waters off Italy. But there is a precedent.

In April 2007, a cruise ship called the Sea Diamond struck a reef in Greek waters and sank, killing two passengers. A survey later found that the reef was not charted correctly on official maps. Mr Graveson said: ‘If that’s what happened in this case the captain would have headed to land and might have hit more rocks as the ship approached the coast.’

A ship the size of the Costa Concordia is unable to float if water is less than 26ft deep – which explains why it so quickly turned on its side. But if it had sunk in deep water, hundreds could have died.

Whatever the cause, Mr Graveson believes the accident highlights a widespread problem with the new generation of massive cruise ships.

They may be more vulnerable when they take in water, and more likely to list. They are certainly tricky to steer. Crews complain that they are like trying to steer a block of flats and that they are vulnerable to side wind. They are also harder to evacuate. What little outdoor deck space is available becomes more and more crowded as extra storeys of cabins are added to the design.

Surrounded by an flotilla of rescue boats, the stricken Costa Concordia lists to its starboard side off the coast of the island of Giglio in this picture taken on Saturday

And ironically – 100 years since Titanic – there are concerns about lifeboats. Andrew Linington, of the union Nautilus UK, said lifeboats on ships had barely moved on since 1912.

Boats are still lowered on wires and if the vessel is listing badly, half are unusable. In contrast, oil rigs already use escape capsules, or ‘free fall lifeboats’ – enclosed pods that drop into the water from a sloping ramp. They are quicker to use and do not need to be lowered on wires.

Experts stress, however, that despite the weekend’s shocking events, accidents remain rare.

Cruise operator plagued by near misses

By CLAIRE ELLICOTT

From its humble beginnings as an Italian family firm, Costa has risen to become Europe’s top cruise operator. But it has been plagued by a history of accidents and scandal aboard its 15 ships.



One collision caused the deaths of three crew members, while a near-miss prompted an investigation into the company and its safety record.



And in 2008, the Costa Concordia hit the dockside in Palermo, Sicily, in bad weather, causing damage to the bow, though no one was hurt. It is not known whether the same captain was sailing it.



Crew members inspect the damage on the Costa Classica in Shanghai, after it collided with a Belgian cargo ship, Lowlands Longevity, whilst entering the port in October 2010

More seriously, the Costa Europa crashed in 2008 as its captain tried to dock at Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt in high winds, killing three crew and injuring four passengers.



At the time, an unnamed maritime official blamed ‘100 per cent human error’, but Costa insisted bad weather was the cause. Later that year, power failure was blamed for the Costa Classica smashing into a cargo vessel in China’s Yangtze River, injuring three people.



The cruise line has also been plagued by reports of ineffective equipment and scandal.



In 2008, the Costa Atlantica developed steering problems. Separately, a crew member was arrested on a charge of possessing and importing child pornography.



The following year, the cruise line was fined £23,000 for deceptive advertising and there was a near-mutiny on the Costa Europa over engine problems.



There was also a fire on the Costa Romantica in the generator room which led to 1,429 passengers being evacuated.



The Costa Atlantica was involved in a near miss with a car transporter in the Channel in 2009 which led to criticism from the UK Marine Accident Investigation Branch

Costa’s safety record was called into question after a near-miss in the Channel in 2008. The crew of the Costa Atlantica almost collided with a car transporter and was criticised by the UK Marine Accident Investigation Branch in an official report for failing to obey the waterway’s strict two-way traffic system.



Costa began as a cargo shipping firm but carried passengers from 1947. In 2000 it was bought by Carnival Corporal, the world’s largest cruise operator which also owns Cunard Line and P&O Cruises in the UK.

Microsoft's online store in India was hacked on Sunday, resulting in the theft of usernames and passwords of the site's customers.

A Chinese group of hackers calling itself Evil Shadow Team took credit for the hack, posting screenshots of obscured usernames and passwords that it found unencrypted on the site, according to Reuters. The group touted the attack on its own blog (here's an English translation). posting a screenshot of the hacked Web site with the message: ""Unsafe system will be baptized.""

Microsoft has since taken down the hacked site and replaced it with a message telling users that ""The Microsoft Store India is currently unavailable. Microsoft is working to restore access as quickly as possible.""

Microsoft confirmed the news in the following statement sent to CNET:

Microsoft is investigating the limited compromise of the company's online store in India. Customers have been notified and provided with guidance to reset their passwords. We are diligently working to remedy the incident and keep our customers protected.

Since the passwords were stored in clear text and not encrypted, customers who've purchased items through the site are at risk.

A report in the Times of India is advising users to change their passwords as soon as the site comes back online. And if they've used the same credentials at other sites, they're urged to change those as well.

No details were revealed as to why the group targeted Microsoft's Indian site or how they hacked their way in. But unencrypted passwords are highly valued by hackers, who can frequently use them to break into other--sometimes more vital--accounts if users have reused their passwords (as they all-too frequently do). It also shows a surprising lack of security for a company like Microsoft.

10745,[],2012-03-07 08:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnet.com/news/privacy/disillusioned-ex-anonymous-first-outed-sabu-last-year/,https://www.cnet.com,,"Published on 2012-03-07 08:00:00+00:00. The trail to the New York apartment where a hacker named ""Sabu"" of LulzSec and Anonymous fame was arrested last June can be traced back to a former Anonymous participant who turned against the group over its WikiLeaks activities.

Sabu, whose name is Hector Xavier Monsegur, pleaded guilty to computer hacking charges in August and spent the last six months or so working as an informant for the FBI. The undercover operation led to hacking-related charges being filed against four alleged cohorts in the U.K., Ireland, and Chicago yesterday.

Sabu was the proverbial big fish who was admired among other hackers and hailed as an online freedom fighter. And unmasking him became a favorite hobby for rivals last year. But it was Jennifer Emick, after being harassed online for criticizing Anonymous' hacking activities, who was the first to match a face and real name with the well-known hacker handle.

""It took me four hours to find Sabu,"" Emick told CNET today.

It was February 2011 when she and her partners at Backtrace Security compiled a list of identities they believed were tied to the hacker handles associated with the HBGary Federal hack and others. Her break with discovering Sabu's identity came to her from a friend in the group in the form of log files from an Internet Relay Chat room in which Sabu and other LulzSec members discussed the HBGary Federal compromise, she said. One of the log files contained a domain that led to a subdomain that had a mirror to a page where Monsegur posted photos and video of his beloved Toyota AE86 on a car enthusiast social-networking site. That led to a YouTube video that had information that allowed Emick to eventually find Monsegur's Facebook page using a Google search.

Shortly after Backtrace Security posted the list of alleged hacker identities on the Web in March 2011, it got a call from the FBI asking it to remove the list and pass the information on to the feds, Emick said.

Backtrace Security has been following Sabu's activities and communicating with the feds since then but was not involved in the investigation enough to know that Sabu had agreed to turn over his fellow hackers. But Emick said she suspected something was up when Sabu disappeared from IRC for more than a week in June and from Twitter for almost a month.

She speculated that the FBI maintained the undercover operation long enough for Sabu to re-establish trust after his disappearance and to allow them time to gather evidence that would be needed to prosecute his colleagues.

FBI officials did not return calls seeking comment for this story. The FBI was able to warn some of the hacking group's targets and alerted 300 government and private entities globally to potential holes in their computer systems, Fox News reported. Agents even ordered Sabu to call hackers off a planned attack on the CIA's public Web site, the report says. ""You're knocking over a bee's nest,"" he warned them. ""Stop.""

But it's unclear what was going on with the compromise of global intelligence firm Stratfor in December. The hackersin that attack and released them on the Web.

Asked why she thinks the feds didn't or weren't able to interfere with the Stratfor hack, Emick speculated that it could have been an elaborate sting to get the hackers to show their hand, or that Stratfor ""fell on its sword on purpose"" because the company seemed to know about the breach the day it happened.

Stratfor provided this comment when contacted by CNET: """"Stratfor applauds the hard work of the law enforcement organizations involved in the investigation. As the matter now moves through the judicial system, we will stay focused on working to recover from the episode.""

Things started getting fishy again when he Sabu ""took off"" about five weeks ago, Emick said, declining to reveal more specifics. Then some Austrian and German hackers became suspicious about Sabu a couple of weeks ago and set up their own server despite his entreaties that they use his server because theirs was owned by the U.S. feds, according to Emick. Then on Monday night hackers started deleting their hard drives because they knew something was up with Sabu, she said.

Many Anonymous participants are shocked and angered by the news that Sabu had turned on his compatriots. And some are probably eating crow that Emick was right about Sabu's identity after all.

""The path to the data looks like Backtrace Security,"" said Gregg Housh, an Internet activist and former Anonymous supporter who still observes the group. ""That bothers a lot of people because none of us like them.""

But Housh reserved his harshest criticism for the FBI, which he accused of relying on ""very old-school tactics"" in their investigations. ""They take down the most vocal guy and hope that gets everyone to stop,"" he said. ""It won't. That's not how the Internet works.""

Emick seems to think the strategy works and is doing her part to help. ""I've recruited like nine active informants on my on, so who knows how many there are really,"" she said.

After three years of restoration the Stabian Baths complex in the buried ancient Roman city of Pompeii have finally reopened.



The work has seen the frescoes restored and walkways built to allow visitors to move easily between the men and women section of the baths which date back to the 5th Century BC.



Officials said that the restoration work - which had been interrupted twice after cases of collapse elsewhere in Pompeii had cost more than one million Euros - and that for the first time it allowed access to the women section of the Stabian Baths.



Reopened: The Stabian Baths of Pompeii are one of the world's most famous archaeological sites and Italy's top tourist attraction

At last: The baths were reopened on the occasion of the International Women's Day after a recent renovation

VIP: Women were allowed free entry to the restored baths on International Women's Day

To mark the opening on Thursday's International Women's Day, officials allowed women free access into the section and hundreds of tourists took advantage of the offer as they poured into Pompeii which was buried by an eruption in AD79 by nearby Mt Vesuvius.



Over the centuries the site has thrown up an extraordinary array of discoveries and the well preserved remains have allowed historians and tourists into what life under ancient Rome was like 2,000 years ago - although there have been complaints that parts of the site have fallen into disrepair.

The Stabian Baths complex is the oldest of three thermal bath sites that are situated in Pompei and all are divided into men's and women's sections with each having a apodyterium (changing room), frigidarium (cold bath room), tedpidarium (tepid bath room) and caldarium (hot bath room).



For all to see: A plaster cast of the remains of a citizen of Pompeii is seen in the baths

Feature: A damaged statue at the baths will be once again on show to the general public

There was also a sophisticated toilet system and a gym for use of patrons and pictures from the newly restored women's section showed showed stone slabs which would have been used for massages or relaxing by Roman noble women.



Elsewhere there was a large plunge circular plunge pool which was surrounded by alcoves and murals, with a large domed roof above allowing in light.



Capture that: A tourist take pictures of human remains inside the Thermae Stabianae, the most famous bath

Treasure it: Interior view of the Stabian Baths, where it is hoped the site will be respected by visitors

Heating in the complex was provided via a series of pipes which pumped hot and cold water into channels in the walls and floors of the rooms which were not only a public role but also a central meeting point for Roman society.



Antonio Varone, Pompei's director, said:'We are delighted that we are finally able to open the women's section of the Stabian Baths which has never been seen before by the public. To mark the day we allowed women free access into the site and they were very interested and pleased with what they saw.'

When it comes to lethal bugs, the computer glitch that set fire to $440 million of Knight Capital Group's funds last Wednesday ranks right up there with the tsetse fly.

In less than an hour, Knight Capital's computers executed a series of automatic orders that were supposed to be spread out over a period of days. Millions of shares changed hands. The resulting loss, which was nearly four times the company's 2011 profit, crippled the firm and brought it to the edge of bankruptcy. Knight (KCG) only survived after a group of investors swooped in with a $400 million lifeline.

Reversing the errant trades cost almost half a billion dollars. Which raises the question: Where does this fall on the all-time list of history's most expensive computer meltdowns?

There have been a few epic debacles. For instance, in all the excitement of Monday's Mars rover landing, people have largely forgotten the fiascos of previous Mars missions.

In 1999, NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter overshot its target when trying to move into orbit around the red planet. It burned up in the atmosphere. The reason: One engineering team working on the spacecraft used metric measurements while another team used Imperial units.

Later that year, the Mars Polar Lander crashed due to a malfunction that caused it to shut down its main engines before it had reached the planet surface. Total cost of the two failures: $357 million.

Other space agencies have had their own meltdowns. The 1996 maiden flight of the European Space Agency's state-of-the-art Ariane 5 rocket ended in a spectacular explosion over French Guiana. The rocket's inertial guidance system failed to convert a piece of data from a 64-bit format to a 16-bit format. Estimates on the cost of the lost rocket and cargo run to $500 million.

Then there was the 2003 blackout in North America, which deprived an estimated 50 million people of power. The blackout was made possible by a bug in General Electric's Unix-based monitoring software that kept operators from learning of a local power outage. The glitch's domino effect cut off power in eight U.S. states and in Ontario, Canada.

""Computers do what they're told,"" says Lawrence Pingree, an analyst at Gartner. ""If they're told to do the wrong thing, they're going to do it and they're going to do it really, really well.""

The cost of some IT failures has climbed into the billions. Last year news broke that the U.S. Army's $2.7 billion cloud-computing system for intelligence sharing among troop commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan was all but useless.

""Almost any commercial solution out there would be better,"" one analyst told Politico.

The single most expensive computer problem of all time may be the Y2K bug. Research firm IDC estimated that U.S. businesses, government agencies and individuals spent nearly $200 billion dealing with the problem.

The costs for such huge, systemic issues are hard to pin down. One widely cited study on the 2003 blackout puts its total cost at around $6 billion. Most of that price tag, though, comes from ""lost income,"" a hard-to-measure variable.

When computer bugs affect the financial markets -- something that's happening more and more often -- the losses can be tallied precisely.

Investment firm AXA Rosenberg shelled out $217 million last year to cover investor losses from what it called a ""significant error"" in the computer code for one of its investment models. It paid an extra $25 million penalty to regulators after it was caught trying to hide the mistake.

Nasdaq is still dealing with the fallout of its glitch-plagued Facebook (FB) IPO. The exchange operator earmarked $62 million for reimbursing investors and says it expects to incur significant costs beyond that for system upgrades and legal battles. Investors say their actual losses are much higher that what Nasdaq plans to cover; Knight Capital, for example, says it lost $35 million.

Some glitches have taken down entire markets. Derivatives trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange stopped for 95 minutes on Tuesday morning after a computer glitch was found to be affecting a crucial server. The day before, Spanish exchange Bolsas y Mercados Españoles was halted for five hours because of a glitch.

Stock markets have become increasingly vulnerable to bugs over the last decade thanks to financial firms' growing reliance on high-speed computerized trading. Because the trading is automated, there's nobody to apply the brakes if things go wrong.

""The growing complexity is a huge contributor,"" says Pingree, a former currency trader. ""You really can't have proper risk management until you have visibility.""

He's not optimistic that things will get better unless government regulators step in to slow down most trading activity. Financial firms and stock exchanges test new software, but in trading, ""the risk universe could change so dramatically within minutes that it's not humanly possible"" to plan for every eventuality, he says.",2023-10-17 22:24:29.393794+00:00,True,True,False,,,Is Knight's $440 million glitch the costliest computer bug ever? - CNN.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sony's PlayStation console has suffered a significant breach, with hackers releasing a decryption key that could make it easier for people to play pirated games on their consoles, without sacrificing a connection to the PlayStation Network.

The 'LV0' decryption keys, which enable any Sony software updates to be cracked in the future, were released by hacker collective The Three Musketeers, the BBC reports. In a post, the group says it released the key because rival hackers were planning on selling the same PlayStation hacking tool for a fee.

Hacker News explains that Sony uses those encryption keys to protect the PS3's firmware, and verify any new updates.

Now that they're out in the open, any future patches or software updates from Sony could be cracked too, meaning the Japanese tech giant's console may never be safe from piracy again. I've asked Sony for a statement on the matter, and the BBC says the PS3-maker is due to speak out shortly.

It's been a mixed day for Sony. While its console has been compromised, a US judge has thrown out a bunch of lawsuits brought against the corporation in the wake of the PSN data breach last year.

The class action suit was filed in June, and complained that Sony had ""failed to follow basic industry-standard protocols to safeguard its customers' personal and financial information,"" CNET reports. A Californian judge was unsympathetic however, and charges have been dismissed.

During a four-month long cyberattack by Chinese hackers on the New York Times, the company's antivirus software missed 44 of the 45 pieces of malware installed by attackers on the network.

That's a stunning wake-up call to people and businesses who think they are fully protected by their antivirus software.

""Even the most modern version of antivirus software doesn't give consumers or enterprises what they need to compete in the hacker world,"" said Dave Aitel, CEO of security consultancy Immunity. ""It's just not as effective as it needs to be.""

The New York Times said it had an antivirus system from Symantec (SYMC) installed on devices connected to its network. The Chinese hackers built custom malware to, among other things, retrieve the usernames and passwords of Times' reporters. Since that brand-new malware wasn't on Symantec's list of forbidden software, most of it was allowed to pass through undetected.

Symantec responded that it offers more advanced solutions than the one the New York Times (NYT) deployed.

""Advanced attacks like the ones the New York Times described underscore how important it is for companies, countries and consumers to make sure they are using the full capability of security solutions,"" the company said in a written statement. ""Antivirus software alone is not enough.""

Related story: Nations prepare for cyber war

The cold fact is that no single solution can prevent all cyberthreats. Sophisticated attacks on networks routinely bypass network security systems, no matter how rock-solid they are -- or claim to be.

""Commercially available solutions are available to everyone,"" said Rohit Sethi, head of product development for SD Elements, a security firm. ""It's not hard for attackers to learn how to evade detection, and they're coming up with ingenious ways of doing just that.""

The solution, security experts say, is to deploy technology that keeps a very, very close eye on what's happening inside your network. You can't always prevent attackers from getting in, but you can at least set tripwires to alert you when they do.

In the New York Times' case, the company suspected that it would be attacked because of its investigation into Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao's family finances. It asked AT&T (T) to monitor its network. AT&T quickly picked up suspicious signs. Two weeks later, when the extent of the infiltration became clear, the Times hired security consultancy Mandiant to track the attackers' movements through its systems.

""Attackers no longer go after our firewall,"" Michael Higgins, the Times' chief security officer, told Times reporter Nicole Perlroth. ""They go after individuals. They send a malicious piece of code to your e-mail account and you're opening it and letting them in.""

From there, the best thing companies can do is track what attackers are doing.

""The question we always ask our customers is, 'Do you know every program running on your network?"" said Immunity's Aitel. ""When you know the answer to that question, you don't need antivirus software. When you don't, you're screwed.""

Experts say that antivirus software is still a good, basic thing to have. Owning an antivirus solution is like putting the Club in your car -- it's not going to stop a determined thief, but it's going to make stealing your stuff more difficult.

Antivirus software maker Avast, whose free antivirus software is among the most widely used, says there's a major distinction between the kinds of threats encountered by everyday Web surfers and the carefully targeted attack the Times faced.

""Seatbelts and airbags are wonderful protection and improve the safety of millions, but they will not stop a bullet fired -- say by a hired killer,"" said Jindrich Kubec, Avast's threat intelligence director. ""Does it mean you will stop using airbags and seatbelts?""

Some antivirus solutions are better than others. In a recent analysts, Immunity simulated attacks against networks protected by the top-of-the-line software built by Symantec, Kaspersky Labs and Intel's (INTC) McAfee security division.

Immunity was able to break into the systems protected by Kaspersky and McAfee in two days. Symantec was the best of the breed, with Immunity unable to penetrate it in the several days it gave itself to achieve the task.

""New reputational-based software works to an extent,"" Aitel said, referring to systems that aim to contextualize the threats they detect. ""But deep down, nothing is as good has having a proper awareness about what's going on in your network.""",2023-10-19 00:42:17.774862+00:00,True,True,True,True,0.8530300590566793,Your antivirus software probably won't prevent a cyberattack - CNN.com,Antivirus Software Fails to Detect Chinese Hackers on New York Times Network,"The software failure incident occurred during a four-month long cyberattack by Chinese hackers on the New York Times.

The Wi-Fi router you use to broadcast a private wireless Internet signal in your home or office is not only easy to hack, says a report released today, but the best way to protect yourself is out of your hands.

The report, written by research firm Independent Security Evaluators of Baltimore, found that 13 of the most popular off-the-shelf wireless routers could be exploited by a ""moderately skilled adversary with LAN or WLAN access."" It also concludes that your best bet for safer Wi-Fi depends on router vendors upping their game. All 13 routers evaluated can be taken over from the local network, with four of those requiring no active management session. Eleven of the 13 can be taken over from a Wide-Area Network (WAN) such as a wireless network, with two of those requiring no active management session.

My router's not safe? Really?

""It is not a safe assumption to make that you're safe,"" Steve Bono, the company's CEO and principal security analyst, told CNET in a phone interview.

The report notes that all 14 of the devices had critical security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by a ""remote adversary"" and could lead to unauthorized remote control of the router.

Before you dismiss router hacks as exceptionally rare, it's important to note that they've been a small but growing segment of computer security threats. In 2011, one firmware vulnerability affecting six hardware manufacturers combined with two malicious scripts and 40 malicious DNS servers to attack 4.5 million Brazilian DSL modems, with the goal of stealing bank and credit card information.

Craig Heffner, a vulnerability analyst at Maryland-based Tactical Network Solutions, said that he isn't familiar with the Brazil story but isn't surprised by it. ""In a lot of countries, there's only one or two ISPs, and you get whatever router they give you,"" he said. ""They often enable remote administration by default, so any vulnerability would be amplified.""

And just yesterday, ReadWrite reported on wireless router hacking, based in part on research conducted by security firm Rapid7. ISE's study, while similar, reports ""all-new findings,"" said ISE's marketing head, Ted Harrington.

Harrington further explained why router hacking could turn into a big problem. ""What's notable about this is that if you compromise the router, then you're inside the firewall. You can pick credit card numbers out of e-mails, confidential documents, passwords, photos, just about anything,"" he said.

He added that ISE plans to release additional information from the study in the coming weeks, following the routine security community best practice of giving vendors a chance to respond to vulnerabilities that have been uncovered before publishing them.

""We notified all vendors about all vulnerabilities that we found,"" said ISE security analyst Jake Holcomb. ""We're in the process of receiving Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) numbers"" for tracking information security vulnerabilities.

Some vendors, Holcomb said, got back to ISE quickly and had beta firmware with fixes ready to test within 72 hours. ""Other vendors escalated their Tier 1 support up the chain but we never heard back from them,"" he said.",2023-10-19 03:45:27.089985+00:00,True,True,True,True,0.8975881475498203,"Top Wi-Fi routers easy to hack, says study - CNET",,"The software failure occurred in 13 popular off-the-shelf wireless routers.

If you have grown to like the live tiles and Metro interface of Windows 8's Start screen, then you might like to know that you can bring similar functionality to Chrome's new tab page.

Install the New MetroTab extension and the next time you open a new tab in Chrome, you'll be greeted by groups of colorful tiles that look and act a lot like those that populate the Windows 8 Start screen. New MetroTab starts you off with a number of tiles for commonly accessed sites, including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and the like, along with some Chrome extensions you have installed and Web services you might use such as Flickr, Evernote, Google Drive, and Outlook. The extension is customizable and makes it easy to delete the tiles you don't want, add new ones, and reorder them.

Screenshot by Matt Elliott/CNET

Moving a tile is as simple as clicking on it and dragging it to a new spot. Right-click on a tile and a menu bar appears along the bottom of the screen, where you can delete the tile or change the size of its icon, the icon itself, its background color, and its label.

To add a new tile, click your profile in the upper-right corner and select Add tile. Just enter the URL and the label and icon should populate automatically. (The extension grabs a site's favicon for its tile icon.) You can also enter your own label and choose a file for its icon, should you want or need to.

Also from your profile you can access the options menu, which you can use to tweak the look of the background pattern and color scheme of the New MetroTab page, add your location for the weather tile, and enable touch support, which the developer states is an experimental option because he does not have a touchscreen for testing.

On my MacBook Pro, the extension works well and loads quickly. I experienced only the occasional glitch where it failed to launch properly, and closing the tab and opening a new tab quickly corrected the issue each time.

Sometimes more is not better, at least for a while. Case in point: the AiCloud feature of Asus' USB-enabled routers.

In my last review of an Asus router, the RT-AC66U , I found the device to be one of the best 802.11ac routers on the market, which it still is now. Among other things, the router's USB-connected storage feature was one of the most comprehensive, offering convenient data sharing, media streaming, and so on.

A month after my review, Asus moved to add even more to the router by introducing the AiCloud feature together with firmware version 3.0.0.4.220. This feature added cloud-based sharing and mobile-app support for the router's USB-connected storage. Unfortunately, at the same time, AiCloud also created a series of vulnerabilities, first reported by security expert Kyle Lovett, that could potentially allow hackers to take control of the router remotely.

According to Lovett, it seems the best way to avoid this risk has been to turn off the AiCloud feature, or better yet not use an external hard drive with the router at all. That's not the case anymore, at least with RT-AC66U and the RT-N66U .

Asus informed me today that firmware version 3.0.4.372 patches all AiCloud-related bugs as well as improving the functionality of both routers.

Here's part of the release notes for the latest firmware:

Fixed AiCloud-vulnerability-related bugs. Underline ""_"" can now be acceptable in device name and computer name. Hide Broadcast option in PPTP VPN server when it is disabled. Fixed multicast IPTV related issues in PPPoE/PPTP/L2TP connection. Fixed parental control offset issue in IE. Fixed 3G dongle-related issue. Hide ASUS DDNS description when selecting third-party service. Fixed script error 'invalid argument on IE.' Fixed smart-sync JS error. Fixed JST time zone issue.

I tried the new firmware with the RT-AC66U, and so far it has seemed the router is now secure with AiCloud turned on. Note that the new firmware was not available when I checked from within the router's Web interface. In other words, I had to download it from Asus' Web site and upgrade the router manually. So, here are the support links and available dates of the firmware for routers affected by the AiCloud bugs.

If you're not using the AiCloud feature, there's nothing to worry about; if you are, make sure to turn that feature off till the router is updated with firmware version 3.0.4.372 or later.",2023-10-19 07:04:17.636933+00:00,True,True,True,True,0.9474027030850727,Asus patches its Wi-Fi routers' AiCloud vulnerabilities - CNET,,"The software failure occurred with the introduction of the AiCloud feature in Asus' USB-enabled routers, specifically the RT-AC66U and the RT-N66U.

It may be news to you that some Asus wireless routers leave your computer and networked drives open to hackers, but Asus has known about the problems for months, reports indicate.

The vulnerabilities make it possible for hackers to access directories on networked drives using Asus' proprietary AiCloud option. Enabling features such as ""Cloud Disk,"" ""Smart Access,"" and ""Smart Sync"" appear to enable the vulnerability, security researcher Kyle Lovett told Ars Technica.

Enabling the file-sharing tool Samba in the router also exposes the vulnerability to hackers.

Lovett told CNET that following his report of a related vulnerability in June that exposes hard drives of computers connected to the affected Asus routers, he reported to Asus representative Nick Mijuskovic the newer flaw to Asus in both September and November to no avail.

""I only received a reply of we'll look into it,"" Lovett wrote in an e-mail.

Asus did not immediately respond when asked for comment. CNET will update the story when we hear back from the company.

Two weeks ago, suspected hackers posted a list of more than 13,000 IP addresses gleaned from vulnerable Asus routers.

The vulnerability affects nearly a dozen Asus routers, including the RT-AC66R, RT-AC66U, RT-N66R, RT-N66U, RT-AC56U, RT-N56R, RT-N56U, RT-N14U, RT-N16, and RT-N16R. Apparently, Asus has released a firmware update that patches the vulnerabilities, but owners of those routers will have to manually install the update by going to the Asus site and following their instructions.

Jacob Holcomb, a security researcher at Independent Security Evaluators who uncovered widespread Wi-Fi router vulnerabilities first reported by CNET last year, said that the prevention of these kinds of attacks depends on the router vendor, and not the end user.

""These types of attacks could be prevented if security was a higher priority in the router manufacturers software development life cycle,"" Holcomb said. ""At the end of the day, this is just the tip of the iceberg; with the amount of vulnerable network hardware comprising the internet infrastructure, people should count on more large scale attacks.""

Both Holcomb and Lovett pointed to ongoing problems with routers. Linksys, for example, has struggled with vulnerabilities beyond the self-replicating malware afflicting some of its Wi-Fi routers.

Since last year, Wi-Fi routers have found themselves in the cross-hairs of researchers becoming increasingly aware of their inherent weaknesses.

These security problems with home wireless routers -- devices specifically designed to connect the Internet to your phone, tablet, and computer -- underscore the difficulty that makers of devices just now gaining Internet connectivity will face in keeping hackers out of their connected home products in the years ahead.",2023-10-19 17:08:09.034530+00:00,True,True,True,True,0.8057970592962632,Asus router vulnerabilities go unfixed despite reports - CNET,Asus Wireless Routers Vulnerable to Hackers: Software Failure Incident,"The software failure incident occurred with Asus wireless routers.

Samsung doesn't provide adequate security protection with the fingerprint sensor on its new Galaxy S5 smartphone -- at least that's the contention of a group of researchers who were able to hack their way past the sensor.

In a video of the hack, a researcher from Security Research Labs demonstrated how he was able to bypass the fingerprint security by using a ""wood glue spoof"" made from a mold taken from a photo of a fingerprint smudge left on a smartphone screen. The hack itself employed the same technique used to hack past the fingerprint scanner in Apple's iPhone 5S last year.

But the S5 was given a thumbs-down by the researchers for one critical flaw. The fingerprint scanner allows for multiple incorrect attempts without requring a password. So someone could potentially keep trying one fingerprint spoof after another until access is finally achieved.

The Galaxy S5's fingerprint scan can also be associated with certain secure apps and services. So once the initial scan gains entry to the phone, someone can open an app such as PayPal with no further security or identification required. As shown in the video, the person is able to log in to PayPal, giving him the ability to access the owner's account.

SRLabs is a Berlin-based security research and consulting think tank that has investigated mobile networks, SIM cards, payment terminals, and other systems for security issues.

""Despite being one of the premium phone's flagship features, Samsung's implementation of fingerprint authentication leaves much to be desired,"" the researcher in the video said. ""The finger scanner feature in Samsung's Galaxy S5 raises additional security concerns to those already voiced about comparable implementations.""

In response to SRLabs' findings, PayPal issued the following statement:

""While we take the findings from Security Research Labs very seriously, we are still confident that fingerprint authentication offers an easier and more secure way to pay on mobile devices than passwords or credit cards. PayPal never stores or even has access to your actual fingerprint with authentication on the Galaxy S5. The scan unlocks a secure cryptographic key that serves as a password replacement for the phone. We can simply deactivate the key from a lost or stolen device, and you can create a new one. PayPal also uses sophisticated fraud and risk management tools to try to prevent fraud before it happens. However, in the rare instances that it does, you are covered by our purchase protection policy.""

CNET contacted Samsung for comment and will update the story with any further details.

32055,[],2014-11-21 08:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnet.com/reviews/apple-iphone-6-review/,https://www.cnet.com,,"Published on 2014-11-21 08:00:00+00:00. Editors' note: On September 7, 2016, Apple debuted the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and discontinued the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus remain available, however, and Apple has increased the storage capacity of the entry-level models to 32GB and lowered their prices to $549 and $649, respectively. The full iPhone 6 review, first published in September 2014, updated to include a CNET Editor's Choice designation in November 2014, and then updated in Summer 2015, follows.

The Good The iPhone 6 delivers a spacious, crisp 4.7-inch screen, improved wireless speeds, better camera autofocus, and bumped-up storage capacities to 128GB at the top end. iOS remains a top-notch mobile operating system with an excellent ecosystem of apps, and Apple Pay is a smooth, secure payment system. The Bad Battery life isn't much better than it is on last year's iPhone 5S. And there's wasted space: an even larger screen could have been squeezed into the same housing. The Bottom Line The iPhone 6 is an exceptional phone in nearly every way except its average battery life: it's thin, fast, and features the excellent iOS operating system. It was the best overall phone introduced in 2014.

In 2014, Apple forked its iPhone product line, simultaneously introducing the next generation of its flagship model -- the iPhone 6 -- and debuting its super-sized sibling, the iPhone 6 Plus. The iPhone 6 is an exceptional phone in nearly every way but for its middling battery life. The iPhone 6 Plus is also impressive; larger and thinner than other iPhone models, and with the capacity for far more endurance on a single charge than most comparably-sized and smaller competitors.

When choosing between the 6 and 6 Plus, in the end, it's a matter of personal preference. I know several people who love the iPhone 6 Plus, with its larger screen size and better battery life. But the iPhone 6 feels best in my hand. It's thin, elegant, performs really well, and is considerably less expensive than the 6 Plus. For that reason, I think the smaller iPhone 6 is the way to go for most people.

Design

The iPhone 6's thin, all-metal aesthetic makes for one of the sleekest designs in the smartphone universe. This iPhone is only slightly thinner than the previous model but feels more so; this is due to the increased screen size and curved design. Glass from the front folds ever so slightly around the edges -- a departure from the sharp industrial edges of the iPhone 5 and 5S. It also feels a little like the original iPhone , which had a rounded design. But that phone was chunkier, with a far smaller screen. It felt like holding a pebble. The iPhone 6 is flat and thin, like a slab.

CNET

The iPhone 6 feels good to hold, beautifully solid, with a smooth, metal back and glass front. But it has an aura of fragility -- maybe it's the extra-slim look, or the massive pane of curved glass on the front. I instantly wanted to slip it into a case just to be safe. Early reports of bending iPhones may have been overblown. Consumer Reports' testing found that the new iPhones can withstand less pressure than the iPhone 5, LG G3 and Samsung Galaxy Note 3 , but are about as equally durable as the HTC One M8. In other words, it's not exactly delicate, but, like any other phone, it can be damaged -- so handle with care, and get a case for it.

The camera lens on the back of the iPhone 6 protrudes slightly, which made me worry about setting the phone down on rough surfaces, despite the fortitude of the sapphire lens. Again: using a case will alleviate any concerns.

The volume buttons, which were round and raised on previous iPhones, are elongated on the 6, similar to those on the iPod Touch and iPad. The power/sleep button has shifted to the right, making it easier to find in my experience.

CNET

A round Touch ID home button is located underneath the display; a simple press on the fingerprint reader unlocks the phone, and works amazingly well most of the time. While this feature is no longer as novel as it was when it debuted, Touch ID remains quicker and more reliable than the fingerprint detection capabilities we've seen on other smartphones. And with iOS 8, you can use fingerprint access for a wide variety of apps beyond the lock screen and iTunes Store.

The 2013 Moto X (left), iPhone 6 (center), Nexus 5 (right). See what I mean? CNET

If I have one problem with the new design, it's the bezel around the display. It's still big -- bigger than that of most Android phones, which means that the iPhone 6, with its 4.7-inch screen, is the same size as other phones with 5-inch screens. For example, the iPhone 6 runs as tall and wide the Nexus 5 , which has a larger 5-inch screen; it's also larger than the 2013 Moto X, which fits a comparable 4.7-inch display into a more compact body. (Both the old Moto X and Nexus 5 are thicker, however.) The iPhone 6 measures 5.4 by 2.6 inches, and 0.3 inch thick (138 by 67 by 69mm). It weighs 4.5 ounces, or 128 grams.

CNET

Though the iPhone 6 is basically one-hand friendly (and certainly more so than the iPhone 6 Plus), it comes with a useful but weird software feature called Reachability that pulls the top half of the display down to midscreen with a light double-tap of the Home button, for easier thumb access.

The screen

iPhones have always had phenomenal displays, both in terms of brightness and color quality. In CNET's battery of tests, we found that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus's screens are even better than those on previous iPhones, with superior grayscale and contrast levels.

Though phones with OLED displays, like the Samsung Galaxy S5 , deliver more vivid contrast and slightly richer, if less accurate, color, the iPhone 6's 4.7-inch IPS display is excellent: vivid and rich. The display's 1,344x750-pixel resolution is higher than the fifth generation's 1,136x640, but it has the same 326ppi pixel density. It's a good step up.

A grid of six-by-four apps now fits on each page plus the four in the dock below, for 28 total; on the 5's 4-inch display, it's 24. There are more pixels horizontally and vertically, unlike the merely vertical lengthening of the iPhone 5. That also means the aspect ratio is the same (16x9), and videos and Web pages scale similarly.

Native apps look fantastic and nonoptimized apps scale up well, too: games and streaming video services designed for a smaller display still fill the screen and have crisp text. I still think many people will find this 4.7-inch screen to find the right balance between functionality and portability. That noted, the iPhone 6's screen resolution is a step below ideal.

CNET

Performance: Faster still

The iPhone 6 is among the fastest phones around. It comes equipped with the A8 64-bit dual-core processor, which Apple claims delivers a 25 percent boost in speed and a 50 percent graphics boost over the iPhone 5S; this claim was confirmed in both our benchmark tests (see below) and hands-on testing. Navigating the UI and launching apps is zippy, and the phone runs nearly all tasks at a silky-smooth clip.

Apple's Metal coding tool helps some iOS games perform even better than the benchmarks suggest. Games that have been iPhone 6-optimized look great and load and run quickly, but the difference isn't as dramatic as you might expect. (Read about Apple's Metal-related announcements from its Worldwide Developers Conference in June 2015.)

The iPhone 6 features 802.11ac Wi-Fi and improved LTE antennas, which allow for faster Web browsing on both Wi-Fi and LTE.

Connecting to the Internet is fast on the iPhone 6. LTE browsing on an AT&T iPhone 6 in several locations (including San Francisco; New York City; Montclair, New Jersey; and Green Bay, Wisconsin) delivered download speeds that were slightly faster than LTE browsing on an AT&T iPhone 5S; upload speeds were a little more impressive. In Green Bay, I averaged 5.09 Mbps download and 10.6 Mbps upload speeds in the Lambeau Field parking lot for a Jets-Packers game, compared to an average of 4.3 Mbps download and 6.2 Mbps upload speeds on an iPhone 5S. From a restaurant in Clifton, New Jersey, I averaged 8.3 Mbps download and 4.6 Mbps upload on the iPhone 6, versus 8.4 Mbps download and 3.3 Mbps upload on an iPhone 5S. CNET

Call quality

The iPhone 6 supports high-quality audio via voice-over-LTE (VoLTE) and can route calls through a Wi-Fi network when a cell connection is weak. Performance varies depending on location and carrier.

In the past, Verizon iPhone users could not simultaneously use voice and data application; they now can, as long as both parties are using VoLTE-compatible phones in VoLTE-compatible coverage areas.

FaceTime calls looked better on the iPhone 6 than the 5 because of improvements Apple made to the front-facing camera. Voice calls sounded clear, though somewhat softer than calls made on the iPhone 5S.

Camera

The iPhone 6 features an 8-megapixel rear iSight camera; though it has the same megapixel count and flash as the previous model, the autofocus has been improved for both still photos and videos. Apple says its new sensor uses ""focus pixels,"" and I've found that the camera is better at avoiding out-of-focus shots. (Though the iPhone 5S captures great photos, it sometimes takes an annoyingly long time to focus.)

The iPhone 6's front and rear cameras have the same megapixel count (8 on the back, 1.2 on the front), LED ""true-tone"" flash, and sapphire lens as the 5. The still shots I took using both models looked more or less comparable.

The iPhone 6 shoots great video; the phone captured clear footage of my crazy kids, aged five and one and a half, running around in my living room.

The iPhone 6's video-recording speed can be set as low as 60fps now, which helps maintain the crispness in high-speed action. Slow-motion video recording can be set as high as 240 frames per second; this results in large files sizes but you end up with highlight clips that feel like ""Matrix"" outtakes. And the panorama mode takes clear 43-megapixel photos that allow you to zoom in for more detail.

FaceTime front-facing photos feature an f2.2 aperture, HDR sensors and a quick-burst mode (first added to the rear camera with the iPhone 5). It's noticeably better for selfies in low light and for FaceTime calls, too. The FaceTime camera is located slightly to the left of the speaker, which helps line up your face with the lens in landscape mode.

The iPhone 6 Plus features optical image stabilization for photo and video recording, where the iPhone 6 provides digital image stabilization. In practice, there's not much difference between the two.

The iPhone 6's camera is better than the iPhone 5's, especially its auto-focus performance; the 6 and 6 Plus are more or less a wash. Read our full comparison of the camera performance on the iPhone 5S, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus for a more detailed analysis.

Storage boost: Onboard and on iCloud

Apple offers a maximum of 128GB of storage for the iPhone 6. The $199 on-contract iPhone 6 ($649 off-contract) provides 16GB of space, which is OK if you don't use your phone to shoot lots of video. The 64GB model costs $299 ($749 off-contract), and the 128GB model costs $399 ($849 off-contract).

The price of Apple's iCloud storage plans, which allow for seamless online backup of mail, documents, and photos, have also fallen down to earth. The first 10GB of storage is free, and you can pay to add up to 1TB. Though there are cheaper cloud storage plans on the market, iCloud is increasingly competitive with services like Dropbox.

Health: A possible breakthrough iOS 8 app for medical records. CNET

iOS 8

Before Apple delivers iOS 9 this fall, iPhone users have access to iOS 8, which can be installed on any iPhone (model 4S and later), iPod Touch (fifth generation) and iPad (model 2 or later). The operating system is quite similar to its predecessor, iOS 7 , though with a deeper focus on extended functions: third-party keyboards, plug-ins, expanded notifications, and a new Health app that aims to knit in measurements and medical reports from other apps and sources, as well as HomeKit for smart-home connectivity (though you may need an Apple TV to serve as a hub in your home). You can find more details in our iOS 8 deep dive .

iPhone 6 versus the competition

The iPhone can't compete with all of the myriad unique and often deliberately boundary-pushing features on many Android phones. The quad HD super-high-res screen on the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 . The waterproof Sony Xperia Z3 and Samsung Galaxy S5 . From removable batteries to microSD cards to smart styli, the iPhone 6 lacks some bleeding-edge -- and even just merely useful -- features.

CNET

Still, the iPhone 6's construction quality, camera quality, overall system and graphics speed, and software-hardware integration is a formula that remains hard to beat. The iPhone is increasingly surrounded by equal-footed alternatives, but it's as good, easy-to-use and full-featured as any of them.

Except, maybe, for battery life.

CNET

Battery life

Our CNET video-loop battery test, which plays video in Airplane mode with the screen set to half brightness, ran for 10 hours and 38 minutes; an iPhone 5S running iOS 7 lasted 11 hours. I noticed the same minimal difference in my own casual use that included downloading, Web browsing, endless social-media checks, taking photos, streaming videos, and all the stuff I normally do.

So: not bad, but not great; the iPhone 6 delivers enough battery life for part of the day, not all day. ( Color me disappointed.) The iPhone 6 uses the same Lightning cables as before and requires about 2 hours to fully charge an empty battery. (Note that Apple promises longer battery life from the next version of its operating system, iOS 9 , due out in fall 2015.)

CNET

Conclusion

The iPhone 6 makes a very solid upgrade for any owner of an earlier model iPhone. It's an excellent phone overall, one of the very best you can buy, with the annoying exception of battery life, which is merely adequate. That noted, if you're looking to buy an iPhone with outstanding battery life, the iPhone 6 Plus , which also offers an elegant design, a fantastic camera and the same user-friendly OS as the 6, is certainly among our favorites.",2023-10-20 17:20:25.333240+00:00,True,False,,,,Apple iPhone 6 review: iPhone 6 sets the smartphone bar - CNET,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32679,[],2015-01-08 08:00:00+00:00,https://money.cnn.com/2015/01/08/technology/security/malvertising-huffington-post/,https://money.cnn.com,,"Published on 2015-01-08 08:00:00+00:00. This past week, The Huffington Post and several major websites displayed malware-laced advertisements that infected computers and locked them down.

The cyberattack and extortion campaign was discovered by researchers at cybersecurity firm Cyphort. The hackers are demanding money to unlock computers infected with their malware.

It's unclear how many computers were infected. The attack appears to have only affected people running Windows PCs using outdated browsers, including Internet Explorer 8 -- the most-used version of Microsoft's IE browser. Modern, updated browsers such as Internet Explorer 11, Google Chrome and Mozilla's latest version of Firefox were not susceptible to the malware.

The malware ran on ads served by AOL's network between Dec. 31 until Jan. 5, researchers said. It's possible that the campaign stretched as far back as October.

If you were using an older browser, merely visiting a website was enough to get hit with the malware. When ads appeared, they silently infected computers. People didn't even have to click on them.

It affected ads displayed on The Huffington Post, men's magazine FHM, alternative newspapers LA Weekly and Houston Press, video game site GameZone, and many others.

FHM's publisher, Bauer Media UK, said it's now asking its advertising partner, The Rubicon Project (RUBI), to investigate the matter.

None of the other websites responded to questions from CNNMoney.

AOL spokesman Gerasimos Manolatos said the company ""quickly took the necessary steps to rectify"" and said ""AOL is committed to bringing new levels of transparency to the advertising process, ensuring ads uphold quality standards and create positive consumer experiences.""

However, AOL would not say how many people were exposed to the poison ads.

The malicious software is called Kovter, a nasty strain of so-called ransomware. Once infected, the computer cuts off access to the keyboard and mouse. The screen is blocked with a message claiming to be from law enforcement. It claims you've viewed child pornography and demands a $300 ""fine"" -- suspiciously payable only via hard-to-trace, pre-paid Mastercard and Visa cards from MoneyPak.

The malware figures out your computer's location, and tailors the message accordingly. American computers get a fake message from the FBI. Those in France see one from la Police nationale. There are custom messages for Germans, Turks and U.K. residents too.

There's hope, though. Unlike its nastier cousins CryptoLocker and Cryptowall, the Kovter malware doesn't encrypt your files. It just blocks you. So you can get access back if you reboot your computer in ""safe mode,"" launch an antivirus software such as MalwareBytes, and clean your computer.

How it happened

Many websites rely on third-party advertising networks that deliver ads to your screen. It's an automated, complicated marketplace. Deals get made in milliseconds.

The sheer speed of buying and selling online ads lets criminals easily pose as legitimate customers with normal-looking ads. But those advertisements are actually laced with malware.

Malvertising, as it's called, is hard to catch. One scan isn't enough. Ads aren't static pictures anymore. Ads deliver a stream of information that's fed to them from a computer server, and that source can be changed repeatedly.

In this case, Cyport explained, AOL's alarms didn't go off because the ad redirected its source eight times -- ending up at a shady Polish website's server.

Nick Bilogorskiy, Cyphort's security research director, said this malvertisement targeted every single visitor to HuffingtonPost.com.

""These criminals really turned up the exposure and tried to compromise lots of people,"" he said. ""It's unprecedented. We've never seen it at this scale.""

Bilogorskiy's team, which scans the Internet for malware, is now reviewing records to see how far back the campaign goes.

Cyphort said it alerted AOL on Jan. 3. AOL (AOL) shut down the malvertisements two days later.

Google's software was also used to deliver the malvertisements, Cyphort said. Google (GOOG) did not respond to questions for comment.

""Malvertising is a big problem,"" Bilogorskiy said. ""We're seeing it getting worse, and we're expecting it to get really bad in 2015.""

37789,[297],2015-07-20 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/20/spacex-rocket-explosion-elon-musk-steel-strut,https://www.theguardian.com,,"Published on 2015-07-20 07:00:00+00:00. A two-foot-long steel strut only an inch wide at its thickest point was to blame for last month’s midair explosion of an unmanned SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, according to a preliminary investigation. The CEO of SpaceX, Elon Musk, said on Monday that the part, provided by an external supplier he declined to name, was “not something that should ever have failed at this force level”.

The disaster, a major setback for Musk’s ambitious space plans, also destroyed the Dragon spacecraft that the Falcon 9 was carrying. The Dragon, a partially reusable spacecraft developed by SpaceX, was due for a rendezvous at the International Space Station.

In his first public comments on the disaster, Musk said the strut “would appear to be incorrectly made but with no visible way of determining that from the outside”. The part held in place a tank of helium pressurized at about 55,000 pounds per square inch, cooled cryogenically by liquid oxygen and fed into the engine and back out again to keep the pressure equal in the rocket’s second stage.

“The strut that we believe failed was designed to handle 10,000lb of force and it failed at 2,000lb of force,” Musk said.

He also said that the Dragon could have been saved. “If the software had initiated the parachute deployment, the Dragon spacecraft would have survived,” Musk said. “We’re adding additional software so that the the spacecraft will always attempt to save itself. It’s an unfortunate thing.”



Musk said the test of SpaceX’s next version of its rocket, the Falcon Heavy, had been pushed back to the spring of 2016.

Musk cautioned that further investigation by SpaceX might reveal more over time but said that the inquiry, conducted in cooperation with the Federal Aviation Administration, Nasa and the US air force, suggested the strut had allowed the helium tank to shoot up through the stage as its buoyancy increased in proportion to the gravitational pressure of the rocket’s acceleration, ultimately releasing helium into the liquid oxygen and causing “a pressure event”.



That event took place over .893 seconds – part of the reason the findings were only preliminary. “When milliseconds matter, it’s remarkably difficult to line things up exactly right,” he said.

“It’s very difficult to test a rocket stage,” Musk said. “The only way to fully test a rocket stage would be to have an enormous centrifuge that doesn’t exist on Earth.”

The tech CEO said he believed the company had begun to rest on its laurels after several successful launches. “The company as a whole, I think, became a little bit complacent over seven years, after 20 successes in a row,” he said, “and this is an important lesson and something we’re going to take with us in the future.”

Musk said SpaceX wouldn’t be using those specific struts in the future and, when the replacements were selected, would be testing each one individually irrespective of the supplier’s certification.

Like a wedding officiant, Musk asks his employees to speak or forever hold their peace, he told reporters. “Before any flight I always send out an email saying: ‘If anyone can think of any possible reason why we should keep this flight from launching, they should call me on my cellphone or email me whether their manager agrees with it or not,’” he said. “I think sometimes it just seems like Elon being paranoid again.”



The failure, he said, wouldn’t affect the company’s submission for Nasa’s upcoming commercial cargo contract.

“Rockets are a fundamentally difficult thing,” he said.",2023-10-23 21:09:17.024543+00:00,True,True,True,True,0.814390310336866,"SpaceX rocket exploded due to faulty steel strut, Elon Musk says - The Guardian",Steel Strut Failure Led to SpaceX Falcon 9 Rocket Explosion,"The software failure incident occurred on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket during a midair explosion.

Put a computer  on a sniper rifle, and it can turn the most amateur shooter into a world-class marksman. But add a wireless connection to that computer-aided weapon, and you may find that your smart gun suddenly seems to have a mind of its own—and a very different idea of the target. Greg Kahn for WIRED At the Black Hat hacker conference in two weeks, security researchers Runa Sandvik and Michael Auger plan to present the results of a year of work hacking a pair of $13,000 TrackingPoint self-aiming rifles. The married hacker couple have developed a set of techniques that could allow an attacker to compromise the rifle via its Wi-Fi connection and exploit vulnerabilities in its software. Their tricks can change variables in the scope’s calculations that make the rifle inexplicably miss its target, permanently disable the scope’s computer, or even prevent the gun from firing. In a demonstration for WIRED (shown in the video above), the researchers were able to dial in their changes to the scope’s targeting system so precisely that they could cause a bullet to hit a bullseye of the hacker’s choosing rather than the one chosen by the shooter. “You can make it lie constantly to the user so they’ll always miss their shot,"" says Sandvik, a former developer for the anonymity software Tor. Or the attacker can just as easily lock out the user or erase the gun’s entire file system. “If the scope is bricked, you have a six to seven thousand dollar computer you can’t use on top of a rifle that you still have to aim yourself.” The exposed circuitboards of the Tracking Point TP750 that Runa Sandvik and Michael Auger hacked to control where the rounds hit. Greg Kahn for WIRED Since TrackingPoint launched in 2011, the company has sold more than a thousand of its high-end, Linux-power rifles with a self-aiming system. The scope allows you to designate a target and dial in variables like wind, temperature, and the weight of the ammunition being fired. Then, after the trigger is pulled, the computerized rifle itself chooses the exact moment to fire, activating its firing pin only when its barrel is perfectly oriented to hit the target. The result is a weapon that can allow even a gun novice to reliably hit targets from as far as a mile away. But Sandvik and Auger found that they could use a chain of vulnerabilities in the rifle’s software to take control of those self-aiming functions. The first of these has to do with the Wi-Fi, which is off by default, but can be enabled so you can do things like stream a video of your shot to a laptop or iPad. When the Wi-Fi is on, the gun’s network has a default password that allows anyone within Wi-Fi range to connect to it. From there, a hacker can treat the gun as a server and access APIs to alter key variables in its targeting application. (The hacker pair were only able to find those changeable variables by dissecting one of the two rifles they worked with, using an eMMC reader to copy data from the computer’s flash storage with wires they clipped onto its circuit board pins.) Targets show the accuracy of the Tracking Point TP750 rifle. A single shot hitting the adjacent target to the left shows what hacking the rifle can do. Greg Kahn for WIRED In the video demonstration for WIRED at a West Virginia firing range, Auger first took a shot with the unaltered rifle and, using the TrackingPoint rifle’s aiming mechanism, hit a bullseye on his first attempt. Then, with a laptop connected to the rifle via Wi-Fi, Sandvik invisibly altered the variable in the rifle’s ballistic calculations that accounted for the ammunition’s weight, changing it from around .4 ounces to a ludicrous 72 pounds. “You can set it to whatever crazy value you want and it will happily accept it,” says Sandvik. Changing a single number in the rifle’s software made the bullet fly 2.5-feet to the left, bullseyeing an entirely different target. Sandvik and Auger haven’t figured out why, but they’ve observed that higher ammunition weights aim a shot to the left, while lower or negative values aim it to the right. So on Auger's next shot, Sandvik's change of that single number in the rifle’s software made the bullet fly 2.5-feet to the left, bullseyeing an entirely different target. The only alert a shooter might have to that hack would be a sudden jump in the scope’s view as it shifts position. But that change in view is almost indistinguishable from jostling the rifle. “Depending on how good a shooter you are, you might chalk that up to ‘I bumped it,’” says Sandvik. The two hackers’ wireless control of the rifle doesn't end there. Sandvik and Auger found that through the Wi-Fi connection, an attacker could also add themselves as a “root” user on the device, taking full control of its software, making permanent changes to its targeting variables, or deleting files to render the scope inoperable. If a user has set a PIN to limit other users’ access to the gun, that root attack can nonetheless gain full access and lock out the gun’s owner with a new PIN. The attacker can even disable the firing pin, a computer controlled solenoid, to prevent the gun from firing. One thing their attack can’t do, the two researchers point out, is cause the gun to fire unexpectedly. Thankfully TrackingPoint rifles are designed not to fire unless the trigger is manually pulled. Thankfully TrackingPoint rifles are designed not to fire unless the trigger is manually pulled. In a phone call with WIRED, TrackingPoint founder John McHale said that he appreciates Sandvik and Auger’s research, and that the company will work with them to develop a software update to patch the rifle’s hackable flaws as quickly as possible. When it's ready, that update will be mailed out to customers as a USB drive, he said. But he argued that the software vulnerabilities don’t fundamentally change the gun’s safety. “The shooter’s got to pull the rifle's trigger, and the shooter is responsible for making sure it’s pointed in a safe direction. It’s my responsibility to make sure my scope is pointed where my gun is pointing,” McHale says. “The fundamentals of shooting don’t change even if the gun is hacked.” Security researcher Runa Sandvik fires a round from a Tracking Point TP750 rifle at a target 50 yards away as husband and fellow security researcher Michael Auger uses a laptop to hack into the rifle's wifi to change the trajectory of the bullet. Greg Kahn for WIRED He also pointed out that the Wi-Fi range of the hack would limit its real-world use. “It’s highly unlikely when a hunter is on a ranch in Texas, or on the plains of the Serengeti in Africa, that there’s a Wi-Fi internet connection,” he says. “The probability of someone hiding nearby in the bush in Tanzania are very low.” But Auger and Sandvik counter that with their attack, a hacker could alter the rifle in a way that would persist long after that Wi-Fi connection is broken. It’s even possible (although likely difficult), they suggest, to implant the gun with malware that would only take effect at a certain time or location based on querying a user’s connected phone. In fact, Auger and Sandvik have been attempting to contact TrackingPoint to help the company patch its rifles’ security flaws for months, emailing the company without response. The company’s silence until WIRED’s inquiry may be due to its financial problems: Over the last year, TrackingPoint has  laid off the majority of its staff, switched CEOs and even ceased to take new orders for rifles . McHale insists that the company hasn’t gone out of business, though it’s “working through an internal restructuring.” A view through the scope of the Tracking Point TP750 shows the white dot which can be set so the rifle doesn't fire until it is in the crosshairs again. Greg Kahn for WIRED Given TrackingPoint’s financial straits, Sandvik and Auger say they won’t release the full code for their exploit for fear that the company won’t have the manpower to fix its software. And with only a thousand vulnerable rifles in consumers’ hands and the hack's limited range, it may be unlikely that anyone will actually be victimized by the attack. But the rifles’ flaws signal a future where objects of all kinds are increasingly connected to the Internet and are vulnerable to hackers—including lethal weapons. “There are so many things with the Internet attached to them: cars, fridges, coffee machines, and now guns,” says Sandvik. “There's a message here for TrackingPoint and other companies...when you put technology on items that haven’t had it before, you run into security challenges you haven’t thought about before.”",2023-10-23 21:15:46.911869+00:00,True,True,True,True,0.9721610890162188,Hackers Can Disable a Sniper Rifle—Or Change Its Target - WIRED,,"The software failure incident occurred when security researchers Runa Sandvik and Michael Auger hacked a pair of $13,000 TrackingPoint self-aiming rifles.

Last year the US army confirmed it was testing smart rifles with computer-guided scopes that can aim themselves.

But now hacking researchers have revealed that they can take control of the weapons remotely, changing their target or disabling the weapon completely.

The hack is based on the smart rifle's Wi-Fi connection, and has the potential to make the weapons - which were delivered to the US army last year - vulnerable to being hijacked.

Researchers have demonstrated how their technique can wreak havoc with the gun's targeting computer, causing it to miss its target, prevent it from firing or even disable the scope completely. Pictured is a self-aiming weapon manufactured by TrackingPoint

TrackingPoint, the company that makes the smart rifles, uses cameras, sensors and Linux software to make its weapons that can turn even an inexperienced marksman into a deadly sniper.

Last year it was reported that the US army had acquired six of the weapons for testing, but the company marketed them primarily to hunters.

But researchers Runa Sandvik and Michael Auger have revealed a way to hijack the guns, and they plan to present their research at the Black Hat hacker conference in two weeks, according to Wired.

They revealed the hack to point out security flaws in the rifles, and they have been in touch with TrackingPoint to try to work on a fix to the vulnerability.

Sandvik and Auger demonstrated how their technique can wreak havoc with the gun's targeting computer, causing it to miss its target, prevent it from firing or even disable the scope completely.

Their tricks interfere with the calculations of the rifle's targeting computer so accurately that the hackers could hit a bulls-eye of their choosing - without the shooter knowing.

HOW THE RIFLE WAS HACKED The rifle scope allows users to choose a target and dial in variables including wind, temperature and weight of ammunition. But when the Wi-Fi is activated, the gun has a default password that allows anyone in the network to connect to it. Hackers can treat the rifle as a server and access its targeting application - but the researchers had to dissect one of the rifles to find its targeting variables, copying data from the on-board computer's flash storage, according to the report. They demonstrated their successful hack to Wired at a West Virginia firing range, showing how they could change the target by feeding inaccurate data to the targeting computer. However the hackers were not able to make the gun fire without the trigger itself being pulled by the shooter.

'You can make it lie constantly to the user so they'll always miss their shot,' Sandvik, a former developer for the anonymity software Tor, told Wired.

Married couple Sandvik and Auger have been working on two of the $13,000 (£8,000) TrackingPoint self-aiming rifles for the past year.

The rifles have a Wi-Fi connection so that the rifles can stream video of their shot to an iPad or computer, but which also leaves them vulnerable to the techniques developed by Sandvik and Auger.

'If the scope is bricked, you have a six to seven thousand dollar computer you can't use on top of a rifle that you still have to aim yourself,' said Sandvik.

TrackingPoint, which launched in 2011, has sold more than 1,000 of the high-end rifles, according to Wired's report.

LAS VEGAS -- Computers are showing up in everything from coffee makers to cars -- and now even guns. Texas-based TrackingPoint has been selling rifles that use computers to give even the most hopeless shooters perfect aim for years. The guns feature a scope with a wireless connection so shooters can stream videos of their shots to a laptop or mobile device.

But that wireless connection can also be exploited by a hacker to make the TrackingPoint TP750 rifle change targets or stop it from shooting all together, according to security researchers Runa Sandvik and Michael Auger.

The married duo is presenting their research, first reported on by Wired, at the Black Hat USA and DEF CON cybersecurity conferences in Las Vegas this week.

TrackingPoint has said that it is attempting to verify the researchers' conclusions. It ""will provide you with a software update if necessary,"" according to a statement posted to its Web site. Auger said the pair is working with the company on a fix.

The problem, the researchers say, is that the rifle's network comes with a default password. That could allow a nearby bad guy to gain access to the gun's targeting system and change where the gun will aim, according to the researchers. Getting the gun to miss its intended target could be as simple as changing the wind and temperature setting by using the company's own app, the researchers say.

But getting the gun to hit a different target, not just miss the shooter's mark, required more work: The researchers said they had to take the gun apart and access the system's digital storage system. In a video demonstration for Wired, the duo was able to change the gun's target -- hitting a bullseye chosen by the person on the computer instead of the one chosen by the shooter.

There are some limits to the vulnerability: First, the hacker must be in close range of the gun to take advantage of the exploit.

""You can continue to use WiFi (to download photos or connect to ShotView) if you are confident no hackers are within 100 feet,"" TrackingPoint said in its statement.

And, the researchers said, they were not able to make the gun shoot on their own. While they could alter the target, the shooter still needed to pull the trigger. Sandvik and Auger also said they found a way to load custom software onto the gun, potentially enabling them to make long-lasting changes to the gun's targeting system.

But ""TrackingPoint did take security into account when they designed this,"" said Sandvik. For instance, she said that the company tried to limit what customers could do with the rifle, including disabling its USB ports while the system boots up so hackers couldn't hijack the system during that process.

The likelihood of the vulnerability being used to harm someone in the real world is limited, Auger acknowledged, noting that the hack requires a lot of research and that the gun is not widely used.

It is also unclear whether TrackingPoint is still selling the high-tech rifle. Earlier this year, the company's Web site included a banner that said it would no longer be accepting orders due ""to financial difficulty."" Product pages currently feature a phone number for placing an order, but no one picked up when The Washington Post called.

The company also did not immediately respond to an e-mailed inquiry about the security vulnerability research by press time.

Recalls don't happen overnight. If the feds catch wind of a number of owners experiencing the same problems, they'll launch an investigation, followed by an actual recall, provided there's reason to do so. Regulators are currently in the investigation phase regarding the first-generation Toyota Sequoia and its stability control system.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is investigating improper stability-control engagement on the 2001-2002 Toyota Sequoia SUV, Reuters reports. The NHTSA claims there are 135 complaints, all of which involve the stability control kicking in at incorrect times, with individual wheels braking and the steering pulling to either the right or left.

Thus far, two crashes and five injuries are allegedly linked to this issue, which could affect some 135,000 vehicles, if it becomes a recall. Of the owners that have had the problem diagnosed, it appears to be related to a faulty sensor that could cause the system to kick in at highway speeds, which is not the time you want the vehicle pitching about, especially when it's as large as the full-size Sequoia.

Reuters also points out that the 2003 Sequoia was already recalled for low-speed stability control engagement back in 2010, following a 2008 investigation. Toyota recalled the vehicles, despite claiming that it wasn't really a safety issue.

""We are aware that the NHTSA has opened a Preliminary Evaluation concerning the 2001 and 2002 model year Sequoia,"" said Toyota spokeswoman Cindy Knight in a statement.

Toyota, the manufacturer of the Sequoia, has acknowledged the NHTSA's investigation and stated that customer safety and satisfaction are their top priorities. They have committed to cooperating with the agency during the investigation, as they have done in the past.

It is worth noting that a similar issue with low-speed stability control engagement had already led to a recall of the 2003 Sequoia in 2010, following a previous investigation in 2008.

One of Tesla's latest software updates for the Model X electric SUV claimed to improve the functionality of its trick Falcon Wing rear doors. But that ""improvement"" could have created a more serious safety issue.

Update version 7.1 2.32.100 was sent to Model X vehicles over the air to address complaints that its rear doors were opening or closing incorrectly. While one might assume that such a fix would include tweaking some software, YouTube page MEtv Product Reviews posted two videos showing that Tesla could have just deactivated the sensors that were causing the doors to act up.

If the sensors aren't working right all the time, what's the harm in disabling them, then? Well, MEtv's videos show that the doors no longer stop closing when objects are placed in their path. MEtv used produce to prove the dangers of leaving digits too close to the door, and the doors chopped straight through a cucumber. Replace that cucumber with a hand, and you can see why it might be an issue.

Tesla's official response to the issue is...disconcerting, to say the least. Tesla provided statements to both Jalopnik and Automotive News, saying that the update in question was deployed ""to improve closure consistency and reduce false detection of obstacles.""

Tesla has not yet responded to my request, which asked for a yes-or-no answer as to whether or not this update involved disabling any sensors present in the doors. It's not a question of whether or not Tesla improved door functionality. It's a question of whether or not the company did so by disabling the door sensors.

If sensors were disabled, that needs to be explained to owners, so they can (at the least) ensure that passengers keep their hands far away from the doors when closing.

Critical to the success of the 911 emergency phone system, which has saved countless lives since it was first implemented in 1968, is its ability to quickly route calls to emergency responders closest to a caller. Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter. ArrowRight But a group of researchers say they’ve found a way to effectively disable the 911 emergency system across an entire state for an extended period of time by simply launching what’s known as a TDoS attack, or telephony denial-of-service attack, against 911 call centers. The tactic involves infecting mobile phones to cause them to automatically make bogus 911 calls — without their owners' knowledge — thereby clogging call-center queues and preventing legitimate callers from reaching operators.

The researchers say it would take just 6,000 infected smartphones in a geographical area — something hackers could easily accomplish — to launch an attack sufficient to disrupt the 911 system throughout the entire state of North Carolina, and just 200,000 infected phones distributed across the U.S. to significantly disrupt 911 services around the nation.

“Under these circumstances, an attacker can cause 33 percent of the nation's legitimate callers to give up in reaching 911,” the researchers at Ben Gurion University in Israel wrote in a paper they recently passed to the Department of Homeland Security and are releasing publicly today.

Because call centers and routers around the country often operate at near capacity under normal conditions, increasing the volume of calls by just a small percentage can overwhelm them, said Mordechai Guri, head of R&D at the university's Cyber Security Center and chief scientist at Morphisec Endpoint Security. Guri conducted the work with researcher Yisroel Mirsky and Professor Yuval Elovici, head of the center.

""We believe the researchers have accurately characterized the problem"" with the 911 system, said Trey Forgety, director of government affairs for the National Emergency Number Association, who received a copy of the researchers' paper from DHS. He says his group has long been aware of the potential for a TDoS attack and brought it to the attention of DHS four years ago. ""We actually believe that the vulnerability is in fact worse than [the researchers] have calculated.""

The call capacity of 911 systems is exceptionally limited, and in many cases just three to five circuits process all 911 calls for a 911 center, Forgety said. ""Three to five circuits is trivial to overwhelm. I can do it with a pocketful of cellphones.""

The federal government considers the 911 system to be part of the nation's critical infrastructure on par with the power grid, water treatment plants and dams. Americans make more than 240 million calls annually to more than 7,000 call centers scattered across the country. About 70 percent of these calls now come from mobile phones. But the technology used to process these calls hasn't kept pace with security needs, experts say.

An attack could be prolonged for days using techniques that would prevent authorities from halting the bogus calls, Guri and his colleagues say. The problem would be exacerbated as legitimate callers trying to get through made repeated calls that further clogged the lines.

Denial-of-service attacks against 911 systems have been discussed as a concept at hacker conferences for years, although it's not known if any 911 outage has ever been caused by a TDoS attack. But in 2013, something occurred that indicated that attackers have 911 call centers in their sights. DHS and the FBI issued a warning to states about several TDoS attacks that had been launched against the administrative lines of various 911 call centers. Although these attacks didn’t target the 911 emergency lines themselves, they demonstrated the potential danger from TDoS attacks against the 911 system. The perpetrators launched the attacks as part of an extortion plot — after first demanding money and being turned down, they “launched high volume of calls against the target network, tying up the system from receiving legitimate calls,” according to the DHS alert.

How an attack works

The 911 call centers don’t run on a single, unified network; instead each state operates its own facilities, often managed at the county level, with calls being directed to centers by telecom providers or third-party companies contracted by telecoms.

When a caller dials 911, the call gets sent to a network dedicated to processing emergency calls. A router first determines the caller's location by consulting an address database if the call is coming from a landline. If it's a mobile call, the router determines the location based on coordinates sent from the mobile phone’s GPS chip or from the cellphone tower that picks up the call. Based on the caller's location, the router sends the call to the nearest Public Safety Answering Point where operators dispatch appropriate responders — fire, police, or ambulance.

To disrupt a 911 network, an attacker could infect mobile phones to create a botnet of phones — which is a network of computers or phones infected with the same malware that allows a hacker to control the devices. The attacker can infect phones either by sending malware to them as an email attachment or text message or embedding malicious code in an application that users are enticed to download and install on their phone.

How easy is it to infect a mobile phone through an app? Last year, researchers discovered malware for the iPhone operating system embedded in popular consumer apps distributed through Apple's App Store. And in 2011, a survey of Android apps distributed through Google's Play store found more than 10,000 apps contained malware or spyware of one sort or another.

Malware that the researchers created for their TDoS test infects the phone’s firmware — software beneath the operating system that makes the phone work. The attacker then sends a command to infected phones over the Internet or via covert text messages to call 911 repeatedly. Because the calls are initiated by the firmware and not the operating system, they occur silently in the background without the phone owner’s notice. No record of the calls appears in the phone’s call log either.

A carrier or 911 system could theoretically halt an attack by blacklisting phones that make repeated 911 calls, either by blocking the phones based on the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) number stored in the phone’s SIM card or the unique International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number assigned to every mobile phone during manufacturing. But the malware the researchers created causes the phones to send random IDs to cell towers instead, changing the IDs with each call the phone makes to thwart blacklisting.

Theoretically, changing the IMSI with a random one should cause a mobile phone carrier to drop the call once it recognizes that the IMSI does not belong to a legitimate subscriber. But FCC regulations require carriers to process every 911 call that comes through their cell towers, regardless of whether the call is made by a subscriber. This is because many legitimate 911 calls come from phones that are not currently on a carrier service plan. Domestic violence shelters and retirement centers, for example, often provide non-service phones to battered women so they can make emergency calls.

The Carolina test

To test their TDoS attack, the Israeli researchers built a simulated cellular network in their lab based on the 911 network in North Carolina. They chose North Carolina because the state has published extensive information about its 911 network. It has, for example, 20 routers and 188 call centers that handle more than 23,000 emergency calls daily and more than 8 million annually.

But North Carolina has a problem shared by many other states — many of its call centers rely on a single router to process 911 calls. By overwhelming one router, an attacker can affect many call centers. One North Carolina router known as the Rocky Mount SR, for example, feeds 64 call centers — more than half the state’s call centers.

The researchers found that with just 6,000 infected phones, they could prevent more than 50 percent of wireless callers in the state from reaching 911, in addition to a good percentage of landline callers.

Countermeasures and mitigation

The researchers say state authorities could resolve the problem in part by making sure they have redundancy in 911 networks so that a single router doesn’t become a major point of failure in an attack.

Federal authorities could also address the problem by telling carriers they no longer have to process calls from phones that aren't attached to a service plan. The FCC introduced a proposal last year to consider doing this, since such phones are already a problem for a different reason — many pranksters use these phones to make bogus 911 calls, since the calls can't be traced to them.

Public safety groups expressed support for the FCC proposal to eliminate the requirement, but the movement stalled this year because the FCC only plans to eliminate the requirement that carriers process such calls, not ban carriers from processing them, which would give them legal protection. Without the latter protection, Forgety says, carriers are too afraid of the liability they could face if they opt to block a legitimate call and that leads to a death or injury.

Another way to address the problem would be to alter phone hardware in a way that would prevent attackers from changing the IMSI and IMEI numbers on smartphones and replacing them with random ones. Or hardware makers could install a firewall on their devices that would detect and block repeated 911 calls that have the characteristics of botnet activity. Both of these solutions, however, would take time to implement and require the cooperation of phone manufacturers.

Whatever occurs, Guri and his colleagues say authorities need to act soon since it will only be a matter of time before attackers target 911 systems — if they haven't already.

The Good The Amazon Prime edition of Blu's R1 HD has a solid build and is super cheap. The Bad The software can be buggy, its audio volume for calls is too low and the battery takes a long time to charge. The Bottom Line The Blu R1 HD isn't a very good handset, but for $60 on Amazon Prime, it's a good enough starter phone or backup device.

That's what I wanted to know about the ad-supported Amazon Prime version of Blu's R1 HD phone, which knocks down the original retail price -- originally $110 for the 16GB model and $100 for 8GB version -- by showing you advertisements on the phone's lock screen. It'd be a tempting price for Prime members who cast a blind eye to ads with one exception: the R1 HD isn't very good. Its camera is mediocre, its performance is inconsistent, and call volume on audio speaker is too low to listen to comfortably.

Sixty dollars (or $50 for the 8GB version with ads), however, is cheap enough to justify buying the phone for a kid, or an overseas guest or maybe even as an emergency backup. You seriously can't find that low a price on any modern smartphone. But for a little more, you have better, more reliable budget options, like the Samsung Galaxy J3 ($110 to $180, depending on the carrier), the $150 Motorola Moto G4 Play (which is also splash resistant -- and there's a $100 Amazon Prime version of this, too) and the $100 ZTE ZMax Pro. So go ahead and get the R1 HD if you have a specific purpose for it, or you're looking for a throwaway phone -- just don't expect much.

Ad not-so nauseam

What do Amazon's ads look like? They appear one at a time on the lock screen and can be as small as a notification banner (which you can swipe away) or as large as the whole screen. The ads change every time you wake up the display and can range from Amazon's own Prime services to other products like Fitbit.

In general, I can't stand ads -- I even apply an ad-blocker (though never to news sites that I enjoy reading, of course, like CNET). But Amazon handles these phone ads well. They don't intrude on the interface, and I like that it's limited to just the lock screen. If you can live with the ads, you can use that $50 savings on so many other things.

No fuss design, but audio needs work

The R1 HD has a solid, pocket-friendly design that's comfortable to hold. Though its 5-inch display doesn't have the sharpest resolution at 720 pixels, text and icons are still easily readable. I'm also a sucker for display bezels that smoothly curve into the edges, and along with the device's metal trimmings it has an overall polished look.

The back cover is made of a plastic with a matte finish. It collects smudges and fingerprints, so prepare to spend time wiping those away if those are an eyesore to you. The back houses a small, circular audio speaker, too. One drawback is the handset's volume. The audio speaker is simply too low, especially for phone calls. I can barely hear the other party whenever I extend the device an arm's length away. And although hearing music and video is a bit easier, there's not enough backup volume for loud environments. The two software ""sound enhancement"" settings Blu offers to enhance volume barely make a difference.

Camera and photo quality

The handset's 8-megapixel shooter was passable, but not great. While objects were easy to make out, they also showed blurred outlines. White hues often had a subtle blue hue, and lighting was tricky to pin down too. If I wanted to avoid snapping blown-out, overexposed pictures with tap-focus, I then usually had to settle for a dim image with notable amounts of graininess. The camera had trouble focusing on anything remotely close to it too, so capturing closeup images took several tries.

Performance: Hardware and battery life

The phone can be slow and buggy at times -- my finger taps didn't register right away, apps would be slow to load, and the keyboard would sometimes display in the wrong orientation so I'd physically rotate the device in order for it to correct itself. Apps like the camera would also quit on their own without any prompting from me, which was particularly annoying.

On paper, it scored on par with other handsets in its ~$100 (non-Prime discount) price range. It beat out the Moto G4 Play on all our benchmark tests as well as the Galaxy J3 on 3D Mark's Ice Storm Unlimited (we weren't able to run the Geekbench test on the J3 after the app's update). However, the ZMax Pro noticeably edged out all comparable phones, including the R1 HD.

Battery

Our lab tests for the nonremovable 2,500mAh battery were inconsistent with what I personally observed. During our tests for continuous video playback in Airplane mode, the device lasted an average of 11 hours and 13 minutes after two trials, which is a great time.

But anecdotally, the battery drained quickly. With mild usage, it appeared to drain at a rate of about one percent per minute -- so if I were using the handset for a mere 10 minutes, it'd drop from 90 to 80 percent battery, and so on. Though this rate slowed down at about 70 percent (perhaps that is why it was able to last 11 hours during our lab tests), it's still unnerving to lose that much battery that quickly at any point during usage.

Charging the phone also took a while. From a completely drained battery, it took about 2 hours and 30 minutes to regain its reserves. Most handsets of this caliber usually take about one and a half to two hours.",2023-10-26 03:45:58.004634+00:00,True,True,False,,,Blu R1 HD review: This phone's best feature is its price - CNET,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DoubleClick, the Google-owned ad technology, has been distributing malware in an online ad served through a number of websites, according to the security researcher who says he discovered the attack. The malware infects users who visit a page where an infected banner ad is displayed. It's installed as a drive-by download, meaning that users don’t have to click on the ad to be infected, they just have to visit a website when the ad appears on the page. Wayne Huang, CTO of Armorize, says his company discovered the problem Dec. 4 and notified DoubleClick. The malicious advertisement, for gift cards, originates from a bogus advertising agency called AdShufffle, with three f’s in the name. The name appears to be playing off legitimate advertiser  AdShuffle . The malicious ad has appeared on sites for Runnersworld.com and OrganicGardening.com, among other sites that are still being determined. Runnersworld.com and OrganicGardening.com are published by the Emmaus, Pennsylvania-based Rodale Inc. A company spokeswoman said the ads have been taken down. The banner ad hawks a gift card for retail giant Target. Huang says it appears the attackers simply copied a legitimate banner ad and inserted Javascript that exploits the user's browser through one of three vulnerabilities. If the user has any of the unpatched vulnerabilities, a piece of software called ""hdd plus"" is quietly installed on their computer. The Javascript also tries to force browsers' PDF plug-ins to open a PDF to deliver the software through an Adobe exploit. Once a user is infected, the ""hdd plus"" program causes a fake Windows warning message to appear on the user's screen indicating that their machine is riddled with malware, and urging the user to purchase a security program. Huang says a backdoor is also installed on the user's machines, but he says researchers are still examining it to determine what it does. It's not known how many machines may have been infected by the malicious ad or how man web sites have displayed it. Huang says the infections appear to have begun no earlier than Dec. 4. Google acknowledged the issue in a statement to Threat Level and said it recently detected malware on its own through its DoubleClick Ad Exchange filter but this malware was stopped and never got served through its system to web sites. It's not clear if the malware Armorize found is the same malware Google detected or a different attack. ""We can confirm that the DoubleClick Ad Exchange, which has automatic malware filters, independently detected several creatives containing malware, and blocked them instantly - within seconds,"" a Google spokesman wrote in an e-mail. ""Our security team is in touch with Armorize to help investigate and help remove any affected creatives from any other ad platforms."" The malicious ads were discovered by an Armorize program called Hack Alert that scans web sites for malicious activity. Huang says that his researchers tested the malware against multiple anti-virus products and only 2 out of 42 vendors detected it. It's not the first time that DoubleClick has served up a malicious program. In 2007, a legitimate German marketer was caught serving malware through an ad. In that case, the malware caused a flood of pop-up warnings to appear on the user’s desktop telling them their machine was infected and urging them to purchase a security program.

North Korea experienced sweeping and progressively worse internet outages extending into Monday, with one computer expert saying the country’s online access at one stage went “totally down”.



The White House and the Department of State declined to say whether the US government was responsible amid tensions over the massive hacking of Sony and cancellation of The Interview, a comedy sending up regime leader Kim Jong-un.

By Tuesday, the US-based internet monitoring company Dyn said North Korea appeared to be back online. But “the question is whether it will return to the unstable fluctuations we saw before the outage”, said Dyn spokesman Jim Cowie.

Internet technology service Arbor Networks, which protects companies against hacking, said its monitoring detected denial-of-service attacks aimed at North Korea’s infrastructure starting on Saturday and persisting on Monday. Such attacks tie up a target’s internet equipment so that it becomes overwhelmed until the attacks stop or the spurious traffic can be filtered and discarded to allow normal connections to resume.

Given North Korea’s limited connectivity and lack of internet sophistication, it would be relatively simple for a band of hacktivists to shut down online access, and it should not be assumed that the US government had any part, said Dan Holden, director of security research at Arbor Networks. “Anyone of us that was upset because we couldn’t watch the movie, you could do that. Their internet is just not that sophisticated.”



Barack Obama said on Friday that the US government expected to respond to the hacking of Sony Pictures, which he described as an expensive act of “cyber vandalism” that he blamed on North Korea. The president did not say how the US might respond, and it was not immediately clear if North Korea’s internet connectivity problems were in retribution. The US government regards its offensive cyber operations as highly classified.

“We aren’t going to discuss, you know, publicly operational details about the possible response options or comment on those kind of reports in any way except to say that as we implement our responses, some will be seen, some may not be seen,” state department spokeswoman Marie Harf said.

North Korea has forcefully denied responsibility for hacking Sony.

Doug Madory, the director of internet analysis at Dyn, said the problems were discovered over the weekend and grew progressively worse until North Korea went “totally down”.

He said one benign explanation for the problem was that a router suffered a software glitch, though a cyber-attack involving North Korea’s internet service was also a possibility.

Routing instabilities were not uncommon but this particular outage was prolonged and got worse instead of better over the hours, Madory said.

“This doesn’t fit that profile,” of an ordinary routing problem, he said. “This shows something getting progressively worse over time.”

North Korea is one of the least connected countries in the world. Few North Koreans have access to computers, and even those who do are typically able to connect only to a highly regulated and censored domestic version of the internet that is not linked to the outside world.

Only a small approved segment of the population has any access to the world wide web via broadband.

North Korean diplomat Kim Song, asked on Monday about the internet problems, told the Associated Press: “I have no information.”",2023-10-28 11:02:02.507503+00:00,True,True,True,True,0.7990437201112761,North Korea's internet temporarily blacked out - The Guardian,North Korea Experiences Sweeping and Worsening Internet Outages,"The software failure occurred in North Korea, where the country experienced internet outages that started over the weekend and continued into Monday.

60988,[],2017-06-23 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/23/latest-diesel-car-models-remain-highly-polluting-tests-show,https://www.theguardian.com,,"Published on 2017-06-23 07:00:00+00:00. The latest diesel car models are failing to meet pollution limits when on the road, just three months ahead of stricter new tests, independent tests have found. Results show that none of six new 2017 diesel cars met the EU standard for toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) pollution in real-world driving.

The updated Equa Index, produced by the testing firm Emissions Analytics, shows that 86% of all diesel models put on to the British market since the 2015 Volkswagen emissions scandal failed to meet the official limit on the road, with 15% producing at least eight times more NOx emissions.

Levels of NOx, emitted mostly by diesel vehicles, have been illegally high in 90% of the UK’s urban areas since 2010. The toxic fumes are estimated to cause 23,500 early deaths a year and the problem has been called a public health emergency by a cross-party committee of MPs.

Ministers have already lost twice in the courts over the adequacy of government air quality plans and are being sued again over their latest proposals, which were published on 5 May but widely condemned as inadequate. The government’s own analysis shows clean air zones in urban centres, where charges deter the most polluting vehicles, are the most effective way to cut pollution quickly. But Nick Molden, CEO of Emissions Analytics, said the wide variation in real-world performance of diesel cars undermines such plans.

The government has indicated that any charging plans would exempt cars meeting the latest Euro 6 standard. But while some new Euro 6 diesel cars, for example the BMW 5 Series, meet the official limit when on the road, others pump out far more pollution, with the Nissan Qashqai, for example, emitting 18 times the official limit.

“These high-emitting vehicles will leave a long legacy and a dilemma for the proposed clean air zones: how can you change on the basis of Euro standards if there is such a wild divergence in performance?” Molden said.

The latest Equa Index update, which adds 20 new models to its database, shows that 70% of the diesels launched in 2016 and 2017 emit at least double the official NOx limit when on the road. That level of emissions was the standard set for Euro 4 in 2005. The most polluting of the new 2017 models tested are Land Rover Discovery, Maserati Quattroporte and Suzuki Vitara models, though all meet current legal standards.

The current official test for NOx emissions from diesel cars is laboratory-based, and carmakers have adapted their vehicles to pass this while emitting far more NOx in real-world driving. Volkswagen was caught cheating the test and other carmakers are still being investigated.

Molden said software upgrades from manufacturers would quickly and significantly cut the emissions of many existing diesel cars. But apart from VW cars, few vehicles in Europe have been recalled.

Julia Poliscanova, from the campaign group Transport & Environment, said: “Governments should require carmakers to recall and fix these dirty diesels. It would prevent tens of thousands of premature deaths every year in Europe and beyond.”

She said the latest Equa Index data showed a continuing failure by regulatory authorities: “Only three months from the new rules and almost two years after Dieselgate exposed widespread cheating on diesel emissions, regulators continue to approve vehicles that are up to 12 times more polluting than the legal limit. This demonstrates the corrupt system where the purse of carmakers rules over public health.”

From September, new diesel models will have to pass stricter, more realistic driving tests, although they will still be allowed to emit double the official limit to allow for suggested uncertainties in the measurements.

Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, which represents the UK motor industry, said: “What has been proven by official UK government emissions tests is that new cars meet legal requirements. A new, official and robust emissions test will be in place this September, with cars tested on the road for the first time, meaning industry is meeting the toughest standards in the world.

He said: “Industry is committed to improving air quality across our towns and cities, and we look forward to working with government to encourage the uptake of the latest, low-emission vehicles, regardless of fuel type.”",2023-11-25 06:24:13.207914+00:00,True,False,False,,,"Latest diesel car models remain highly polluting, tests show - The Guardian",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Google has been slammed for 'fixing' its racist image recognition algorithm by simply removing the word 'gorilla' from its auto-tag tool.

The software outraged many users back in 2015 after it tagged images of a computer programmer and his friend as primates.

Now, nearly three years later, it has been revealed the company has 'fixed' the issue by blocking identification of gorillas, chimpanzees and monkeys.

Twitter users have criticised the company for not working to develop a diverse model for an algorithm and instead just banning identification of gorillas and black people.

In 2015 Jacky Alcine, from New York, spotted photographs of him and a female friend had been labelled as gorillas by Google Photos image recognition software. Google has admitted its image labelling technology is 'nowhere near perfect' but instead of fixing it the company has simply banned the term 'gorilla'

WHAT HAPPENED? Google launched its standalone Photos app in May 2015, announcing a number of features such as automatically creating collections of people and objects like food or landscapes. However shortly after, Jacky Alcine, from Brooklyn, New York, spotted photos of him and a female friend posing for the camera had been grouped into a collection tagged 'gorilla'. In a series of Tweets to Google back in 2015, Mr Alcine said: 'Google Photos, y'all f***** up. My friend's not a gorilla. 'The only thing under this tag is my friend and I being tagged as a gorilla.

Google launched its standalone Photos app in May 2015, announcing a number of features such as automatically creating collections of people and objects like food or landscapes.

The internet giant's Google Photos application uses an auto-tagging feature to help organise images uploaded to the service and make searching easier.

However shortly after its launch, Jacky Alcine, from Brooklyn, New York, spotted photos of him and a female friend posing for the camera had been grouped into a collection tagged 'gorilla'.

The incident caused outrage and Google said that it was 'appalled' and 'genuinely sorry' for the mistake.

At the end of last year, reporters from Wired tested Google Photos using 40,000 images - many of which contained animals.

It could identify many animals such as pandas and poodles. It could also identify baboons, gibbons, orangutan and marmosets.

However, it could not identify gorillas, chimpanzees or monkeys.

A spokesperson confirmed that 'gorilla' was censored after the 2015 incident and 'chimp,' 'chimpanzee,' and 'monkey' have since been blocked too.

'Image labelling technology is still early and unfortunately it's nowhere near perfect,' the spokesperson said.

'How about making the effort to develop a diverse (eg not all white) model base for the algorithm?' tweeted Agustin Fuentes, a US-based Professor of Anthropology.

'Google has ""fixed"" its image recognition algorithm which misidentified black people as gorillas. The algorithm no longer identifies gorillas, or black people', tweeted John Overholt, a curator of Early Modern Books & Manuscripts at Harvard University.

'Google has ""fixed"" it's image recognition algorithm which misidentified black people as gorillas. The algorithm no longer identifies gorillas, or black people', tweeted John Overholt, a curator of Early Modern Books & Manuscripts at Harvard University

In a series of tweets to Google back in 2015, Mr Alcine said: 'Google Photos, y'all f***** up. My friend's not a gorilla.

'The only thing under this tag is my friend and I being tagged as a gorilla.

'What kind of sample image data you collected that would result in this son?

'And it's only photos I have with her it's doing this with.

'I understand how this happens, the problem is more so on the why. This is how you determine someone's target market.'

His tweets triggered a response from Yonatan Zunger, chief architect of social at Google, who said programmers were working on a fix to the problem.

He said: 'Thank you for telling us so quickly. Sheesh. High on my list of bugs you *never* want to see happen. Shudder.'

Jacky Alcine's tweet about the problem triggered a horrified response from Google's chief architect of social Yonatan Zunger, who said engineers were working on a variety of fixes to prevent similar issues in the future

Mr Zunger later said that Google had turned off the ability for photographs to be grouped under that label to stop the problem.

He said however the error may occur in photographs where their image recognition software failed to detect a face at all.

He said a fix for that was being worked upon.",2023-11-26 06:57:25.809948+00:00,True,True,False,,,Google bans word 'gorilla' from its 'racist' Photos app - Daily Mail,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Atlanta’s mayor on Thursday urged anyone with personal information in city information systems to check their financial records as an investigation continues into a ransomware attack on the city.

Ransomware is a malicious software that prevents or limits users from accessing their system by locking them out until a ransom is paid. NBC affiliate WXIA reported that the city received a ransom demand in bitcoin for $6,800 per unit or $51,000 to unlock the entire system. CNN has not independently confirmed the report.

Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms advised city employees to contact credit agencies and monitor their bank accounts in case their personal data was compromised. She urged the public to take the same precautions while investigators work to determine the scope of the attack.

“We don’t know the extent so we just ask that you be vigilant,” Bottoms said in a Thursday news conference. “All of us are subject to this attack, if you will. Many of us pay our bills online, we have direct deposit, so go online and check your bank statements.”

Atlanta Chief Operating Officer Richard Cox confirmed that the city received a written demand related to the attack. When asked in the news conference if the city was going to pay a ransom, Bottoms said, “We can’t speak to that right now.”

“We will be looking for guidance from, specifically, our federal partners on how to best navigate the best course of action,” she said.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Homeland Security are investigating the cyberattack, which Atlanta Information Management officials learned of Thursday at 5:40 a.m., Cox said. DHS spokesman Scott McConnell said the agency offered technical expertise and support and referred questions to the city.

The city announced outages earlier Thursday to various customer-facing applications, including those used to pay bills and access court-related information.

Thursday afternoon, Cox said several departments were affected, too. Some city data remains encrypted while investigators continue to determine the scope of the attack, he said.

The city’s payroll has not been affected, he said. Public safety and water services are operating without incident.

The city engaged Microsoft and a team from Cisco’s Incident Response Services in the investigation, Deputy Chief Information Officer Daphne Rackley said.

When asked if the city was aware of vulnerabilities and failed to take action, Rackley said the city had implemented measures in the past that might have lessened the scope of the breach. She cited a “cloud strategy” to migrate critical systems to secure infrastructure.

“This is not a new issue to the state of Georgia, it’s not a new issue to our country. We have been taking active measures to mitigate any risk in the past.”

In the meantime, the mayor urged caution.

“We don’t know if it’s limited to information related to just our employees or if it’s more extensive than that. But because we don’t know I think that it would be appropriate for the public just to be vigilant in checking their accounts and making sure your credit agencies also have been notified.”",2023-11-26 12:53:38.108064+00:00,True,True,True,True,0.7862691004855631,The FBI is investigating a ransomware attack on the city of Atlanta - CNN,Atlanta Mayor Urges Vigilance After Ransomware Attack on City Systems,"The software failure incident occurred in Atlanta on March 22, 2018.

Despite being brand new, some vehicles may still carry potential defects that could spur a recall. That's the case with Ford's latest pair of recalls, which covers some brand spankin' new models.

Recall the first: Transmission clips

Ford has issued a recall for approximately 350,000 trucks and SUVs in North America. This group includes the 2018 F-150 and 2018 Expedition equipped with 10-speed automatic transmissions, as well as 2018 F-650 and F-750 trucks equipped with six-speed automatic transmissions.

The issue stems from a single cable clip. This clip secures the shifter cable to the transmission, and it may not be fully seated on affected vehicles. If the clip becomes dislodged, the transmission may end up in a different gear than the one the driver selects. This includes shifting the vehicle to park when turning off the car -- the shifter might be in P, but the transmission could still permit movement, which is obviously a safety hazard.

Ford is aware of a single accident and injury related to this problem. Fixing the issue is as simple as checking to see if the clip was installed correctly. If it wasn't, dealers will secure the clip and adjust the shifter cable.

Recall the second: Transmission roll pins

That wasn't Ford's only recall announcement today. It also issued a much smaller recall, covering just 161 examples of the 2017-2018 Ford F-150, 2018 Expedition, 2018 Mustang and 2018 Lincoln Navigator, all of which are equipped with 10-speed automatic transmissions.

This recall also lays blame on a small transmission component, this time a roll pin that attaches the parking pawl (this holds the transmission in Park) and the transmission case. The roll pin might be missing, which with repeated use might cause the vehicle to lose Park entirely. If that happens, the vehicle won't shift to Park even when selected with the shifter. Like the first recall, that presents a safety hazard.

Remedying the issue is pretty straightforward. Dealers will look for the roll pin in question, and if one is not present, it will install one. Easy peasy.",2023-11-26 16:04:49.870723+00:00,True,True,True,True,0.7597163502896814,"Ford recalls 350000 trucks, SUVs for transmission problems - CNET",Ford Recalls Vehicles for Transmission Clip and Roll Pin Issues,"The software failure incident occurred with Ford vehicles equipped with 10-speed automatic transmissions. The first recall affected approximately 350,000 trucks and SUVs, including the 2018 F-150, 2018 Expedition, 2018 F-650, and F-750 trucks. The failure was caused by a single cable clip that secures the shifter cable to the transmission. If the clip is not fully seated, the transmission may end up in a different gear than selected by the driver, including shifting to park when turning off the car. This poses a safety hazard. Ford is aware of one accident and injury related to this issue. The responsible entity for the failure is Ford.

The second recall involved 161 examples of the 2017-2018 Ford F-150, 2018 Expedition, 2018 Mustang, and 2018 Lincoln Navigator, all equipped with 10-speed automatic transmissions. The failure was attributed to a missing roll pin that attaches the parking pawl and the transmission case. Without the roll pin, the vehicle may lose the ability to shift to park even when selected with the shifter, presenting a safety hazard. The responsible entity for this failure is also Ford.

The impact of these failures is the potential for accidents and injuries due to the transmission being in the wrong gear or not shifting to park properly. The impacted entities are the owners and drivers of the affected Ford vehicles. The solution for both recalls is for dealers to check and secure the cable clip or install a missing roll pin, respectively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For most people, a stray comma isn’t the end of the world. But in some cases, the exact placement of a punctuation mark can cost huge sums of money.

We’re bidding farewell to 2018 with some of BBC Capital’s greatest hits from over the last year. With these compelling stories, indispensable tips and expert insight, you’ll be ready to make 2019 the best it can be.

How much can a misplaced comma cost you?

If you’re texting a loved one or dashing off an email to a colleague, the cost of misplacing a piece of punctuation will be – at worst – a red face and a minor mix-up.

But for some, contentious commas can be a path to the poor house.

A dairy company in the US city of Portland, Maine settled a court case for $5m earlier this year because of a missing comma.

Three lorry drivers for Oakhurst Dairy claimed that they were owed years of unpaid overtime wages, all because of the way commas were used in legislation governing overtime payments.

The state’s laws declared that overtime wasn’t due for workers involved in “the canning, processing, preserving, freezing, drying, marketing, storing, packing for shipment or distribution of: 1) agricultural produce; 2) meat and fish products; and 3) perishable foods”.

The drivers managed to successfully argue that because there was no comma after “shipment” and before “or distribution”, they were owed overtime pay. If a comma had been there, the law would have explicitly ruled out those who distribute perishable foods.

Because there was confusion, the US Court of Appeals ruled in their favour, benefiting around 120 of the firm’s drivers. David Webbert, the lawyer who helped bring the case against the company, told reporters at the time that the inclusion of a comma in the clause “would have sunk our ship”. (He didn’t respond to interview requests from the BBC.)

The slightest misstep in punctuating a clause in a contract can have massive unintended consequences

The slip-up shows that the slightest misstep in punctuating a clause in a contract can have massive unintended consequences.

“Punctuation matters,” says Ken Adams, author of A Manual of Style for Contract Drafting. But not all punctuation is made equal: contractual minefields are not seeded with semicolons or em-dashes (here’s one: – ) waiting to explode when tripped over.

“It boils down to commas,” says Adams. “They matter, and exactly how depends on the context.”

Delivering definition

Commas in contracts link separate clauses in a non-definitive way, leaving their reading open to interpretation. While a full stop is literally that – a full and complete stop to one thought or sentence, and the signal of the start of another – commas occupy a linguistic middle ground, and one that’s often muddled. “Commas are a proxy for confusion as to what part of a sentence relates to what,” Adams explains.

Commas occupy a linguistic middle ground, and one that’s often muddled

The English language is fluid, evolving and highly subjective. Arguments have been fought over the value of so-called Oxford commas (an optional comma before the word “and” or “or” at the end of a list). There might be good arguments on either side of the debate, but this doesn’t work for the law because there needs to be a definitive answer: yes or no. In high-stakes legal agreements, how commas are deployed is crucial to their meaning. And in the case of Oakhurst Dairy against its delivery drivers, the Oxford comma is judged to have favoured the latter’s meaning.

But just because you mean to say something, it doesn’t mean that a court will agree with you, says Jeff Nobles, a Texas-based appellate lawyer who was involved in an insurance case that hinged, in part, on the punctuation of a contract.

According to Nobles, most US courts will say it doesn’t really matter what the parties subjectively intended; it’s the objective intent in the written terms of their contract. “Punctuation sometimes will change the meaning of a sentence,” he says.

Nobles represented an insurance company in a Texas Supreme Court case concerning insurance coverage for a worker who died on the job.

Nobles argued successfully that punctuation mattered for a contractual indemnity provision, when the company tried to trigger coverage under its umbrella insurance policy after a subcontracted employee died on the job. It set a precedent in the state’s legal system, he believes.

He says US courts have become increasingly textual – “they’ve looked more and more at the words on the paper rather than the testimony of the people who used those words on the paper.”

Yet arguments over commas have been raging for more than a century.

‘An expensive comma’

In 1872, an American tariff law including an unwanted comma cost taxpayers nearly $2m (the equivalent of $40m today). The United States Tariff Act, as originally drafted in 1870, allowed “fruit plants, tropical and semi-tropical for the purpose of propagation or cultivation” to be exempt from import tariffs.

For an unknown reason, when revised two years later, a stray comma sneaked in between “fruit” and “plants”. Suddenly all tropical and semi-tropical fruits could be imported without any charge.

Members of the US Congress debated the issue and the problem was fixed – but not before the New York Times bemoaned the use of “An Expensive Comma”. It wouldn’t be the last such error.

Contract language is like software code: do it right and everything works smoothly. But make a typo and the whole thing falls apart

“Contract language is limited and stylised,” says Adams. He compares it to software code: do it right and everything works smoothly. But make a typo and the whole thing falls apart.

When errors are introduced into legal documents, they’re likely to be noticed far more than in any other form of writing, he says. “People are more prone to fighting over instances of syntactic ambiguity than in other kinds of writing.”

Muddying the waters

Of course, in some circumstances, those drafting contracts may want to introduce ambiguities. Getting different countries to sign up to the same principles can be challenging, particularly for climate change agreements.

Early climate change conventions included this line:

“The Parties have a right to, and should, promote sustainable development.”

The sentence ensures those signing the agreement have the ability to promote sustainable development – and should do so.

But in its original draft, the second comma was placed after “promote”, not before it:

“The Parties have a right to, and should promote, sustainable development.”

Some countries weren’t happy with the original wording because they didn’t necessarily want to be locked into promoting sustainable development. Moving the comma kept the naysayers happy while placating those who wanted stronger action.

“By being slightly creative with punctuation, countries can feel like their interests have been addressed,” explains Stephen Cornelius, chief advisor on climate change with the WWF, who has represented the UK and EU at UN climate change negotiations. “You’re trying to get an agreement that people can substantially agree with.”

Tricks of the trade

Such linguistic flexibility happens more often than you’d think.

“In diplomacy, even though you try to have a single agreement, it’s very common to change the meaning for different parties,” says climate change negotiator Laura Hanning Scarborough. “You can use terms like ‘inter alia’, or ‘this includes, amongst other things’ to blur the lines to include anything. You can use commas as part of that, too. There are so many language tricks you use to appease people.”

For most people, however, making sure that contracts are unambiguous is important. For that reason, it’s crucial to test contract language to breaking point by giving it to someone who will test its limits – someone who will read it in the most awkward, unhelpful way, says Tiffany Kemp, a commercial contracting trainer for the International Association for Contract and Commercial Management.

One of the biggest cases battled over a comma was a dispute between two Canadian telecommunications companies. Rogers Communications and Bell Aliant fought a legal battle worth CAD$1m ($760,000) over a contract to replace utility poles across the country.

The argument stemmed from a single sentence:

“This agreement shall be effective from the date it is made and shall continue in force for a period of five (5) years from the date it is made, and thereafter for successive five (5) year terms, unless and until terminated by one year prior notice in writing by either party.”

The two sides argued that the comma after “five (5) year terms” meant something different: Bell Aliant said that the single year’s notice of termination applied at any time, Rogers that it only applied after the first five-year term ended.

This was important as Rogers had struck a great deal under their reading of the contract: when they signed a contract to lease the poles from Bell Aliant in 2002, they were paying just CAD$9.60 per pole. By 2004, the cost had nearly doubled. Bell Aliant, understandably, wanted to terminate the contract and renegotiate at the new, higher price. Rogers didn’t.

Successive courts were equally uncertain about the agreement: Canada’s Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission first declared in favour of Bell Aliant in 2006; a year later, it changed its mind after consulting the French language version of the contract, which didn’t include the same ambiguity.

This dispute wasn’t brought about by wilful ignorance, reckons Kemp. “Sometimes there are genuinely different understandings,” she explains. “That little comma was put in a place that you would put in a place for a breath if you’re reading it out loud.”

Deadly punctuation

How do these misplaced or misused commas make their way into complicated contracts that have been drafted by professionals? Part of the problem, says Adams, is technology. “Drafting contracts has long been a function of copying and pasting from precedent contracts, and that results in a kind of heedlessness, a detachment from the nitty gritty of how you’ve expressed what you want to express in a contract,” he says. “It’s easy to miss this sort of problem.”

In one extreme example, a misplaced comma was at the heart of a death-penalty trial

In one extreme example, a misplaced comma was at the heart of a death-penalty trial.

Roger Casement, an Irish nationalist, was hanged in 1916 under the 1351 Treason Act. He had incited Irish prisoners of war being held in Germany to band together to fight against the British. The debate over whether Casement was guilty hinged on the wording of the 14th Century Treason Act and the use of a comma: with it, Casement’s actions in Germany were illegal; without it, he would get away with it.

Despite Casement’s lead counsel’s assertion that “crimes should not depend on the significance of breaks or of commas”, and “if a crime depended on a comma, the matter should be determined in favour of the accused, and not of the Crown”, the court ruled that the comma mattered. Casement was found guilty and executed.

Though today life and death doesn’t hinge on the use of commas – but big money, insurance policies and environmental agreements certainly do.

For that reason, it’s important to carefully check any contracts we sign, the experts say – and that means not just dotting the Is and crossing the Ts but also making sure every comma is in the correct place.

People sign contracts not because they’ve negotiated their meanings, but based on their own understanding of what they’re agreeing to, explains Nobles. Contracts written by lawyers on behalf of a business might have a different meaning than what the lay person understands.

The first step  in solving any problem is admitting there is one. But a  new report  from the US Government Accountability Office finds that the  Department of Defense  remains in denial about cybersecurity threats to its weapons systems. Specifically, the report concludes that almost all weapons that the DOD tested between 2012 and 2017 have “mission critical” cyber vulnerabilities. “Using relatively simple tools and techniques, testers were able to take control of systems and largely operate undetected, due in part to basic issues such as poor password management and unencrypted communications,” the report states. And yet, perhaps more alarmingly, the officials who oversee those systems appeared dismissive of the results. The GAO released its report Tuesday, in response to a request from the Senate Armed Services Committee ahead of a planned $1.66 trillion in spending by the Defense Department to develop its current weapons systems. Subtitled ""DOD Just Beginning to Grapple with Scale of Vulnerabilities,"" the report finds that the department ""likely has an entire generation of systems that were designed and built without adequately considering cybersecurity."" Neither Armed Services Committee chairman James Inhofe nor ranking member Jack Reed responded to requests for comment. The GAO based its report on penetration tests the DOD itself undertook, as well as interviews with officials at various DOD offices. Its findings should be a wakeup call for the Defense Department, which the GAO describes as only now beginning to grapple with the importance of cybersecurity, and the scale of vulnerabilities in its weapons systems. “I will say that the GAO can be prone to cyber hyperbole, but unless their sampling or methodology were way off or deliberately misleading, DOD has a very grave problem on its hands,” says R. David Edelman, who served as special assistant to President Obama on cybersecurity and tech policy. “In the private sector, this is the sort of report that would put the CEO on death watch.” DOD testers found significant vulnerabilities in the department’s weapon systems, some of which began with poor basic password security or lack of encryption. As previous hacks of government systems, like the breach at the  Office of Personnel Management  or the breach of the  DOD’s unclassified email server , have taught us, poor basic security hygiene can be the downfall of otherwise complex systems. ""In the private sector, this is the sort of report that would put the CEO on death watch."" R. David Edelman, former White House cybersecurity adviser The GAO report says that one tester was able to guess an admin password on a weapons system in nine seconds. Other weapons used commercial or open source software but administers failed to change the default passwords. Yet another tester managed to partially shut down a weapons system by merely scanning it—a technique so basic, the GAO says, it “requires little knowledge or expertise.” Testers were sometimes able to take full control of these weapons. “In one case, it took a two-person test team just one hour to gain initial access to a weapon system and one day to gain full control of the system they were testing,” the report states. The DOD also had a hard time detecting when testers were probing the weapons. In one case, testers were in the weapons system for weeks, according to the GAO, but the administrators never found them. This, despite the testers being intentionally “noisy.” In other cases, the report states that automated systems did detect the testers, but that the humans responsible for monitoring those systems didn’t understand what the intrusion technology was trying to tell them. Like most unclassified reports about classified subjects, the GAO report is rich in scope but poor in specifics, mentioning various officials and systems without identifying them. The report also cautions that ""cybersecurity assessment findings are as of a specific date so vulnerabilities identified during system development may no longer exist when the system is fielded."" Even so, it paints a picture of a Defense Department playing catch-up to the realities of cyberwarfare, even in 2018. Edelman says the report reminded him of the opening scene of  Battlestar Galactica , in which a cybernetic enemy called the Cylons wipes out humanity's entire fleet of advanced fighter jets by infecting their computers. (The titular ship is spared, thanks to its outdated systems.) “A trillion dollars of hardware is worthless if you can’t get the first shot off,” Edelman says. That kind of asymmetrical cyberattack has long worried cybersecurity experts, and has been an operational doctrine of some of the United States' biggest adversaries, including, Edelman says, China, Russia, and North Korea. Yet the report underscores a troubling disconnect between how vulnerable DOD weapons systems are, and how secure DOD officials believe them to be. One tester was able to guess an admin password on a weapons system in nine seconds. “In operational testing, DOD routinely found mission-critical cyber vulnerabilities in systems that were under development, yet program officials GAO met with believed their systems were secure and discounted some test results as unrealistic,” the report reads. DOD officials noted, for instance, that testers had access that real-world hackers might not. But the GAO also interviewed NSA officials who dismissed those concerns, saying in the report that “adversaries are not subject to the types of limitations imposed on test teams, such as time constraints and limited funding—and this information and access are granted to testers to more closely simulate moderate to advanced threats.” It’s important to be clear that when the DOD dismisses these results, they are dismissing the testing from their own department. The GAO didn’t conduct any tests itself; rather, it audited the assessments of Defense Department testing teams. But arguments over what constitutes a realistic testing condition are a staple of the defense community, says Caolionn O’Connell, a military acquisition and technology expert at Rand Corporation, which has contracts with the DOD. “This is one of those religious discussions about what a realistic condition means,” O'Connell says, speaking broadly, as she hadn’t read the report before WIRED contacted her. Negotiating the terms of testing is often an arduous process between testers and acquisition specialists,  she says, because the DOD wants the tests to be hard enough to matter but not so hard that weapons can't pass. The Department of Defense could not be reached for comment by the time of writing. U.S. Government Accountability Office However, the vulnerabilities outlined in the GAO report aren’t far-fetched, nor was the DOD’s testing overly intense. Far from it. “Because test teams have a limited amount of time with a system, they look for the easiest or most effective way to gain access, according to DOD officials we met with and test reports we reviewed. They do not identify all of the vulnerabilities that an adversary could exploit,” the report states.  In addition, not all weapons have been tested. “Many program officials we met with indicated that their systems were secure, including some with programs that had not had a cybersecurity assessment,” the report states. For that reason, the GAO estimates that the vulnerabilities the DOD knows about likely comprise a small proportion of the actual risks in their systems. The tests leave out whole categories of potential problem areas, such as industrial control systems, devices that don't connect to the internet, and counterfeit parts. Though the DOD last year received accolades for actively patching bugs found through a new  bug-bounty program , the GAO report says that the department's track record for fixing vulnerabilities identified in-house is no nowhere near as good. In fact, the report found that only one out of 20 cyber vulnerabilities that the DOD had been alerted to in previous risk assessments had been fixed during the time period of the new report. “The key conclusion is that the DOD needs a new weapons security paradigm,” says Edelman. “In a world where our most sophisticated fighter jets are effectively supercomputers with very hot engines, that’s a risk we have to take very seriously.” Over a trillion dollars of advanced military weapon systems is worth nothing, if all it takes to compromise them is a default admin password.

WASHINGTON — Authorized hackers were quickly able to seize control of weapons systems being acquired by the American military in a test of the Pentagon’s digital vulnerabilities, according to a new and blistering government review. The report by the Government Accountability Office  concluded that many of the weapons, or the systems that control them, could be neutralized within hours. In many cases, the military teams developing or testing the systems were oblivious to the hacking. A public version of the study, published on Tuesday, deleted all names and descriptions of which systems were attacked so the report could be published without tipping off American adversaries about the vulnerabilities. Congress is receiving the classified version of the report, which specifies which among the $1.6 trillion in weapons systems that the Pentagon is acquiring from defense contractors were affected. But even the declassified review painted a terrifying picture of weaknesses in a range of emerging weapons, from new generations of missiles and aircraft to prototypes of new delivery systems for nuclear weapons. “In one case, the test team took control of the operators’ terminals,” the report said. “They could see, in real time, what the operators were seeing on their screens and could manipulate the system” — a technique reminiscent of what Russian  hackers did to a Ukrainian power grid  two years ago. The Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, described “red team” hackers who were pitted against cyberdefenders at the Pentagon. The tested weapons were among a total of 86 weapons systems under development; many were penetrated either through easy-to-crack passwords, or because they had few protections against “insiders” working on elements of the programs. Sometimes the testing teams toyed with their Pentagon targets. One team “reported that they caused a pop-up message to appear on users’ terminals instructing them to insert two quarters to continue operating.” The searing assessment comes after years of warnings about the vulnerabilities of the military systems — some of which the Government Accountability Office said were ignored — and just as President Trump  gives American commanders more flexibility to deploy cyberweapons  without obtaining presidential approval. It also suggests that the United States is vulnerable to cyberattacks when it seeks to disable enemy systems. The New York Times  reported last year  that former President Barack Obama had ordered accelerated cyberattacks on North Korea’s missile systems starting in 2014 — around the time, the report said, that the Pentagon belatedly began waking up to the holes in its own systems. In recent years, the Pentagon has begun to install “intrusion alarms” to warn weapons operators of signs of attacks. But the Government Accountability Office suggested that those alarms were about as effective as car alarms going off on the streets of New York: an event so common that everyone assumed it was a false alarm. “Intrusion detection systems correctly identified test team activities,” the report said. But, it added, the system “was always ‘red’” and “warnings were so common that operators were desensitized to them.” The congressional auditors called their findings the first time they have examined vulnerabilities of major weapon systems that the federal government is acquiring. That issue has become more urgent over the past decades. Older weapons used by the Pentagon, some dating to before the Vietnam War, were minimally dependent on computers or networks, making them naturally resistant to hacking. As the report made clear — and as admirals and generals have been discussing for years — the move to update systems introduces new vulnerabilities. “Today’s weapon systems are heavily computerized, which opens more attack opportunities for adversaries,” the review said. It also found that the “increasingly computerized and networked nature” of the systems was not the only problem; so was the Defense Department’s “past failure to prioritize weapon systems cybersecurity.” Compounding the problem are the millions of lines of software that are buried in parts and subsystems, creating vulnerabilities that weapons designers and contractors often do not fully grasp. “Weapon systems have a wide variety of interfaces, some of which are not obvious, that could be used as pathways for adversaries to access the systems,” the study concluded. Similar warnings have been sounded since 2013, when the government’s Defense Science Board raised the potential that sophisticated adversaries, led by Russia and China, would use cyberweapons to neutralize weapons systems even before battle. In the five years since, the Pentagon has been reluctant to discuss the subject beyond vague generalities, insisting that any public airing of the issue would only invite attacks. Included in the Government Accountability Office’s survey of vulnerabilities were submarines, missiles, cargo rockets, radars, fighter jets, refueling tankers, aircraft carriers, destroyers, satellites, helicopters and electronic jammers. In interviews, office officials said the acquisition programs under review included two of the three major classes of nuclear-weapons delivery systems: the Columbia-class submarine and the replacement for the nation’s aging Minuteman missiles, known as the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent. Not part of the $1.6 trillion total was the B-21 bomber, a new generation of stealth jet that could drop nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons themselves were not included in the report; they are mostly controlled by the Energy Department, which oversees their design and testing. But nuclear weapons have become a focus of increasing scrutiny, both inside and outside the defense establishment. Last month, the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a group that studies nuclear threats,  published a detailed report about the risks that nuclear weapons systems could be subject to cyberattacks . It warned that such attacks “could have catastrophic consequences,” including the risk that weapons could be used in response to “false warnings or miscalculation.” “The world’s most lethal weapons are vulnerable to stealthy attacks from stealthy enemies — attacks that could have catastrophic consequences,” former Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz, former Senator Sam Nunn and former Defense Minister Des Browne of Britain wrote in that report. “Today, that fact remains the chilling reality,” wrote the three Cold War veterans. “Cyberthreats are expanding and evolving at a breathtaking rate, and governments are not keeping pace. It is essential that the U.S. government and all nuclear-armed states catch up with — indeed, get ahead of and stay ahead of — this threat.”",2023-11-27 16:37:27.639905+00:00,True,True,True,True,0.8225278947277707,"New U.S. Weapons Systems Are a Hackers' Bonanza, Investigators Find (Published 2018) - The New York Times","Pentagon Weapons Systems Vulnerable to Hackers, Government Review Finds","The software failure incident occurred during a test of the Pentagon's digital vulnerabilities.

Some recalls take more than one go-around to fix. In the case of Toyota's latest recall, some of the hybrids mentioned have undergone two prior recalls to fix related issues.

Toyota has issued a recall for 2.4 million Prius and Auris hybrids worldwide. In the US, the recall covers approximately 807,000 examples of the 2010-2014 Prius and 2012-2014 Prius V . The vehicles in question, including those found in other countries, carry build dates between October 2008 and November 2014.

The issue stems from the vehicles' software. When a fault is discovered in the hybrid system, the cars in question should default to a ""failsafe"" driving mode (often referred to as ""limp"" mode) that will allow the vehicle enough power to get off the road and to a safe place. In the recalled vehicles, however, they might lose power and stall instead of going into ""limp"" mode, which could increase the risk of a crash if it happens at a bad time.

According to Toyota's release, this issue was also addressed in two prior recalls from 2014 and 2015. This new recall addresses a condition that the last two recalls ""did not anticipate.""

Thankfully, fixing the problem requires no hardware alterations. Dealership technicians will apply a software patch to the recalled vehicles, which should clean the problem up and ensure that ""limp"" mode activates when it should. Toyota will send recall notifications via first-class mail when the necessary software updates are available.",2023-11-27 17:03:32.906810+00:00,True,True,True,True,0.7672935467158926,"Toyota recalls 2.4 million Prius, Auris hybrids for software-related stalling - CNET",Toyota's Latest Recall: Software Failure Causes Power Loss and Stalling,"The software failure incident occurred in Toyota's Prius and Auris hybrids.

However, in the recalled vehicles, instead of entering ""limp"" mode, they would lose power and stall, increasing the risk of a crash.

The failure occurred in vehicles built between October 2008 and November 2014. Toyota had previously addressed this issue in two prior recalls in 2014 and 2015, but this new recall addresses a condition that was not anticipated in the previous recalls.

Dealership technicians would apply a software patch to the recalled vehicles, resolving the issue and ensuring that ""limp"" mode activates as intended.

Toyota would notify affected customers of the recall via first-class mail when the necessary software updates became available. The responsible entity for the failure and subsequent recall is Toyota.

WASHINGTON/SEATTLE (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing Co are evaluating the need for software or design changes to 737 MAX jets in the wake of last month's deadly Lion Air crash in Indonesia, the regulator said on Tuesday.

Boeing shares fell 2.1 percent on Tuesday on concerns related to the first crash of the newest version of the planemaker's best-selling jet, in which all 189 people on board were killed when it dived into the sea.

Indonesian investigators said on Monday a system designed to deal with the accident scenario was not described in the flight manual. They called for more training for 737 MAX pilots.

U.S. pilot unions later said they were not aware of the new anti-stall system.

Operating procedures and training for the 737 MAX could also change as the FAA and Boeing learn more from the investigation, the regulator said in a statement.

Investigators are preparing to publish their preliminary report on the crash on Nov. 28 or Nov. 29, one month after the Lion Air jet crashed at high speed into the Java Sea.

Until now, public attention has focused mainly on potential maintenance problems including a faulty sensor for the 'angle of attack,' a vital piece of data needed to help the aircraft fly at the right angle to the currents of air and prevent a stall.

The focus of the investigation appears to be expanding to the clarity of U.S.-approved procedures to help pilots prevent the 737 MAX from over-reacting to such a data loss, and methods for training them.

Information recovered from the jet's data recorder last week led the FAA to issue an emergency directive warning pilots that a computer on the 737 MAX could force the plane to descend sharply for up to 10 seconds even in manual flight, making it difficult for a pilot to control the aircraft.

Pilots can stop this automated response by pressing two buttons if the system behaves unexpectedly, the directive said.

But questions have been raised about how well pilots are prepared for such an automatic reaction and how much time they have to respond.

Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told Fox Business Network on Tuesday that Boeing provides ""all of the information that's needed to safely fly our airplanes"" and that the 737 MAX was a ""very safe"" airplane.

""This comes out of thousands of hours of testing and evaluating and simulating and providing the information that our pilots need to operate our airplanes safely,"" Muilenburg said.

""In certain failure modes, if there's an inaccurate angle of attack sensor feeding information to the airplane, there's a procedure to handle that,"" he added.

The FAA on Tuesday denied a report that it had launched a new probe into the safety analyses carried out by Boeing on the 737 MAX.

Boeing, the world's largest planemaker, said earlier on Tuesday it delivered 43 of its 737 aircraft last month, up from 37 a year ago, helped by a booming global market.

The number of 737 deliveries was down slightly from the 61 delivered in September due to lingering supplier problems, flagged by a Boeing executive last week.

A dissident friend of murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi believes his phone was hacked by Saudi authorities who intercepted messages critical of the country's regime.

Khashoggi, 59, had sent messages to Saudi activist Omar Abdulaziz before his death through whatsapp.

However it later emerged that the messages were compromised along with the rest of Abdulaziz's phone, which had allegedly been infected by Pegasus, a powerful piece of malware designed to spy on its users.

Abdulaziz is now suing the creators of Pegasus, the Israel-based cyber company NSO Group, accusing them of violating international law by selling the software to oppressive regimes, CNN reported.

Mr Khashoggi disappeared on October 2 when he went to the Saudi consulate in Turkey alongside fiancee Hatice Cengiz to obtain divorce papers from his previous marriage so he could remarry.

Turkey concluded that he had been killed soon after walking into the embassy and his body dismembered by a team of Saudi assassins.

The Arab kingdom initially denied the killing. Saudi then changed its story several more times before finally acknowledging that he had been killed in a act of premeditated murder.

But Saudi denied accusations by the regime's critics that Bin Salman had given the order, instead blaming 'rogue elements' of the state.

Researchers at the Citzen Lab have tracked the use of NSO Group's Pegasus software to 45 countries where operators 'may be conducting surveillance operations'.

This includes at least 10 Pegasus operators who 'appear to be actively engaged in cross-border surveillance'.

Citizen Lab researchers claim that Abdulaziz received a text message disguised as a shipping update about a package he had just ordered.

Saudi officials have admitted that Khashoggi's killing was a premeditated act carried out by state assassins, but deny that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (pictured) gave the order

The link, which Citizen Lab says it traced to a domain connected to Pegasus, led to Abdulaziz's phone becoming infected with the malware.

The software, able to infect a phone after a single click on a link in a fake text message, then grants hackers complete access to the phone, CNN reported.

Data stored on the phone, messages, phone calls and even GPS location data are visible, allowing hackers to see where someone is, who he or she is talking to, and about what.

This in turn gave hackers access to virtually his entire phone including his daily conversations with Khashoggi.

Abdulaziz believed their conversations, which were critical of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, may have been intercepted by Saudi authorities.

It is understood that Khashoggi learned that his conversations with Abdulaziz may have been intercepted and sent a text To him saying 'God help us' two months before his death on October 2.

Saudi opposition activist Omar Abdulaziz, 27, is suing the creators of Pegasus, accusing them of violating international law by selling malware to oppressive regimes

Saudi Arabia has denied accusations by the regime's critics that Bin Salman had given the order, instead blaming 'rogue elements' of the state.

The country's attorney general has sought the death penalty for five of 11 defendants charged with the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi as their high-profile trial opened in Riyadh earlier this month.

Seven of those men are bodyguards of the kingdom's de-facto ruler Mohammed bin Salman, who denies giving the order to kill him.

Mr Khashoggi's body has yet to be found amid reports that it was given to a local 'fixer' who dissolved it in acid.

A still image taken from CCTV video and obtained by A News claims to Jamal Khashoggi and his fiancee entering their residence on the day he disappeared in Istanbul

In an given by NSO Group since the company was implicated in the Khashoggi case, CEO Shalev Hulio categorically denied any involvement in the tracking of the Saudi journalist or his killing.

He told CNN that his death was a 'shocking murder' and that the company would have known immediately if their software had been used to track a journalist.

Hulio added: 'I'm saying on the record that after all these checks there was no use of any NSO product or technology on Khashoggi; and that includes tapping, monitoring, finding location, or gathering intelligence.

'Exclamation mark! The story is simply not true'.

Hulio said the NSO Group can disconnect a client's software if it is used inappropriately or against improper targets, like journalists or human rights activists who are just doing their jobs.

'In cases where the system is misused, assuming we are aware of it, the technological system that we sold them will be immediately disconnected; that is something we are able to do both technologically and legally'.",2023-11-28 06:14:17.978960+00:00,True,True,False,,,Dissident friend of murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi claims his phone was hacked - Daily Mail,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81120,[],2019-02-26 08:00:00+00:00,https://www.wired.com/story/dark-metal-cloud-computers-invisible-malware/,https://www.wired.com,,"Published on 2019-02-26 08:00:00+00:00.054000+00:00.  The security world's  paranoiacs have long cautioned that if a computer  falls into a stranger's hands , it shouldn't be trusted again. Now one company's researchers have demonstrated how, in some cases, that maxim applies just as strongly to a class of machine that never touches your hands in the first place: cloud servers. On Tuesday, researchers at the security firm Eclypsium published the results of an experiment in which they showed that they could, for a certain class of cloud computing servers, pull off an insidious trick: They can rent a server from a cloud computing provider—they focused on IBM in their testing—and alter its firmware, hiding changes to its code that live on even after they stop renting it and another customer rents the same machine. And while they made only benign changes to the IBM servers' firmware in their demonstration, they warn that the same technique could be used to plant malware in servers' hidden code that persists undetected even after someone else takes over the machine, allowing the hacker to spy on the server, alter its data, or destroy it at will. ""When organizations use public cloud infrastructure, they’re essentially borrowing equipment, like buying it used off of Ebay, and it can be pre-infected before they start using it,"" says Yuriy Bulygin, Eclypsium's founder and a former head of Intel's advanced threat research team. ""In a similar way, that equipment can be infected if the cloud service provider hasn't sanitized all its equipment at the deepest level, including the firmware."" Cloud Control That cloud sanitization problem, Eclypsium's researchers were clear to point out, doesn't effect all cloud servers. A typical cloud computing setup generates every customer's computer as a so-called virtual machine, a kind of sealed aquarium within the computer isolated from the server's actual hardware and other customers' virtual machines on the same box. But everyone from Amazon to Oracle to Rackspace also offers so-called bare metal servers, in which a customer rents and fully controls an entire computer in an attempt to improve performance or, ironically, security. IBM has thousands of enterprise customers who use bare metal machines for everything from  video conference hosting  to  mobile payments  to  neurological stimulation treatments . By renting a machine in a bare metal setup, an attacker can get far more dangerous levels of access to components that can carry malware over to that server's next renter. ""The problem is definitely worse and much easier to exploit on bare metal services,"" Bulygin says. Hackers, both in research and real-world intrusions, have for years demonstrated that the firmware in little-considered chips that control everything from  USB drives  to hard drives  can provide a hidden foothold  for malicious code. Those infections can evade all antivirus and even  survive a complete wipe  of a computer's storage. Eclypsium's researchers homed in on the firmware of a powerful component in the Super Micro servers, which IBM offers customers of its bare metal cloud computing service, known as a baseboard management controller. The BMC is used to remotely monitor and administrate the server, and it's capable of everything from accessing the computer's memory to altering its operating system. In  previous research , Eclypsium has even demonstrated that a corrupted BMC can be used to rewrite the firmware of  other  components, bricking computers or paralyzing them for a potential ransomware attack. ""Once the firmware is infected, there’s really no way to know if it is still infected or to recover from it."" Karsten Nohl, Security Research Labs In their experiments, Eclypsium's researchers would rent an IBM bare metal cloud server, then make a harmless alteration to its BMC's firmware, simply changing one bit in its code. Then they'd stop renting the server, releasing it back into IBM's pool of available machines for other customers. A few hours later, they'd rent enough servers to find the same exact machine again, identifying it by the serial number of its motherboard and other unique identifiers. They found that despite supposedly being handed a ""fresh"" machine, the BMC firmware alteration remained. ""The infection of the firmware is persistent, it’s not reimaged when you reimage the whole software stack,"" Bulygin says. And although the researchers made only a benign change, they say it would be easy enough to hide truly malicious firmware with the same trick. ""No Way to Know"" In response to Eclypsium's research, IBM posted a statement downplaying the vulnerability as ""low severity"" but promised that it now carefully wipes its servers' BMC firmware between different customers' uses: ""IBM has responded to this vulnerability by forcing all BMCs, including those that are already reporting up-to-date firmware, to be reflashed with factory firmware before they are reprovisioned to other customers,"" the statement reads. ""All logs in the BMC firmware are erased, and all passwords to the BMC firmware are regenerated."" As of Monday night, Eclypsium's researchers said they could still perform their catch-and-release trick, implying that IBM's fix wasn't in place yet. But an IBM spokesperson told WIRED that a ""fix has been implemented and we are working through the backlog."" Even so, other firmware-focused researchers are skeptical of both IBM's ""low severity"" label on the vulnerability and its supposed fix. Karsten Nohl, who developed the so-called  BadUSB attack that invisibly alters the firmware of USB sticks , pointed out that BMC firmware could be altered to both offer hackers control and to ""lie"" to administrators when they try to reflash it—essentially telling the update mechanism that it's been updated without removing the hackers' code. ""Once the firmware is infected, there’s really no way to know if it is still infected or to recover from it,"" Nohl says. Another well-known firmware hacker, H. D. Moore, argues that only adding a piece of hardware to the server to check the firmware's integrity would fully solve the problem. IBM, for its part, didn't respond to a question from WIRED about the difficulty of trusting firmware updates. And since Eclypsium tested only IBM's bare metal offerings, it's not clear if the same firmware issue applies to other companies. The good news, Nohl argues, is that the bare metal servers are only a small minority of cloud setups, and virtualized servers would be far harder to attack with the firmware trick. But that's little comfort to anyone using those vulnerable setups now. ""It's a niche. But niche or not, it doesn’t matter,"" Nohl says. ""Even for a niche, it’s a very relevant attack. And there’s no easy way to prevent it.""

Sir John Colfox Academy

The Sir John Colfox Academy has about 1,000 pupils

Hackers have used ransomware to encrypt files at a school, causing it to lose some students' GCSE coursework.

The Sir John Colfox Academy in Bridport, Dorset, said a member of staff mistakenly opened an email containing a virus.

The email claimed to be from a colleague at another Dorset school and infected the computer network.

Coursework from one subject submitted by Year 11 students, which was saved on the school' system, has been lost.

Head teacher David Herbert said: ""We are liaising with the relevant exam boards about this specific issue.""

Mr Herbert added a police expert ""has advised us that it is very unlikely that any school information has left the building and we are not compromised in that way"".

""Personal data relating to staff, students and parents is not held on this system and is secure,"" he said.

Analysis

by BBC technology reporter Jane Wakefield

Hackers are highly qualified when it comes to finding ways to infect machines and so-called ransomware has become one of the most popular ways for cyber criminals to make money.

In a typical attack, malicious software is installed on a victim's computer - typically via a link that is sent in an email - and will then proceed to encrypt all the files on it.

To get the data back, the victim will be asked to pay a ransom, often in cryptocurrency, within a certain timeframe.

Unfortunately, schools and other public institutions, such as hospitals, have become regular victims because hackers think they will be less likely to have good cyber-practices.

Falling victim can be hugely damaging to reputation - and a school which has lost GCSE coursework as a result of an attack will have some explaining to do to parents and pupils.

All of this could be simply avoided with some straightforward steps. Backing-up data on an external drive, keeping anti-virus software up to date and educating anyone who uses the network to not open unsolicited emails or click on suspicious links.

Last week school leaders were urged by the government to take action after a ""significant increase"" in cyber attacks on academy trusts were recorded.

The school in Dorset said specialists were working to try and rectify the issue, which also means Year 9 and 10 reports will be delayed by at least a week.

Technology explained: what is ransomware?

Dorset Police said: ""A full investigation is under way into the circumstances and Dorset Police's cyber crime unit is supporting and providing advice to the school.""

The force said no money had been exchanged.

Mark Orchison, managing director of technology specialists in education 9ine, said 20% of schools reported they had been a victim of cyber attacks.

'Paid hackers'

He said: ""I would say it's actually under-reported... a lot of schools don't realise they have to report each cyber attack, and some don't report them to try and reduce reputational damage.

""Many of them, when you talk about cyber security, don't know what it means; a lot don't budget for it or don't have the money to protect themselves.""

He said his team, which carried out tests on cyber security in the education sector, took an average of four hours to take over a school's IT network.",2023-11-28 17:43:40.625293+00:00,True,True,True,True,0.8293720293973326,GCSE coursework lost in cyber attack on Bridport school - BBC.com,GCSE coursework lost in cyber attack on Bridport school,"In this incident, the Sir John Colfox Academy in Bridport, Dorset experienced a software failure due to a cyber attack. The failure occurred when a member of staff mistakenly opened an email containing a virus, which claimed to be from a colleague at another Dorset school. The virus infected the school's computer network, resulting in the encryption of files through ransomware. As a result, the school lost GCSE coursework from one subject that had been submitted by Year 11 students and saved on the school's system.

The impact of the failure is significant, as the loss of GCSE coursework can have a detrimental effect on the students' academic progress. The responsible entity for the failure is the cyber attackers who deployed the ransomware. The impacted entity is the Sir John Colfox Academy, as it suffered the loss of coursework and potential damage to its reputation.

The head teacher, David Herbert, stated that the school is working with relevant exam boards to address the issue. He also mentioned that a police expert advised that no school information had left the building and that personal data of staff, students, and parents is secure as it is not held on the affected system.

The incident highlights the vulnerability of schools and public institutions to cyber attacks, as hackers often target them due to perceived weaker cybersecurity practices. The article emphasizes the importance of backing up data, keeping antivirus software up to date, and educating network users about the risks of opening unsolicited emails or clicking on suspicious links.

The school is taking steps to rectify the issue, with specialists working on resolving the problem. However, the incident has caused delays in Year 9 and 10 reports by at least a week. Dorset Police is conducting a full investigation into the circumstances, and their cyber crime unit is providing support and advice to the school. No ransom payment has been made in this case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc filed a lawsuit on Thursday against a former engineer at the company, claiming he copied the source code for its Autopilot technology before joining a Chinese self-driving car startup in January.

The engineer, Guangzhi Cao, copied more than 300,000 files related to Autopilot source code as he prepared to join China's Xiaopeng Motors Technology Company Ltd, the Silicon Valley carmaker said in the lawsuit filed in a California court.

Separately, Tesla lawyers on Wednesday filed a lawsuit against four former employees and U.S. self-driving car startup Zoox Inc, alleging the employees stole proprietary information and trade secrets for developing warehousing, logistics and inventory control operations.

In a statement, Xiaopeng spokeswoman Marie Cheung said the company was not aware of Cao's alleged misconduct and that the company has started an internal investigation on the matter.

The company ""fully respects any third-party’s intellectual property rights and confidential information. The company has been complying and will comply [with] all applicable laws and regulations,"" she said in a statement.

Cao and Zoox could not immediately be reached for comment.

Tesla is building a vehicle assembly facility in Shanghai, putting it in direct competition with Xiaopeng and other Chinese companies in the world's largest electric vehicle market.

Its Autopilot is a driver assistance system that handles some driving tasks and allows drivers to take their hands off the wheel, although the company stresses it still requires driver supervision and does not make the vehicle autonomous.

Cao's LinkedIn profile shows here he has been working with Xiaopeng since January as ""head of perception.""

Xiaopeng, which debuted an electric car in Las Vegas last year, counts Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Foxconn Technology Co Ltd among its investors.

The company, also known as Xpeng Motors, employs at least five former Tesla employees, the U.S. carmaker alleged in the lawsuit.

Apple Inc last year accused here one former employee of stealing trade secrets related to self-driving cars and joining Xiaopeng's U.S. subsidiary.

Several companies are racing to develop the technology required to make cars drive on their own and lawsuits against former employees have become common as firms strive to keep proprietary information in-house.

Alphabet Inc's Waymo self-driving vehicle unit took here Uber Technologies to court after a former employee stole thousands of confidential documents and became chief of Uber's self-driving car project. Uber later paid $245 million to settle the case.

Slow motion has  long been one of the coolest (and overused) effects in video. The technique was once exclusive to fancy, expensive cameras, but as portable device technology improves, slo-mo has become better and better. Whether you want to emphasize a cinematic moment or prolong the embarrassment of a friend you recorded in a compromising situation, slo-mo is a great tool that you should learn to wield. How It Works To get the most out of slow motion, it helps to understand the basics. Let’s start with the very concept of video itself. Video is just a series of still images (each one is a “frame”), displayed in quick enough succession that it gives the illusion of motion. Most video you see on digital devices plays at 30 frames per second. Ultimately, you want your slo-mo clips to play back at 30 fps as well so that it's the same frame rate as regular, non-slo-mo footage. However, to slow down a video and still have it look smooth without compromising the quality, you have to record at a higher frame rate, then play it back at the normal 30 fps. For example, to play back video at half speed, you would record at 60 fps or more. Boone Ashworth Many phones let you record HD video (1080p) at even higher frame rates: 240 fps slo-mo has become pretty common among premium devices, like the  Pixel 3 , the  OnePlus 7 Pro , and the  Galaxy S9 . At 240 fps, you can play the video up to eight times slower than it was recorded. At that frame rate, a four-second video could be stretched out for more than 30 seconds and still look as smooth as if it had been shot at normal speed. There are a few phones, such as the  iPhone X  and the  Galaxy S10 , that can record as high as 960 fps, but only for less than a second and at a lower resolution (720p). Note: It  is  possible to slow down a video even if it hasn’t been shot at a high frame rate, but it probably won’t look great. If you want to slow a video recorded at 30 fps to half speed, that means it’s playing back at 15 fps. It’s like trying to make a flipbook last longer by slowly thumbing through the pages—the movement looks choppy because your brain is able to distinguish between the individual images. If you want to get smooth-looking slo-mo, you really need those higher frame rates. How to Shoot Slo-Mo Most phones offer slo-mo features in their default camera apps. Just tap the settings icon on both Android and iOS phones and select the “slo-mo” or “slow motion” option, then shoot your video. To keep all this footage from getting unwieldy, it's best to record your slo-mo scenes in short bursts, about five to 10 seconds each. (Keep in mind that whatever you record is going to come out twice or even eight times as long when you convert it to slo-mo.) When you go to play it back, the app should give you the option to drag a pair of handles around the video timelines to control exactly how much of the video slows down. When you’re shooting slo-mo, keep the camera as steady as possible. Moving it even a little can cause blurriness and change of focus, which becomes much more noticeable when you slow it down. It helps to consider what you’re going for in the shot before you tap the shutter button. Think about the exact moment you want slowed down—maybe a dog shaking water out of its fur, your friend doing a sick kickflip on her skateboard—and you can capture that decisive moment. Planning really shows in the final product, so be a director and map it out. If you want a simple way to share your video, you can also adjust playback speed on social media platforms like Snapchat and Tik Tok. Slo-mo is available inside the effects settings of both apps. But if you’re eager to finesse the settings even more, that’s where dedicated slow-motion apps come into play. Do Mo’ With Slo-Mo Let’s say you want to get creative, with varied transitions between fast, normal, and slow motion—also known in the film industry as ramping. There are plenty of apps that can give you the tools to make a (hopefully less violent)  300 -style  video. With so many apps available for both Android and iOS platforms, finding a good one can seem overwhelming. Here are a few that I’ve found useful: Slow Motion Video FX (Android)  is probably the most straightforward option. It lets you control the speed of the video by dragging points up and down on a line graph. You can add additional keyframes at any point and adjust them individually, so you get fairly precise control of when the slo-mo starts and stops. Unfortunately, the app’s ads are incredibly annoying (it forces you to watch a 20-second video if you want to export in HD). If you like the app otherwise and plan to use it for more than a couple videos, it’s worth shelling out $2.49 for the full version. Adobe Premiere Clip (iOS ,  Android )  is another simple option. It makes you create an account to use it (ugh), but that allows you to connect your work in progress with other, more advanced software in Adobe Suite, should you be shelling out the monthly fee for that already. In the app, you can split clips and adjust the length of each one by percentage, which is great for controlling the exact playback speed you want. Effectum (iOS ,  Android )  is also an  OK  option. It has a variety of effects and editing options and a functional interface. The only problem is that the controls lack precision, making it a bit cumbersome if you prefer to fine-tune your videos. PowerDirector ($5, Android)  and  Filmic Pro ($15, iOS)  let you get even more elaborate with your filmmaking. While Adobe Premiere Clip and Effectum give you editing capabilities, PowerDirector and Filmic Pro let you make more precise adjustments. They definitely have a learning curve but come close to delivering the robust toolkit you'd find on desktop editing software.

Apple Pay has  a  slew of protective features  that make it a secure method of online credit card transactions. And since 2016, third-party merchants and services have been able to  embed Apple Pay into their websites  and offer it as a payment option. But at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas on Thursday, one researcher is presenting findings that this integration inadvertently introduces vulnerabilities that could expose the host website to attack. To be clear, this isn't a flaw in Apple Pay itself, or its payment network. But the findings illustrate the unintended issues that can emerge from web interconnections and third-party integrations. Joshua Maddux, a security researcher at the analysis firm PKC Security, first noticed the issue last fall when he was implementing Apple Pay support for a client. ""It’s not Apple Pay itself, it's purely an exposure to websites that have added support for Apple Pay."" Joshua Maddux, PKC Security You set up Apple Pay functionality in your web service by integrating with the Apple Pay application programming interface—allowing Apple to power the module with its existing Apple Pay infrastructure. But Maddux noticed that the connection between a site and the Apple Pay infrastructure, and the validation mechanism meant to broker this connection, can be established in a number of different ways, all at the host site's discretion. An attacker could swap the URL a target site uses to talk to Apple Pay, for instance, with a malicious URL that can send queries or commands to the target site's infrastructure. From there, the attacker can use this position to potentially extract an authorization token or other privileged data, which in turn gives them access to the website's backend infrastructure. The flaws fit into a well-known type of vulnerability called ""server side request forgery,"" which allow attackers to bypass protections like firewalls to directly send commands to web applications. These vulnerabilities pose a real threat, and are regularly exploited in the wild. Most recently, they  played a role  in  last month's massive Capital One breach . Similarly, flexibility in how a website integrates Apple Pay potentially exposes its own backend infrastructure to unauthorized access. ""It’s not Apple Pay itself, it's purely an exposure to websites that have added support for Apple Pay,"" Maddux says. ""But on the other hand, users who use Apple Pay do trust those merchant sites with their data, so in that respect the connection is important."" Maddux first notified Apple about the issue in February and communicated with the company about his proposed mitigations in March—which included locking down the options for how websites can configure the integration so there aren't so many potential exposures. Maddux says that in his evaluations it seems that Google Pay, for example, has more specific directions and fewer options. Maddux has since noticed that Apple has revised its documentation for adding an Apple Pay button to make it less likely that sites will integrate it in this potentially vulnerable way. But there don't seem to be any structural changes. Apple did not return a request for comment from WIRED. Maddux notes that server side request forgery vulnerabilities crop up in other integrations across the web as well, not just with the Apple Pay module. And it is currently possible to implement an Apple Pay button in a safer way if you know how to mitigate the potential weaknesses. But Maddux says there needs to be more awareness about the problem, because popular integrations like Apple Pay end up on countless sites across the web and create exposures even if a site's users don't directly interact with the module. ""It certainly is possible to implement support for Apple Pay safely,"" Maddux says. ""It’s just that it wouldn’t be obvious to a non-security-conscious developer who doesn't understand server side request forgery. It's currently not very deeply embedded into developers’ consciousness."" Given how many Apple Pay buttons are out there in the digital world, though, it's long past time to pay attention.

94177,[],2020-01-21 08:00:00+00:00,https://www.wired.com/story/older-sonos-speakers-will-stop-receiving-updates/,https://www.wired.com,,"Published on 2020-01-21 08:00:00+00:00.  Wireless speaker company  Sonos has long boasted about making products  built to last , despite fast-evolving technology standards that sometimes render connected devices obsolete. Now, the Santa Barbara, California-based device maker has to abandon some of its older products. Four of Sonos’ products are losing software support starting this May. These are some of the company's most aged speakers and accessories—products that were launched between 2006 and 2007. Technically, they’ve all been supported for the 10-plus-year time frame that Sonos claims its audio products will last. Sonos also says it's offering a trade-in program and recycling options for the obsolete goods. The four product lines losing software support in the spring are the original Zone Players (later sold under the names Connect and Connect: Amp); the very first Play:5 Sonos speaker; the CR200, a physical controller that preceded smartphone-app control; and the Sonos Bridge, which was used to wirelessly connect Sonos speakers together before that ability was moved into the speakers themselves. Sonos says these products have been stretched to their “technical limits” and that “over time, access to services and overall functionality will be disrupted, particularly as partners evolve their technology.” By  some accounts , products like the Bridge or the CR200 may have already been half-functional, due to  crashes  or their inability to accept the latest software updates. The CR200 remote and the original Zone Player lineup are some of the Sonos products that will stop accepting software updates. 
 Photograph: Sonos The upside is that Sonos says its legacy speakers and amps should still work on the same network alongside more modern Sonos speakers. So if you have a first-gen Play:5, for example, you should still be able to use it in conjunction with a more modern set of  Sonos One  speakers or the  Sonos Beam  soundbar. However, there's a catch. To update your entire system to the latest software, which you’ll inevitably want to do, that legacy speaker will not be able to accept the update. As long as that weak link is sitting on your network, it will prevent all of your Sonos hardware from getting the newest software, gaining new features, and receiving bug fixes. You have three options at that point: Keep running your entire Sonos network on the old software, replace the dud speaker or amp with a newer model, or isolate that obsolete speaker by setting it up on its own discrete Sonos network. Sonos says it’s offering 30 percent off any new speaker that will serve as a replacement speaker for one of the legacy products. It’s also offering to recycle the old devices at no charge—though, by the company’s calculations, it’s more sustainable if customers take their old devices to their local e-cycling centers instead of shipping them to Sonos. Native Speakers Sonos, which has been making wireless audio products for 18 years, is considered a pioneer in the streaming audio industry. The company maintains that it designs and develops products that consumers should be able to use for many years—unlike, say, the smartphone industry, which has nudged consumers into one- to two-year upgrade cycles. But it’s hard to say whether Sonos can sustain that product longevity in the future. Patrick Spence, who took over as Sonos CEO three years ago, has made it a mission to hasten the company’s product release cycle. And as the cycle has become slightly compressed, Sonos has also partnered with other technology companies (like Amazon and Google) who work within their own faster release cycles and have the ability to dictate when or how certain software features work, or potentially, stop working. A spokesperson for Sonos said that just because the company is increasing its delivery speed, that doesn't change its design approach. The rep added that it’s highly likely the next generations of Sonos speakers will continue to be supported for several years—at a minimum of five years after the product is no longer sold. Sonos has been in the news lately for reasons other than its retirement of some legacy products. Earlier this month,  The New York Times  reported that  Sonos is suing Google , one of its partners, in two federal courts, alleging that the software giant infringed on five of Sonos’ patents and that Google, in general, is squeezing smaller players like Sonos. Google has denied Sonos’ claims. Spence was also part of a  Congressional panel late last week , along with companies like Tile and the maker of PopSockets, where the smaller companies publicly testified on some of the more aggressive tactics of big tech companies like Amazon and Google.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Twitter said on Monday that it had discovered attempts by possible state actors to access the phone numbers associated with user accounts, after a security researcher unearthed a flaw in the company's ""contacts upload"" feature.

In a statement published on its privacy blog, Twitter said it had identified a ""high volume of requests"" to use the feature coming from IP addresses in Iran, Israel and Malaysia. It said, without elaborating, that ""some of these IP addresses may have ties to state-sponsored actors.""

A company spokeswoman declined to say how many user phone numbers had been exposed, saying Twitter was unable to identify all of the accounts that may have been impacted.

She said Twitter suspected a possible connection to state-backed actors because the attackers in Iran appeared to have had unrestricted access to Twitter, even though the network is banned there.

Tech publication TechCrunch reported here on Dec. 24 that a security researcher, Ibrahim Balic, had managed to match 17 million phone numbers to specific Twitter user accounts by exploiting a flaw in the contacts feature of its Android app. TechCrunch said it was able to identify a senior Israeli politician by matching a phone number through the tool.

The feature, which allows people with a user's phone number to find and connect with that user on Twitter, is off by default for users in the European Union where stringent privacy rules are in place. It is switched on by default for all other users globally, the spokeswoman said.

Twitter said in its statement that it has changed the feature so it no longer reveals specific account names in response to requests. It has also suspended any accounts believed to have been abusing the tool.

The failure was related to a flaw in the company's ""contacts upload"" feature. Twitter identified a high volume of requests to use the feature coming from IP addresses in Iran, Israel, and Malaysia, some of which may have ties to state-sponsored actors. The company was unable to determine the exact number of user phone numbers that were exposed.

The impact of the failure was that user phone numbers were potentially accessed by unauthorized individuals. The responsible entity for the failure was Twitter, as the flaw was present in their software. The impacted entities were the users whose phone numbers were associated with their Twitter accounts.

The cause of the failure was the flaw in the contacts feature of Twitter's Android app, which allowed a security researcher to match 17 million phone numbers to specific Twitter user accounts. This flaw was exploited to gain access to user phone numbers.

Twitter has taken steps to address the issue by changing the feature so it no longer reveals specific account names in response to requests. They have also suspended accounts believed to have abused the tool. However, they have not sent individual notifications to users whose phone numbers were accessed, which is considered a best practice by information security experts.

BBC

Some boats were left submerged after the sudden drop in water levels

A boat tour company says it is losing £1,000 a day because it cannot run trips on a section of river that was accidentally drained.

Water levels plunged on a stretch of the River Avon in Bath on Tuesday after a fault with a sluice gate.

Boat owners who became stranded have criticised the Environment Agency for not acting soon enough, and said the problem had happened before.

The agency said it planned to slowly raise the water levels on Friday.

It said the incident, which saw the water level drop by about 1.8m (5.9ft), was due to a fault in the software that operates a vertical sluice gate, causing it to open suddenly.

Paul Siddall's boat tour company employs eight staff and he said the loss of revenue could have an impact on the future of the business

Paul Siddall, director of River Adventures, said the malfunction had caused a ""significant financial impact"".

""It affects people who live on the river as well as those who work on it,"" he said.

He added that this year's tourist season had already been shortened due to the Covid-19 pandemic and flooding in the spring.

""We need to make the most of the season now to sustain us through the winter to next year.

""Pressure needs to be put on [the agency] to do something about this, as it has a serious impact on a lot of people who are worried about it happening again.""

The fault occurred between Weston Lock and Bath Bottom Lock on Tuesday

A security flaw in a hi-tech chastity belt for men meant the device could be locked remotely by hackers and would have forced users to cut it off with a grinder.

The flaw also made it possible for hackers to remotely lock all the global devices simultaneously.

A team of UK security professionals flagged the bug to Qiui, the Chinese developers of the app that controls the internet-linked sheath called the Cellmate Chastity Cage.

A group of UK tech researchers discovered that the Cellmate Chastity Cage (pictured) could be permanently locked by a hack, forcing anyone wearing one to be forced to remove it with brute force

The developers have now fixed the bug in the sex toy's app and have also published a manual workaround, which will be useful for anyone with the old version of the app still at risk of getting stuck.

Beforehand, with no manual override, anyone caught in such a predicament could have been forced to resort to brute force - at their own risk.

Buckingham-based cyber-security firm Pen Test Partners (PTP) have a track-record for bringing quirky cyber-flaws to light, and have highlighted problems with sex toys in the past.

The firm said that their latest discovery demonstrated that developers behind 'smart' adult products still have lessons to learn.

'The problem is that manufacturers of these other toys sometimes rush their products to market,' Alex Lomas, a researcher at the firm, told the BBC.

'Most times the problem is a disclosure of sensitive personal data, but in this case, you can get physically locked in.'

Chinese manufacturer Qiui released an update to the app, as well as a manual override for anyone who did become stuck (pictured) which involved breaking into the device

The Cellmate Chastity Cage is sold online for about $190 (£145), and is advertised as a way for its users to give their partners control over access to their bodies.

It wirelessly connects to a smartphone via a Bluetooth signal, which is used to activate the devices lock-and-clamp mechanism.

In order to do this, however, the software must send commands to a computer server used by the manufacturer.

PTP said they found a way to trick the server into disclosing the registered name of each device owner and the coordinates of the locations from where the app has been used around the world.

Furthermore, they were able to reveal the unique code given to each device.

Using the unique code, the server could be told to ignore app requests to unlock any of the devices that have been identified, potentially leaving users locked in.

The device sells online for around $190 (£145), and tech-researchers Pen Test Partners believe about 40,000 of the devices have been sold. The hack was also able to learn of the GPS locations of all devices that have been used around the world (pictured)

The research team alerted Qiui in May of the potential security risk, and while the Chinese firm updated the app and its server API, they still left an earlier version of the API online, leaving those with the older version at risk.

Qiui later told the research team that while they had tried to fix the issue, they had found it had created more problems.

Five months after first alerting the Chinese developers of the issue, PTP decided to public with their discovery.

'Given the trivial nature of finding some of these issues and that Qiui is working on another internal device, we felt compelled to publish,' Mr Lomas said.

Based on the number of IDs that have been granted by its creator, PTP believes about 40,000 of the devices have been sold.",2023-12-03 02:21:24.492517+00:00,True,True,True,True,0.7876824083192804,Hi-tech CHASTITY BELT for men could be remotely locked by hackers - Daily Mail,Security Flaw in Hi-Tech Chastity Belt Allows Remote Locking,"The software failure incident occurred with the Cellmate Chastity Cage, an internet-linked sheath for men.

Qiui

The maker of a male chastity toy that was vulnerable to a hack attack has suggested the device can be easily removed with a screwdriver.

Researchers found a flaw in Cellmate's app that could have let hackers simultaneously remotely lock all the devices in use, with no manual release.

Now the Chinese firm has defended the product, saying it can be cracked open.

It added that anybody trapped in their chastity toy could also call its customer hotline to be released.

The flaw was found by security firm Pen Test Partners, which shared its findings with Guandong-based Qiui, which makes the Cellmate toy.

Pen Test Partners

The Cellmate has been sold by several big-name online retailers as well as niche stores

As well as being able to lock devices, the researchers discovered a way to fool the server into disclosing the registered name of each device owner, among other personal details, as well as the co-ordinates of every location from where the app had been used.

The researchers shared what they had found with the company, and made their findings public when one of the underlying issues was not fixed.

Qiui has now defended its product, saying: ""Wearing a traditional chastity cage - often made of steel - with a classic padlock is much riskier.""

It said the global coronavirus pandemic had delayed its software development, but said it had submitted an updated version of its software to Apple and Google's app stores.

It rejected suggestions that users could have been trapped by the chastity device, if it had been hacked.

""Although an 'unpermitted escape' is not part of the rules of the game, the Cellmate has two emergency escape possibilities,"" said Jake Guo, chief executive of Qiui.

As well as contacting the company's hotline or social media team to trigger an override, it suggested wearers could also ""break open the Cellmate cap"" using a screwdriver.

To reveal how, the company has posted a video on its website.

""We sincerely apologise for the security flaw that was discovered in the Qiui app version 2.0 and the bad impression this made,"" Mr Guo said.

Pen Test Partners

The Cellmate has been sold via several big-name online retailers as well as niche stores

A security flaw in a hi-tech chastity belt for men made it possible for hackers to remotely lock all the devices in use simultaneously.

The internet-linked sheath has no manual override, so owners might have been faced with the prospect of having to use a grinder or bolt cutter to free themselves from its metal clamp.

The sex toy's app has been fixed by its Chinese developer after a team of UK security professionals flagged the bug.

They have also published a workaround.

This could be useful to anyone still using the old version of the app who finds themselves locked in as a result of an attacker making use of the revelation.

Any other attempt to cut through the device's plastic body poses a risk of harm.

Pen Test Partners

The workaround involves prising open the circuit board and pressing batteries against two of the wires to trigger a motor

Pen Test Partners (PTP) - the Buckingham-based cyber-security firm involved - has a reputation for bringing quirky discoveries to light, including problems with other sex toys in the past.

It says the latest discovery indicates that the makers of ""smart"" adult-themed products still have lessons to learn.

""The problem is that manufacturers of these other toys sometimes rush their products to market,"" commented Alex Lomas, a researcher at the firm.

""Most times the problem is a disclosure of sensitive personal data, but in this case, you can get physically locked in.""

Lock and clamp

Qiui's Cellmate Chastity Cage is sold online for about $190 (£145) and is marketed as a way for owners to give a partner control over access to their body.

Pen Test Partners believe about 40,000 devices have been sold based on the number of IDs that have been granted by its Guangdong-based creator.

The cage wirelessly connects to a smartphone via a Bluetooth signal, which is used to trigger the device's lock-and-clamp mechanism.

But to achieve this, the software relies on sending commands to a computer server used by the manufacturer.

The security researchers said they discovered a way to fool the server into disclosing the registered name of each device owner, among other personal details, as well as the co-ordinates of every location from where the app had been used.

In addition, they said, they could reveal a unique code that had been assigned to each device.

Pen Test Partners

A sample of the co-ordinates revealed by Cellmate's servers showed the device has been used worldwide

These could be used to make the server ignore app requests to unlock any of the identified chastity toys, they added, leaving wearers locked in.

Mr Lomas' team flagged the issue to Qiui in May, after which it updated its app as well as the server-based application programming interface (API) involved.

But it still left an earlier version of the API online, meaning those who had not downloaded the latest version of the app theoretically remained at risk.

Pen Test Partners sent follow-up emails urging this to be addressed and involved the news site Techcrunch to help press for action.

Techcrunch said Qiui's chief executive subsequently told it he had tried to tackle the issue but added: ""When we fix it, it creates more problems.""

Five months on from first getting in touch, the UK security team decided to go public.

""Given the trivial nature of finding some of these issues and that Qiui is working on another internal device, we felt compelled to publish,"" Mr Lomas said.

Pen Test Partners acknowledged that in doing so, however, it made a real-world attack more likely.

The BBC has asked Qiui to comment.

A man was left bleeding from his penis and unable to have sex for a month after he said his hi-tech internet-connected chastity belt was taken over by greedy hackers.

Sam Summers, the unfortunate owner of a Cellmate digital chastity belt, ended up paying the hackers a $1,000 ransom to free his manhood from the device, only to have the unscrupulous cyber-pirates demand even more money.

Fed up with the shakedown, Summers and his partner took matters into their own hands and employed brute force - and a sturdy pair of bolt cutters - to crack the chastity belt, leaving the man with a cut on his member.

Summers was not the only Cellmate user to have fallen victim to hackers.

A man named Sam Summers had his Cellmate brand internet-controlled chastity belt hijacked by hackers, who demanded $1,000 ransom to open it

The locking mechanism is controlled with a smartphone app via Bluetooth

Other men reported similar incidents, including one who said that he received a text message from an anonymous number that declared: 'Your c**k is mine now.'

The Cellmate, produced by Chinese firm Qiui that has the slogan 'Love Hurts,' is a cover that clamps on the base of the male genitals with a hardened steel ring, and does not have a physical key or manual override.

The locking mechanism is controlled with a smartphone app via Bluetooth -- marketed as both an anti-cheating and a submission sex play device. It retails for $169 on the company's website.

Cyber security experts first sounded the alarm about the 'smart' chastity belt's vulnerability to hackers last October, warning users that they could be left with their appendages trapped inside the device.

Summers learned all about the adult toy's security flaws the hard way.

He recounted for Vice's Motherboard how one day he was sitting at home with the chastity belt clamped tightly around his penis when he got a message from someone informing him that they had hijacked the device and demanding $1,000 in Bitcoin to release it.

'Initially, I thought it was my partner doing that,' Summers said. 'It sounds silly, but I got a bit excited by it.'

Fed up with the shakedown, Summers and his partner took matters into their own hands and employed brute force - and a sturdy pair of bolt cutters - to crack the chastity belt, leaving the man with a cut on his member

After Summer's partner assured him that she was not pulling a prank on him, the man admitted: 'I started freaking out a bit.'

After taking a closer look at the polycarbonate cage encasing his manhood, Summer quickly realized it does not feature a manual override.

'It's a chastity belt, I guess it kind of shouldn't [have an override.] But when it's a digital thing like that, it should have a key or something. But it obviously didn't,' he mused.

Summers remembered that he had some digital currency socked away in an old account and transferred the requested sum to the hackers.

But the man was not out of the woods yet: instead of unlocking the sheath, the rapacious hackers asked for more money.

'That's when I felt f***ing stupid and angry,' Summers said.

The man and his partner decided to use a tool to crack open the device, but they only had a hammer on hand. So the pair headed to a store and picked up a pair of bolt cutters.

Cellmate, produced by Chinese firm Qiui that has the slogan 'Love Hurts,' is a cover that clamps on the base of penis and does not have a physical key

First, Summers' partner tried to force open the chastity belt but couldn't do it.

Summers then tried to break the cage himself, which he said put his penis in a 'dangerous spot.' His efforts paid off, but not without some damage to his genitals.

'I don't have a scar or anything but I was bleeding and it fucking hurt,' Summers said, adding that the injury put his manhood out of commission for a month.

Qiui, the maker of the Cellmate, has posted a video on its website showing how the device can be easily removed with a screwdriver.

The harrowing ordeal prompted Summers to throw out the chastity belt, delete the app and swear off internet-connected sex toys.

'These digital things, you cannot trust them,' Summers concluded.

Coincidentally, a team of UK-based security professionals had reached the same conclusion months ago.

'We discovered that remote attackers could prevent the Bluetooth lock from being opened, permanently locking the user in the device. There is no physical unlock,' British security firm Pen Test Partners said in October.

'An angle grinder or other suitable heavy tool would be required to cut the wearer free.'

Qiui released an update to Cellmate's app, as well as a manual override for anyone who did become stuck (pictured) which involved breaking into the device

The firm also found other security flaws in the Cellmate that could expose sensitive user information such as names, phone numbers, birthdays and location data.

'It wouldn't take an attacker more than a couple of days to exfiltrate the entire user database and use it for blackmail or phishing,' PTP's Alex Lomas wrote in their report on the device.

In response to PTP's report Qiui fixed most of the issued in May by updating the software, but left the older version active and its users still vulnerable, according to the security firm.

Qiui later told the research team that while they had tried to fix the issue, they had found it had created more problems.",2023-12-03 12:52:47.278267+00:00,True,True,True,True,0.9468071879177788,"Man reveals hackers demanded $1,000 ransom to release his internet-connected chastity belt - Daily Mail",,"The software failure incident occurred when hackers took control of the Cellmate digital chastity belt, an internet-connected device designed to be controlled via a smartphone app. The incident took place at an unspecified time, but the article was published on January 28, 2021.

The cause of the failure was the vulnerability of the device to hacking, which allowed the hackers to take control of the belt and demand a $1,000 ransom from the owner, Sam Summers. Other users of the Cellmate chastity belt also reported similar incidents, including receiving threatening messages from the hackers.

CD Projekt Red co-founder Marcin Iwinski shared an apology and an explanation Wednesday for what went wrong with Cyberpunk 2077's launch last month. The game debuted with many unfixed bugs, leading to dramatic performance problems on Sony's PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox One. It also struggled on new devices like Microsoft's Xbox Series X and Sony's PlayStation 5.

""Despite good reviews on PC, the console version of Cyberpunk 2077 did not meet the quality standard we wanted it to meet,"" Iwinski said in a video shared online. ""I and the entire leadership team are deeply sorry for this, and this video is me publicly owning up to that. Please don't fault any of our teams for what happened.""

He shared in-depth explanations for what went wrong, starting with the fact that the studio wanted ""to make the game look epic on PCs"" and then adjust for consoles, especially older ones. While this strategy didn't look too difficult at first, ""I think that time has proven that we've underestimated the task,"" Iwinski said.

The primary issue, Iwinski added, is that the studio had to constantly improve its in-game streaming system for old-gen consoles. Because the game's city is so packed and old-gen consoles don't have the best disk bandwidth, the studio was ""constantly challenged."" Testing didn't show many of the issues players would later experience, he said.

""As we got closer to the final release, we saw significant improvements each and every day, and we really believed we'd deliver in the final day zero update,"" Iwinski said.

He also cited challenges brought on by COVID-19 work-from-home restrictions. ""A lot of the dynamics we normally take for granted got lost over video calls or email.""

Iwinski concluded by saying the studio's ultimate goal is to fix bugs and crashes across platforms. Patches will be rolling out regularly, with the first update coming out within 10 days, followed by ""another, more significant one in the following weeks.""

The cause of the failure was primarily attributed to the studio's approach of prioritizing the game's visuals on PCs and then adjusting for consoles, especially older ones. This strategy proved to be more challenging than anticipated, as the studio underestimated the task.

The primary issue was related to the in-game streaming system for old-gen consoles. The densely packed city in the game and the limited disk bandwidth of old-gen consoles posed constant challenges. Testing did not reveal many of the issues that players later experienced.

Meet the ColdSnap, an ice-cream-making gadget unveiled Monday by Sigma Phase at CES 2021. The ColdSnap works similarly to a Keurig appliance, but instead of dishing out coffee, it makes single-serve pod-dispensed ice cream and other tasty frozen treats. Frozen margaritas, mango passionfruit smoothies and chocolate ice cream are just a few of the available options.

While the ColdSnap is a countertop device, it clocks in at a whopping 50 pounds. That weight was a necessary ""compromise"" according to Sigma Phase President Matt Fonte, who chatted with my colleague Lexy Savvides as she tested out a ColdSnap prototype in her home. If the device were smaller and weighed less, it might take longer than the current 60-90 seconds for the machine to finish making your ice cream.

Watch this: ColdSnap makes ice cream from pods in less than 2 minutes 08:31

Fonte says his team took its inspiration from the compressor/condenser tech used in today's refrigerators and freezers to make the ColdSnap. ""We've just make it more powerful and packed it into a smaller space,"" Fonte says.

The pods look like energy drink cans. They're made of aluminum instead of plastic because they're easier to recycle, Fonte says. But each pod also has a built-in QR code and a mixer to ensure you get the right consistency for the specific pod you're making. It starts out as a liquid mix and in under two minutes, it's supposed to dispense your ice cream. Pods are designed to keep in your pantry for up to one year.

Cleanup is supposed to be simple because it dispenses straight from the pod into the bowl or cup you're using -- and the ColdSnap offers nondairy options like oat milk ice cream in addition to the standard dairy versions.

After taste-testing the chocolate ice cream pod, Lexy described the texture as ""combination of a chocolate mousse and a soft serve,"" with a good taste, although she said the machine was noisy.

I'm fascinated by this thing, but it's still very much in the prototype stage and won't be available until 2022. When it hits retail, it's expected to cost somewhere between $500 and $1,000. The pods will be somewhere in the $2.50-to-$3 range. That's a hefty price for ice cream, but it might be one worth making. We'll just have to wait and see.",2023-12-03 13:32:10.151933+00:00,True,False,,,,"ColdSnap is the Keurig of ice cream, and it's a CES 2021 product we all need right about now - CNET",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elon Musk previously stated on Twitter that he is an alien, but it seems the billionaire has had a change of opinion with a recent post that questions the existence of aliens.

'Strongest argument against aliens,' Musk tweeted, along with two charts that shows camera resolution has advanced, but UFO pictures have remained the same.

The post concludes that extraterrestrials do not exist, due to most images showing floating blobs, but many of the comments argue otherwise.

One user responded with 'that's exactly what an alien would tweet,' while another explains that most cameras 'are only capturing 400-700 nanometers' and are not capable of capturing 'true reality.'

Musk, who is the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, posted the tweet in the early hours of Tuesday.

It has since received more than 11,000 comments, 41,000 shares and 400,000 likes.

Many of his bizarre tweets typically garnish a lot of attention, but due to Musk's reputation in the space industry this one sparked a debate.

Artificial Intelligence scientist Lex Fridman was among those who disagree with the tweet, who said 'this is exactly what an alien would tweet.'

Another Twitter user explains that most cameras 'are only capturing 400-700 nanometers' and are not capable of capturing 'true reality.'

Entrepreneur Amit Paranjape added to the thousands of comments with the fact that since the birth of smartphones, random UFO sightings have dropped.

Twitter user 'Evilspot' is seems to not believe Musk's claim saying: 'He does believe aliens are real...its just kinda of upsetting that every 'ufo sightings' are like 180p or something..why are the images always look like crap!'

And another user by the name of 'Ash WSB' said 'the issue is Aliens move very fast.'

Musk has shown a flip-flopping opinion when it comes to life beyond our world.

Not only has he tweeted 'I am an alien,' but also made the claim in 2020 that the Egyptian pyramids were made by extraterrestrials.

The tweet gave credit to 'aliens' for building the pyramids in Giza near Cairo in July 2020.

'Aliens built the pyramids obv,' he wrote.

The bizarre message, however, prompted a response from Egypt's Minister of International Cooperation, Rania al-Mashat.

'I follow your work with a lot of admiration' wrote al-Mashat via Twitter.

'I invite you & Space X to explore the writings about how the pyramids were built and also to check out the tombs of the pyramid builders. Mr. Musk, we are waiting for you,' she added.

Musk seemed to take the claim back in a follow up social media post linking to an article describing how the pyramids were more likely built by humans living in an Egyptian settlement.

'This BBC article provides a sensible summary for how it was done,' Musk wrote, linking to a story with the headline, 'The Private Lives of the Pyramid-builders'.

Musk's current opinion that aliens do not exist comes just two days after the US government said it has evidence of UFOs breaking the sound barrier without a sonic boom and making maneuvers impossible with known technology, the former Director of National Intelligence has revealed.

John Ratcliffe, who served as Donald Trump's Director of National Intelligence, said that many of the incidents still have no easy explanation.

'There are a lot more sightings than have been made public,' Ratcliffe told Fox News.

'Some of those have been declassified.

'And when we talk about sightings, we are talking about objects that have seen by Navy or Air Force pilots, or have been picked up by satellite imagery that frankly engage in actions that are difficult to explain.

'Movements that are hard to replicate that we don't have the technology for. Or traveling at speeds that exceed the sound barrier without a sonic boom.'

Ratcliffe told host Maria Bartiromo that the sightings of 'unidentified aerial phenomena' had been observed all around the world.

'When we talk about sightings, the other thing I will tell you is, it's not just a pilot or just a satellite, or some intelligence collection,' Ratcliffe said.

'Usually we have multiple sensors that are picking up these things, and some of these are unexplained phenomenon, and there is actually quite a few more than have been made public.'",2023-12-03 18:18:19.404363+00:00,True,False,,,,Elon Musk shares the 'strongest argument' that aliens DON'T exist on Twitter - Daily Mail,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Biden administration is launching an emergency taskforce to address an aggressive cyber-attack that has affected hundreds of thousands of Microsoft customers around the world – the second major hacking campaign to hit the US since the election.

The attack, first reported by security researcher Brian Krebs on 5 March, allowed hackers to access the email accounts of at least 30,000 organizations in the US.

These back channels for remote access can affect credit unions, town governments and small business, and have left US officials scrambling to reach victims, with the FBI on Sunday urging them to contact the law enforcement agency.

The “unusually aggressive” attack infiltrated accounts using tools that give the attackers “total, remote control over affected systems”, cybersecurity experts briefed on the topic told Krebs.

On Saturday the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa) encouraged all organizations using Microsoft Exchange to scan devices for vulnerabilities. The breach represents “a significant vulnerability that could have far-reaching impacts”, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said in a press briefing on Friday.

“First and foremost, this is an active threat,” she said. “We are concerned that there are a large number of victims and are working with our partners to understand the scope of this.”

The latest hack comes on the heels of SolarWinds, a separate series of sophisticated attacks attributed to Russia that breached about 100 US companies and nine federal agencies.

Microsoft said it has seen “no evidence that the actor behind SolarWinds discovered or exploited any vulnerability in Microsoft products and services”.

Researchers say the recent hack began as a controlled attack on a few large targets starting in late 2020 and was detected in early January as it developed into a more widespread campaign. Additional attacks are expected from other hackers as the code used to take control of the mail servers spreads.

The Biden administration has launched a multi-agency effort initiated by the national security council, that includes the FBI, Cisa and others, the US official said, to determine who has been hacked, what has been done, and how to quickly patch the vulnerabilities.

Microsoft first issued patches for the attack on Tuesday, but fixing the issue will be more complicated as these patches do not undo the damaged already caused, said Oliver Tavakoli, the chief technology officer at California-based security firm Vectra.

“Patching their Exchange servers will prevent an attack if their Exchange server has not already been compromised,” Tavakoli said. “But it will not undo the foothold attackers have on an already compromised Exchange server.”

The European Banking Authority, the European Union’s banking regulator, which gathers and stores swaths of sensitive data about banks and their lending, confirmed on Monday it had been affected. It said it believed the cyber-attack had struck only its email servers and that no data had been obtained. Psaki declined to answer in this weekend’s press conference whether any large US government bodies were affected by the breach, and other targets have not yet been named.

A person working with the US response told Reuters that the attack had been blamed on a Chinese government-backed actor. Microsoft has also attributed the attack to China. A Chinese government spokesman said the country was not behind the intrusions, according to Reuters.

The latest hack comes on the heels of SolarWinds, a separate series of sophisticated attacks attributed to Russia that breached about 100 US companies and nine federal agencies.

“We continue to see no evidence that the actor behind SolarWinds discovered or exploited any vulnerability in Microsoft products and services,” the company said.

A Microsoft spokesman said in a statement the company is working closely with Cisa, other government agencies and security companies to respond to the hack.

“The best protection is to apply updates as soon as possible across all impacted systems. We continue to help customers by providing additional investigation and mitigation guidance,” he said. “Impacted customers should contact our support teams for additional help and resources.”

The most recent Microsoft hack, which one former national security official briefed on the matter called “absolutely massive” in an interview with Wired, may end up being larger than the historically large SolarWinds attack that prompted a congressional hearing this month.

At that hearing, tech executives including Microsoft’s president, Brad Smith, said hacks like these were difficult to address as many organizations do not publicly announce breaches until long after they are discovered.

Meanwhile, handling this hack so close to the recent SolarWinds attacks will be difficult for US agencies, said Tavakoli.

“This hack will compete for the same investigative and remediation resources, so having two such broad attacks occur near the same time places exorbitant strain on the resources,” he said.

Federal safety regulators are investigating at least 11 accidents involving Tesla cars using Autopilot or other self-driving features that crashed into emergency vehicles when coming upon the scene of an earlier crash.

The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration said seven of these accidents resulted 17 injuries and one death.

All of the Teslas in question had the self-driving Autopilot feature or the traffic-aware cruise control engaged as they approached the crashes, the NHTSA said.

Tesla (TSLA) stock fell 5% in morning trading following news of the probe.

The accidents under investigation occurred between January 22, 2018, and July 10, 2021, across nine different states. They took place mostly at night, and the post-accident scenes all included control measures like first responder vehicle lights, flares, an illuminated arrow board and road cones.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the probe.

The safety of Tesla’s Autopilot feature has been questioned before. The National Transportation Safety Board, a separate agency that also investigates plane crashes and other fatal accidents, found Autopilot partly to blame in a 2018 fatal crash in Florida that killed a Tesla driver.

Police in a Houston suburb said there was no one in the driver’s seat of a Tesla that crashed and killed two people in the car earlier this year, a charge that Tesla has denied. But Lars Moravy, Tesla’s vice president of vehicle engineering, confirmed in April in comments to investors that Tesla’s adaptive cruise control was engaged and accelerated to 30 mph before that car crashed.

Tesla has been seeking to offer full self-driving technology to its drivers. But while it says that its data shows cars using Autopilot have fewer accidents per mile than cars being driven by drivers, it does warn “current Autopilot features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous.”

The safety agency said its investigation will allow it to “better understand the causes of certain Tesla crashes,” including “the technologies and methods used to monitor, assist, and enforce the driver’s engagement with driving while Autopilot is in use.” It will also look into any contributing factors in the crashes.

“NHTSA reminds the public that no commercially available motor vehicles today are capable of driving themselves,” said the agency in a statement. “Every available vehicle requires a human driver to be in control at all times, and all state laws hold human drivers responsible for operation of their vehicles. Certain advanced driving assistance features can promote safety by helping drivers avoid crashes and mitigate the severity of crashes that occur, but as with all technologies and equipment on motor vehicles, drivers must use them correctly and responsibly.”

The investigation involves the Tesla Y, X, S and 3 with model years 2014 to 2021.

Gordon Johnson, an analyst and vocal critic of Tesla, wrote in a note to clients Monday that the issue isn’t just about Autopilot users — but also other non-Tesla drivers on the road who could be injured by cars using the feature.

“NHTSA is zeroing in on a particular danger that Tesla creates for people outside the vehicle — ie, those who never agreed to be Autopilot ‘guinea pigs,’” Johnson wrote. “Thus, to simply say ‘Tesla drivers accept Autopilot’s risks,’ as has been used in the past, does not appear to be a defense here.”

Self-driving options such as Tesla’s Autopilot or more widely available adaptive cruise control, available on a wide range of automakers’ vehicles, do a good job of slowing a vehicle down when the car in front is slowing down, said Sam Abuelsamid, an expert in self-driving vehicles and principal analyst at Guidehouse Insights.

But Abuelsamid said those vehicles are designed to ignore stationary objects when traveling at more than 40 mph so they don’t slam on the brakes when approaching overpasses or other stationary objects on the side of the road, such as a car stopped on the shoulder. Fortunately most of these vehicles with some kind of automatic braking do stop for stationary objects when they’re moving more slowly, Abuelsamid said.

The real problem he said is that many more Tesla owners assume their cars can, in fact, drive themselves than do drivers of other cars with automatic braking and other safety features. And the cues that a driver would see when approaching an accident site, such as road flares or flashing lights, make more sense to a human than they might to an auto drive system.

“When it works, which can be most of the time, it can be very good,” said Abuelsamid, about Tesla’s Autopilot feature. “But it can easily be confused by things that humans would have no problem with. Machine visions are not as adaptive as humans. And the problem is that all machine systems sometimes make silly errors.”",2023-12-04 13:53:08.615374+00:00,True,True,True,True,0.806234986716386,Tesla is under investigation because its cars keep hitting emergency vehicles - CNN,Investigation into Tesla Autopilot Crashes Involving Emergency Vehicles,"The software failure incident involved at least 11 accidents with Tesla cars using Autopilot or other self-driving features.

The cause of the failure was the failure of the Autopilot feature or the traffic-aware cruise control to properly detect and respond to the presence of emergency vehicles and control measures at the accident scenes. The impacted entity was Tesla, as the software failure occurred in their vehicles. The responsible entity for the failure is currently under investigation by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA).

Thousands of Australians have been targeted in the bizarre 'Flubot' text message scam used by fraudsters to install malicious software on their phones and steal their personal information.

The typo-strewn texts tell the recipient they have a 'missed call' and to follow a link to hear a voicemail message.

Telstra has told its customers to ignore the messages - which lure users into downloading an app which then can harvest bank details from their phone.

To avoid getting conned, cyber security experts say there are a few things you can do.

The typo-strewn Flubot texts tell the recipient they have a 'missed call' and to follow a link to hear a voicemail message.

How to get rid of Flubot If you receive the message, don't click the link or call the number. If you have there are three ways to get the malware off you phone because simply deleting it may not be enough, 1. Get and IT specialist to wipe you phone 2. Download and antivirus software program 3. Do factory reset - but be warned this will also delete all you photos, files and apps. Advertisement

Firstly, do not click on the link or call the number. Second, delete the message and block the number.

It's also a good idea to report the text to the text to the Australian Communication and Media Authority's Scamwatch.

But if you have clicked on the link, don't open any other apps or websites and immediately contact your bank and report the incident to find out if you've lost any cash.

Just deleting the app will not necessarily get the sinister malware off your phone.

Delia Rickard, deputy chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said there are three ways to get rid of the unwanted software.

You can get an IT specialist to wipe the virus, download antivirus software or do a factory reset - but be warned this will also delete all you photos, files and apps.

'I cannot think of any time I've ever seen that many complaints on one scam in such a short period of time,' Delia Rickard, deputy chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Ms Rickard told news.com.au.

'It's a very sophisticated scam and potentially very dangerous. It can compromise people's bank accounts.

One user shared a message about the scams she received from Telstra, who told her the texts were being sent at random to Australian phone numbers.

'As they're coming from legit devices across the globe they're more difficult to block than some other scams,' the message from a Telstra representative read.

'They're hard to block as they're coming from legitimate handsets and devices all over the world.

'Most popular anti-virus apps for Android will clean it up.'

Scamwatch is now receiving up to 500 Flubot reports a day, after it first appeared on August 4.

The malware which only infects Android phones has so far plucked $5579 from victims in Australia.

Hundreds of other Australians who received the texts took to Twitter to ask for help getting rid of them.

'Is anyone else getting a bunch of these messages lately?' one person wrote.

Among the typo-strewn messages she received was one that read 'you havr a zissed call. Callev lfft you a message' and 'you hate e mnssed ckll'.

'My guy's spelling is better,' another joked. 'I've had a few recently and I block each one but they keep coming.'

FluBot text messages have already been detected across Europe including in in the UK, Spain, Germany, and Poland.

The UK's National Cyber Security Centre has told users to factory reset their devices if they accidently download the malicious apps as the software cannot survive the phone's data being cleared.

Another year of masks, “Zoom” face and excessive screen time appears to have knocked the beauty industry off its axis.

In 2021, TikTok – the video platform with a track record of catapulting cosmetics to such success that they remain sold out for weeks – was awash with weird, wonderful and downright strange skin care hacks and beauty tips.

The app has proved itself a big player in the beauty industry over the past two years, influencing consumer habits by reigniting interest in products released years ago (searches for this color corrector released in 2016 are just now reaching all-time highs thanks to TikTok) and also pushing forward new trends – including a few that still have IRL beauty junkies scratching their heads.

A dizzying mix of hair hacks, slimy creatures and theatrical makeup looks, here are some of the year’s most bizarre TikTok beauty fads.

Beauty trends on the app took an often unexpected turn. Abby Roberts, Ameliaolivia09, Blinkaria

Nose blush

It became clear soon into 2021 that masks weren’t going anywhere.

Noses stayed hidden in many situations: covered in cloth while traveling on public transport and out running errands. Some more than others appeared to have missed this central facial feature: cue the meteoric rise of nose blush.

Dabbing or slathering hot pink blush onto the base of your nose was a makeup trend no one could have predicted. It first began on TikTok as part of the app’s defining E-Girl look – an internet subculture characterized by heavy eyeliner, thick brows and usually a faux heart-shaped freckle.

@abbyroberts happy easter i hope everyone had a good day hehe ♬ -

But this year, nose blush entered the mainstream – the hashtag has more than 850,000 views – as a growing number TikTokers achieved Rudolf-levels of pigment on the tips of their noses.

‘Squid Game’ makeup

A dystopian drama full of gore, sweat and masks may not seem like a natural source of beauty inspiration, but the surprise Netflix hit “Squid Game” – about a contest in which players compete in children’s games with life-or-death stakes – pulled it off.

On social media, users – including YouTubers James Charles and Raiza Contawi – created their own makeup looks inspired by the show’s fictional contestants, such as Kang Sae-Byok, the cagey North Korean refugee. The looks mimicked “Squid Game” characters’ gaunt eye bags, sweaty glow and even injuries – topped off with a smattering of faux freckles to match Sae-Byok’s.

Of course, the show’s terrifying Red Light, Green Light doll was also a popular Halloween costume choice for stars such as Lisa from Blackpink, who completed the look with drawn-on, larger-than-life eyes and pigtails.

‘Cheerful’ eyebags

Rather than the dewy, youthful glow once popular on social media, Gen Z began championing carefully constructed eye bags painted in bronzer or eyeshadow.

However, some of them chased a very specific type of eye-bag shape known as “aegyosal” in South Korea. Translating roughly to “cute fat,” aegyosal is a puffy eye bag that K-Beauty website Soko Glam says helps you “look younger and your eyes more cheerful and inviting.”

In addition to TikTok tutorials and aegyosal-specific products launched by brands such as Etude House, more long-term cosmetic procedures such as filler injections and plastic surgery treatments to achieve the look have also popped up in the United States.

On TikTok, a popular filter known as “Belle” – which superimposes aegyosal onto users’ faces – also made the rounds, creating buzz for championing an Asian beauty standard, as opposed to a Western one.

Lube as primer

It isn’t unusual for TikTokers to turn to random items in the name of a beauty hack, but lube is perhaps one of the most unexpected ones.

After TikTok user Lukáš Kohutek apparently kicked off the trend this year – beginning his beauty tutorials with a smear of Durex – others jumped on the bandwagon. The gel is applied either with a brush or using your hands all across your face, and after it dries clear, foundation and the rest of your beauty look is applied on top.

According to YouTuber Grwady, the lube helps create a “smooth, fine texture” to your skin.

Rice water hair hacks

Most people generally discard water after they’ve finished washing their rice. But some savvy social media users have taken to fermenting and bottling the milky liquid instead.

While the beauty practice has been around in Japan since ancient times, according to researchers, it became popular across the globe this year after social media influencers said washing their hair with rice water made it grow faster. Instagrammer @anisasojka claimed in one reel her locks grew “3 inches in one month.”

Snail facials

Snail mucin – the slimy, protein-packed secretion that comes from a snail’s mucus glands – has long been a popular ingredient in K-beauty for its radiance-inducing qualities.

This year, TikTok seemed to catch wind of snail mucin as a holy grail product. Corsx, a manufacturer of snail slime skin care, has their own hashtag on TikTok with 3 million views. Google searches for their product “Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence” were up 140% this year, too.

But users found a cheaper way of getting their hands on this beautifying goo: straight from the snail.

Some TikTokkers began putting snails directly onto their faces and letting them inch across the surface, before massaging the glistening trail into their skin. Many have realized their giant African snail pets can double up as an at-home beauty treatment, while others rolled up their sleeves and harvested regular garden snails.

Yassification

Perhaps the most stupefying beauty trend of 2021 had, in fact, almost nothing to do with our actual faces. The “Yassification” meme was technically born on Twitter, after someone posted two images side-by-side: a screenshot of actor Toni Collette from the 2018 horror film “Hereditary,” and the same screenshot after a few rounds of FaceApp editing.

Collette’s round mouth is still agape in terror, only now it has been plumped by scarlet red lipstick. The disconnect between context (“Hereditary” is a scary movie) and the altered subject (Collette looks like a digitally dolled-up influencer) was what caused the original meme to spread like wildfire.

Now, yassification has migrated to TikTok, where users mock the clever editing software that leaves their faces unrecognizable through layers of AI-generated airbrushing, lip-lining and hair thickening.",2023-12-05 04:52:10.781446+00:00,True,False,,,,2021’s weirdest TikTok beauty trends - CNN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Robert Davies' crimes were described as ""despicable"" by the judge

A software engineer who remotely accessed his victims' files, photos and webcams has been sent to jail.

Robert Davies hacked into a schoolgirl's webcam and secretly filmed her showering and undressing.

The 32-year-old targeted 25 people in total, including some he knew, stealing chat histories and in some cases intimate photos and videos.

At Nottingham Crown Court, he was sentenced to two years and two months in prison.

The court heard how between 2010 and 2019 Davies used malware to gain remote control of people's devices and access their data without their knowledge.

The prosecution said in some cases he also created Skype accounts to ""catfish"" his victims, setting up fake online profiles to trick them into performing sex acts for him.

With one of his personas, he befriended an 11-year-old girl and over the course of about two years built a relationship with her.

He gained access to her computer and was able to switch on her webcam without her knowing.

'Devastating impact'

Judge Julie Warburton told the court his victims had been left feeling ""violated"".

She added: ""This was a campaign of offending of a serious nature with devastating impact on 25 individuals who you exploited over a period of 10 years.

""The extent of the damage you have caused is immeasurable and constitutes a total violation of their privacy.""

Davies, of Byron Close in Nottingham, had earlier pleaded guilty to 25 counts of causing a computer belonging to another to perform a function with intent to secure unauthorised access.

He also admitted one count of voyeurism, four counts of making indecent photos of children and one count of possession of extreme pornographic material.

Following his sentencing, Andrew Shorrock from the National Crime Agency (NCA) said: ""Davies had amassed what can only be described as a cyber criminal's toolkit.

""Not only was he using these tools to break in to peoples' devices, he was using them to spy on his unsuspecting victims and to steal naked images of them for his own sexual gratification.""",2023-12-05 08:26:12.446179+00:00,True,True,False,,,Nottingham man who used girl's webcam to spy on her jailed - BBC.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Engineering work delayed the cleaning of rails in Salisbury last October, less than two hours before a passenger train skidded on leaves stuck to the line and crashed, injuring 14, investigators have found.

The routine autumn cleaning work had been rescheduled from 5pm to 11pm the same evening but at 6.43pm a South Western Railway train was unable to stop on the slippery tracks and collided with a Great Western Railway service outside a tunnel near Salisbury, Wiltshire.

The collision was the worst between two moving passenger trains in the UK in 20 years, and left 13 passengers hurt and the South Western train driver with life-changing injuries.

The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) found the planned deployment of a rail head treatment train (RHHT) to tackle leaves on the line was delayed because of nearby engineering work. The track had been cleaned by a RHTT about 32 hours earlier.

Network Rail’s RHTTs use water jets or a sand-based gel to clean off the leaves, which can compress to form a slippery film on the rails and pose a danger to trains.

Accident inspectors found many areas around the crash site “had a medium or heavy level of contamination”, with black deposits on rails formed by crushed leaves, which were also wet from rain on the day of the crash. Strong winds and heavy rain were also likely factors, they found.

In an interim report, the RAIB said that the South Western train was travelling at 86mph, within the speed limit, as it approached a stop signal near the tunnel but when the driver tried to brake, its wheels began to slide almost immediately. It slid for almost 200 metres before hitting the side of the other train at a junction.

Inspectors said there was no problem with the signalling system, which was “operating as designed”.

As well as the injuries to the 14 people on board, the crash caused major damage to the trains and the railway infrastructure. Services in the area were disrupted for two weeks while repairs were carried out.

The RAIB investigation continues and will consider a number of factors, including Network Rail’s policies to manage risk and vegetation around the tracks.",2023-12-05 12:13:50.127308+00:00,True,True,True,True,0.7848785647132747,Salisbury train crash: clearance of leaves delayed by engineering work - The Guardian,Engineering work delay leads to train crash due to slippery tracks,"The software failure incident occurred on October 21, less than two hours before a passenger train crash in Salisbury, Wiltshire.

Multifactor authentication (MFA)  is a core defense that is among the most effective at preventing account takeovers. In addition to requiring that users provide a username and  password , MFA ensures they must also use an additional factor—be it a fingerprint, physical security key, or one-time password—before they can access an account. Nothing in this article should be construed as saying MFA isn’t anything other than essential. Ars Technica This story originally appeared on  Ars Technica , a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company, Condé Nast. That said, some forms of MFA are stronger than others, and recent events show that these weaker forms aren’t much of a hurdle for some hackers to clear. In the past few months, suspected script kiddies like the  Lapsus$ data extortion gang  and  elite Russian-state threat actors  (like Cozy Bear, the group behind the  SolarWinds hack ) have both successfully defeated the protection. Enter MFA Prompt Bombing The strongest forms of MFA are based on a framework called  FIDO2 , which was developed by a consortium of companies to balance security and simplicity of use. It gives users the option of using fingerprint readers or cameras built into their devices or dedicated security keys to confirm that they are authorized to access an account. FIDO2 forms of MFA are  relatively new , so many services for both consumers and large organizations have yet to adopt them. That’s where older, weaker forms of MFA come in. They include one-time passwords sent through SMS or generated by mobile apps like Google Authenticator or push prompts sent to a mobile device. When someone is logging in with a valid password, they also must either enter the one-time password into a field on the sign-in screen or push a button displayed on the screen of their phone. It’s this last form of authentication that recent reports say is being bypassed. One group using this technique,  according  to security firm Mandiant, is Cozy Bear, a band of elite hackers working for Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service. The group also goes under the names Nobelium, APT29, and the Dukes. “Many MFA providers allow for users to accept a phone app push notification or to receive a phone call and press a key as a second factor,” Mandiant researchers wrote. “The [Nobelium] threat actor took advantage of this and issued multiple MFA requests to the end user’s legitimate device until the user accepted the authentication, allowing the threat actor to eventually gain access to the account.” Lapsus$ , a hacking gang that has breached  Microsoft, Okta , and  Nvidia  in recent months, has also used the technique. “No limit is placed on the amount of calls that can be made,” a member of Lapsus$ wrote on the group’s official Telegram channel. “Call the employee 100 times at 1 am while he is trying to sleep, and he will more than likely accept it. Once the employee accepts the initial call, you can access the MFA enrollment portal and enroll another device.” The Lapsus$ member claimed that the MFA prompt-bombing technique was effective against Microsoft, which earlier this week said the hacking group was able to access the laptop of one of its employees. “Even Microsoft!” the person wrote. “Able to login to an employee’s Microsoft VPN from Germany and USA at the same time and they didn’t even seem to notice. Also was able to re-enroll MFA twice.” Mike Grover, a seller of red-team hacking tools for security professionals and a red-team consultant who goes by the Twitter handle  _MG_ , told Ars the technique is “fundamentally a single method that takes many forms: tricking the user to acknowledge an MFA request. ‘MFA Bombing’ has quickly become a descriptor, but this misses the more stealthy methods.” Methods include: Sending a bunch of MFA requests and hoping the target finally accepts one to make the noise stop. Sending one or two prompts per day. This method often attracts less attention, but “there is still a good chance the target will accept the MFA request.” Calling the target, pretending to be part of the company, and telling the target they need to send an MFA request as part of a company process. “Those are just a few examples,” Grover said, but it’s important to know that mass bombing is NOT the only form this takes.” In a  Twitter thread , he wrote, “Red teams have been playing with variants on this for years. It’s helped companies fortunate enough to have a red team. But real world attackers are advancing on this faster than the collective posture of most companies has been improving.” Other researchers were quick to point out that the MFA prompt technique is not new. “Lapsus$ did not invent 'MFA prompt bombing,'” Greg Linares, a red-team professional,  tweeted . “Please stop crediting them … as creating it. This attack vector has been a thing used in real world attacks 2 years before lapsus was a thing.” Good Boy, FIDO As noted earlier, FIDO2 forms of MFA aren’t susceptible to the technique, as they’re tied to the physical machine someone is using when logging in to a site. In other words, the authentication must be performed on the device that is logging in. It can’t happen on one device to give access to a different device. But that doesn’t mean organizations that use FIDO2-compliant MFA can’t be susceptible to prompt bombing. It’s inevitable that a certain percentage of people enrolled in these forms of MFA will lose their key, drop their iPhone in the toilet, or break the fingerprint reader on their laptop. Organizations must have contingencies in place to deal with these unavoidable events. Many will fall back on more vulnerable forms of MFA in the event that an employee loses the key or device required to send the additional factor. In other cases, the hacker can trick an IT administrator into resetting the MFA and enrolling a new device. In still other cases, FIDO2-compliant MFA is merely one option, but less secure forms are still permitted. “Reset/backup mechanisms are always very juicy for attackers,” Grover said. In other cases, companies that use FIDO2-compliant MFA rely on third parties to manage their network or perform other essential functions. If the third-party employees can access the company’s network with weaker forms of MFA, that largely defeats the benefit of the stronger forms. Even when companies use FIDO2-based MFA everywhere, Nobelium has been able to  defeat the protection . That bypass, however, was possible only after the hackers completely compromised a target's Active Directory, the heavily fortified database tool that network admins use to create, delete, or modify user accounts and assign them privileges to access authorized resources. That bypass is beyond the scope of this post because once an AD is hacked, it's pretty much game over. Again,  any  form of MFA is better than no use of MFA. If SMS-delivered one-time passwords are all that’s available—as fallible and distasteful as they may be—the system is still infinitely better than having  no  MFA. Nothing in this post is intended to say that MFA isn’t worth the hassle. But it’s clear that MFA on its own is not enough, and it hardly constitutes a box that organizations can check and be done with it. When Cozy Bear found these loopholes, no one was especially surprised, given the group’s infinite resources and top-notch tradecraft. Now that teenagers are using the same techniques to breach companies as powerful as Nvidia, Okta, and Microsoft, people are beginning to recognize the importance of using MFA correctly. “While it may be tempting to dismiss LAPSUS$ as an immature and fame-seeking group,” reporter Brian Krebs of KrebsOnSecurity  wrote last week , “their tactics should make anyone in charge of corporate security sit up and take notice.” MFA prompt bombing may not be new, but it’s no longer something that companies can ignore.

126299,[],2022-03-24 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10647751/Twists-fate-save-TWO-passengers-fly-doomed-Chinese-jet.html,https://www.dailymail.co.uk,,"Published on 2022-03-24 07:00:00+00:00. Incredible twists of fate ended up saving two passengers who were due to fly on the doomed Chinese jet which crashed on Monday.

The Boeing 737-800 flight from Kunming to Guangzhou smashed into the muddy ground and scattered plane parts and passenger belongings across a vast area, dashing hopes of finding any survivors.

Authorities believe all 123 passengers and nine crew who were onboard the China Eastern Airlines flight MU5735 flight are dead after the plane nosedived and slammed into a the Chinese hillside, erupting in a huge fireball and causing a forest fire visible in NASA satellite images taken from space.

On Thursday, two Chinese citizens - a man and a woman - revealed the fateful reasons they were forced to miss the flight.

The female passenger, surnamed Xin, said she was supposed to board the flight, but as she lived in a high-risk Covid-19 area, she had a star on her itinerary record and her boyfriend suggested she take a swab test first.

She therefore ended up changing her flight to the following day.

She said on social media: 'I'm in a complicated mood right now. My hands are shaking and I can't type. Thank you for your concern.

'I'm still in Yunnan, but I can't (fly) yet because I have a star (high-risk COVID-19 area) on my itinerary record.'

Meanwhile, a man surnamed Huang, said he changed his mind about boarding the plane at the last minute after his scheduled connecting flight was cancelled.

But instead of taking up an offer of flying on the doomed plane, the 24-year-old asked for a refund.

Rescuers work at the site of a plane crash on March 24, 2022 in Tengxian County, Wuzhou City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of China

The revelations come as Chinese recovery teams on Thursday found human remains at the crash site.

The search area was expanded overnight, as hundreds of searchers headed into muddy, forested hills to try to try and find the second black box.

The Boeing 737-800 was carrying 123 passengers and nine crew from Kunming in Yunnan province to Guangzhou when it crashed on Monday afternoon outside the city of Wuzhou in the Guangxi region.

Three days after the crash, larger pieces of debris were found for the first time, including engine components and a white wing section with the red and blue China Eastern logo on it, state broadcaster CCTV said.

One of the black boxes, believed to be the cockpit voice recorder, had been found Wednesday. Its outer casing was damaged but the orange cylinder was relatively intact, investigators said.

The recording material appeared to have survived the impact in relatively good shape, and was being sent to Beijing for analysis, an official said.

The cockpit voice recorder would provide investigators with details of the communications between the flight's three pilots, which is one more than is normally required on board a Boeing 737-800 plane.

The China Eastern Boeing 737-800 was cruising at 29,000 feet when it suddenly nose-dived into a remote mountainous area on Monday.

On Thursday, search teams combed ground vegetation and soil with sticks and even their bare hands on the rain-sodden slopes, according to state television. Some of them also carried thermal cameras to detect signs of life.

A distraught relative, her arms supported by two men, arrived at the entrance point to the crash site as she wiped tears from her eyes.

Under pouring rain, she joined scores of firefighters, paramilitary police and reporters to trudge across the rough terrain to where eviscerated chunks of jet have been found.

Drones were readied for deployment to survey the core area of the crash site and capture images to be assessed by experts, state media said. Other drones that can be airborne for more than 12 hours will be deployed to provide night-time light.

Pumps were also being used to drain a water pond as an off-and-on light rain hampered the search effort for a second straight day. More than 300 searchers were taking part, said Huang Shangwu, a deputy chief in the Guangxi Fire and Rescue Department.

'The water pumping yesterday greatly contributed to the finding of the black box,' Huang told reporters at a command center inside a wide restricted zone that has been blocked off by authorities.

Searchers have been using hand tools, metal detectors, drones and sniffer dogs to comb the heavily forested and steep slopes. Wallets, identity and bank cards and human remains have been found.

CCTV news showed police in olive- and dark-coloured rain gear standing in a cleared area on Thursday, some with bare or white-gloved hands atop long-handled tools that appear to be shovels or sickles. They all wore surgical masks.

Recovering the so-called black boxes - they are usually painted orange for visibility - is considered key to figuring out what caused the crash.

Cockpit voice recorders can capture voices, audio alerts and background sounds from the engine or even switches being moved. The flight data recorder stores information about the plane's airspeed, altitude and direction up or down, as well as pilot actions and the performance of important systems.

Investigators have said it is too early to speculate on the cause. An air-traffic controller tried to contact the pilots several times after seeing the plane's altitude drop sharply, but got no reply, officials have said.

The China Eastern flight was headed from Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, to Guangzhou, a major city and export manufacturing hub on China's southeastern coast. China Eastern, headquartered in Shanghai, is one of China's four major airlines.

According to flight tracking website FlightRadar24, the plane briefly appeared to pull out of its nosedive, before plunging again into a heavily forested slope in the mountainous Guangxi region of southern China.

Chinese authorities said the pilots did not respond to repeated calls from air traffic controllers during the rapid descent. Investigators said the plane stopped transmitting data 96 seconds into the fall.

It is too early to determine the cause of the crash, which experts say are usually the result of a combination of factors.

On Wednesday, video clips posted by China's state media showed small pieces of the Boeing 737-800 scattered over the crash site. Each piece of debris had a number next to it, the larger ones marked off by police tape.

The crash investigation is being led by China, but the United States was invited to take part because the plane was designed and manufactured there.

The plane, flight number MU5735 from Kunming to Guangzhou, got into trouble over the city of Wuzhou, before it plummeted 29,100ft into a mountainside on Monday

Investigators were seen inspecting a black box from the crashed Chinese jet which was found on Wednesday

The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said on Wednesday it had not yet determined if investigators would travel to China because of the strict visa and quarantine requirements.

Local media identified the captain of the aircraft as being Yang Hongda, the son of a former airline pilot, who aviation professionals said had an 'excellent' safety record.

The first officer was named as Zhang Zhengping, a 58-year-old with 40 years experience and more than 30,000 hours of safe flying, reported the Times.

A rescue official reportedly said the plane had completely disintegrated while a fire sparked by the crash ripped through bamboo and trees before being put out. China Eastern expressed 'deep condolences' after confirming the fatalities of 123 passengers and nine crew who were onboard, adding that all the victims were Chinese.



Horrifying CCTV footage emerged on social media supposedly showing the jet racing vertically towards the ground in the moments before the smash.

FlightRadar tracking data showed the aircraft cruising at 29,100ft at 2.20pm. Around two minutes later it had plummeted to just over 9,000ft and 20 seconds after that it had fallen to just 3,225ft. The data indicates a vertical descent of 31,000ft per minute or around 350 mph.

Altitude data also appears to show aircraft regain height at around 7,5000ft before beginning its final descent.

The incident represents China's deadliest air crash in nearly three decades. The deadliest Chinese commercial flight accident was a China Northwest Airlines crash in 1994, which killed all 160 onboard.

China Eastern is based in Shanghai and is one of China's three largest carriers with more than 600 planes, including 109 Boeing 737-800s.

Altitude data also appears to show aircraft regain height at around 7,5000ft before beginning its final descent, although commentators have warned the figures could be anomalies

China's transport ministry said China Eastern has grounded all of its 737-800s, a move that could further disrupt domestic air travel already curtailed because of the largest Covid-19 outbreak in China since the initial peak in early 2020.

The Boeing 737-800 has been flying since 1998 and has a well-established safety record. It is an earlier model than the 737 Max, which was grounded worldwide for nearly two years after deadly crashes in 2018 and 2019.

In August 2010, an Embraer ERJ 190-100 operated by Henan Airlines hit the ground short of the runway in the north-eastern city of Yichun and caught fire.

127376,[],2022-04-08 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-uses-ai-software-improve-its-surveillance-capabilities-2022-04-08/,https://www.reuters.com,,"Published on 2022-04-08 07:00:00+00:00. BEIJING, April 8 (Reuters) - Dozens of Chinese firms have built software that uses artificial intelligence to sort data collected on residents, amid high demand from authorities seeking to upgrade their surveillance tools, a Reuters review of government documents shows.

According to more than 50 publicly available documents examined by Reuters, dozens of entities in China have over the past four years bought such software, known as ""one person, one file"". The technology improves on existing software, which simply collects data but leaves it to people to organise.

“The system has the ability to learn independently and can optimize the accuracy of file creation as the amount of data increases. (Faces that are) partially blocked, masked, or wearing glasses, and low-resolution portraits can also be archived relatively accurately,” according to a tender published in July by the public security department of Henan, China’s third-largest province by population. read more

Henan's department of public security did not respond to requests for comment about the system and its uses.

The new software improves on Beijing's current approach to surveillance. Although China's existing systems can collect data on individuals, law enforcement and other users have been left to organise it.

Another limitation of current surveillance software is its inability to connect an individual’s personal details to a real-time location except at security checkpoints such as those in airports, according to Jeffrey Ding, a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford's Center for International Security and Cooperation.

One person, one file ""is a way of sorting information that makes it easier to track individuals,"" said Mareike Ohlberg, a Berlin-based senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund.

China's Department of Public Security, which oversees regional police authorities, did not respond to a request for comment about one person, one file and its surveillance uses. Besides the police units, 10 bids were opened by Chinese Communist Party bodies responsible for political and legal affairs. China's Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission declined to comment.

The tenders examined by Reuters represent a fraction of such efforts by Chinese police units and Party bodies to upgrade surveillance networks by tapping into the power of big data and AI, according to three industry experts interviewed for this story.

According to government documents, some of the software's users, such as schools, wanted to monitor unfamiliar faces outside their compounds.

The majority, such as police units in southwestern Sichuan province's Ngawa prefecture, mainly populated by Tibetans, ordered it for more explicit security purposes. The Ngawa tender describes the software as being for ""maintaining political security, social stability and peace among the people.""

Ngawa's department of public security did not respond to requests for comment.

Beijing says its monitoring is crucial to combating crime and has been key to its efforts to fight the spread of COVID-19. Human rights activists such as Human Rights Watch say that the country is building a surveillance state that infringes on privacy and unfairly targets certain groups, such the Uyghur Muslim minority.

The Reuters review shows that local authorities across the country, including in highly populated districts of Beijing and underdeveloped provinces like Gansu, have opened at least 50 tenders in the four years since the first patent application, 32 of which were opened for bidding in 2021. Twenty-two tech companies, including Sensetime, Huawei, Megvii, Cloudwalk, Dahua, and the cloud division of Baidu, now offer such software, according to a Reuters review.

Sensetime declined to comment. Megvii, Cloudwalk, Dahua, and the cloud division of Baidu did not respond to requests for comment.

Huawei said in a statement that a partner had developed the one person, one file application in its smart city platform. The company declined to comment on the patent applications.

""Huawei does not develop or sell applications that target any specific group of people,"" the company said.

The documents Reuters reviewed span 22 of China's 31 main administrative divisions, and all levels of provincial government, from regional public security departments to Party offices for a single neighbourhood.

The new systems aim to make sense of the giant troves of data such entities collect, using complex algorithms and machine learning to create customised files for individuals, according to the government tenders. The files update themselves automatically as the software sorts data.

A wide range of challenges can complicate implementation, however. Bureaucracy and even cost can create a fragmented and disjointed nationwide network, three AI and surveillance experts told Reuters.

Reuters found announcements for successful bids for more than half of the 50 procurement documents analysed, with values between a few million yuan and close to 200 million yuan.

SYSTEM UPGRADE

China blanketed its cities with surveillance cameras in a 2015-2020 campaign it described as ""sharp eyes"" and is striving to do the same across rural areas. The development and adoption of the ""one person, one file"" software began around the same time.

Ohlberg, the researcher, said the earliest mention she had seen of one person, one file was from 2016, in a 200-page surveillance feasibility study by Shawan county in Xinjiang, for acquiring a computer system that could “automatically identify and investigate key persons involved in terrorism and (threatening social) stability.” A Shawan county official declined to comment.

In 2016, China's domestic security chief at the time, Meng Jianzhu, wrote in a state-run journal that big data was the key to finding crime patterns and trends. Two years later, the system was referenced in a speech to industry executives given by Li Ziqing, then-director of the Research Center for Biometrics and Security Technology of the state-run Chinese Academy of Sciences. Li also was chief scientist at AuthenMetric, a Beijing-based facial recognition company. Neither the research centre nor AuthenMetric responded to requests for comment.

""The ultimate core technology of big data’s (application to) security is one person, one file,"" Li said in the 2018 speech at an AI forum in Shenzhen, according to a transcript of the speech published by local media and shared on AuthenMetric’s WeChat public account.

The Party's Political and Legal Affairs Commission, which Meng led in 2016, declined to comment. Meng could not be reached for comment. Li did not respond to a request for comment.

The industry developed quickly. By 2021, Huawei, Sensetime, and 26 other Chinese tech companies had filed patent applications with the World Intellectual Property Organization for file archiving and image clustering algorithms.

A 2021 Huawei patent application for a ""person database partitioning method and device"" that mentioned one person, one file said that ""as smart cameras become more popular in the future, the number of captured facial images in a city will grow to trillions per year”.

SAFE CITIES

The 50 tenders Reuters analysed give varying amounts of detail on how the software would be used.

Some mentioned ""one person, one file"" as a single entry on a list of needed items for surveillance systems. Others gave detailed descriptions.

Nine of the tenders indicated the software would be used with facial recognition technology that could, the documents specified, identify whether a passerby was Uyghur, connecting to early warning systems for the police and creating archives of Uyghur faces.

One tender published in February 2020 by a Party organ responsible for an area in the southeastern island province of Hainan, for instance, sought a database of Uyghur and Tibetan residents to facilitate “finding the information of persons involved in terrorism.”

The Hainan authorities did not respond to a request for comment.

More than a dozen tenders mention the need to combat terrorism and “maintain stability”, a catch-all term that human rights activists say is often used to mean repressing dissent.

At least four of the tenders said the software should be able to pull information from the individual's social media accounts. Half of the tenders said the software would be used to compile and analyse personal details such as relatives, social circles, vehicle records, marriage status, and shopping habits.

128447,[],2022-06-01 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/01/politics/fbi-blames-iran-hospital-cyberattack/index.html,https://www.cnn.com,,"Published on 2022-06-01 07:00:00+00:00. CNN —

Iranian government-backed hackers were behind an attempted hack of the Boston Children’s Hospital computer network last year, FBI Director Christopher Wray alleged Wednesday, calling it “one of the most despicable cyberattacks I’ve ever seen.”

The FBI was able to help thwart the hackers before they did damage to the hospital’s computer network, according to Wray, but he cited it as an example of the potential high-impact hacking threats that the US faces from the governments of Iran, Russia, China and North Korea.

“We cannot let up on China or Iran or criminal syndicates while we’re focused on Russia,” Wray said in a speech at Boston College.

The hack, which took place in June 2021, saw the attackers exploit popular software made by California-based firm Fortinet to control the hospital’s computer network, according to US officials.

Boston Children’s Hospital is a more than 400-bed facility and is considered one of the premier pediatric centers in the US.

The FBI got a tip about the Iranian hackers from a “valued partner within the intelligence community,” and the activity was thwarted before it was clear what the hackers’ end goal on the hospital’s network was, according to Joseph Bonavolonta, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Boston Field Office.

“There was no ransomware deployed,” Bonavolonta told reporters Wednesday, “and we were able to work with [the hospital] ahead of time to mitigate any of the other potential associated threats to the network.”

Wray had previously said in March that the Iranian government-linked hackers were behind a cyberattack on a children’s hospital, but he didn’t name the hospital.

“Thanks to the FBI and our Boston Children’s Hospital staff working so closely together, we proactively thwarted the threat to our network,” Kristen Dattoli, a spokesperson for the hospital, said in a statement.

Shahrokh Nazemi, a spokesperson for Iran’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations, called the FBI claim a “baseless allegation” and “an example of psychological warfare against Iran and thus of no value.”

Ransomware and other hacking threats have stalked the health care system for years — and appear to have gotten worse during the coronavirus pandemic.

There were 134 publicly reported ransomware incidents involving health care organizations in 2021, up from 106 incidents in 2020, according to threat-intelligence firm Recorded Future.

The Boston Children’s Hospital incident was one of several that prompted a public warning last November from the FBI and other agencies that Iranian government-backed hackers were targeting a range of organizations across the transportation and health care sectors.

The advisory was a rare case of the US government publicly linking Iran with ransomware, which is typically used by cybercriminals rather than governments. But US officials and private analysts have long warned of collusion between foreign governments and criminal hacking groups.

When it comes to potential Russian hacking threats to the US, the FBI has been on a “combat tempo,” with a 24/7 command post, during the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine, Wray added.

“We’ve seen the Russian government taking specific preparatory steps towards potential destructive [cyber]attacks, both here and abroad,” he added.

Such a “destructive” hack — in which data or systems are destroyed — hasn’t been reported in the US since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But suspected Russian hackers have conducted a slew of destructive hacks in Ukraine, and US officials are warning businesses to not let their guard down.

The same network access gained by Russian operatives to collect intelligence could be used for a destructive hack, Wray warned. “That’s why, when it comes to Russia today, we’re focused on acting as early – as far ‘left of boom,’ as they say – as we can.”

“We’re watching for their cyber activities to become more destructive as the war keeps going poorly for them,” Wray said Wednesday.

134921,[],2022-11-09 08:00:00+00:00,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/21/business/social-security-work-retirement.html,https://www.nytimes.com,,"Published on 2022-11-09 08:00:00+00:00.  After a long career in marketing for an engineering firm, Jim Keller retired at 63. It wasn’t an abrupt halt — he had the opportunity to phase out of full-time work, and took some consulting gigs. Yet a little more than a year later, in 2017, Mr. Keller said, he felt restless. Several months of playing golf and completing projects around his house in Napa, Calif., hadn’t been satisfying. So he decided to study for a real estate license and went back to work. But that second transition came with a big concern: how Mr. Keller, now 69, would manage his earned income without horribly disrupting his Social Security benefits. Working with  Kelly Crane , a certified financial planner with the Wealth Enhancement Group, Mr. Keller learned that he could bolster his retirement savings while working and deferring withdrawals from his 401(k). Exploring scenarios with various incomes and expenses, Mr. Crane showed Mr. Keller how he could maintain his lifestyle and still maximize Social Security benefits. Since he enjoys his work, Mr. Keller said, he may not “re-retire” until 72, the age when he will be required to  take minimum withdrawals  from his 401(k). His wife, Renee, is 65 and retired. “I have no plan to take a total retirement,” he said. “We’re taking it year by year.” The reasons for un-retiring are myriad — an unusually large  cost-of-living raise for Social Security  won’t completely hedge against high inflation; some people realized they hadn’t saved enough; and others found that retirement wasn’t keeping them engaged. Americans in their seventh decade are making up a slightly larger part of the work force, studies show. In January 2020, about 37 percent of Americans ages 62 to 70 were employed, according to  research  by Alicia Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. By April 2020, that percentage had fallen to 30, but it bounced back to 36 by August this year. The uptick was attributed to people returning to work. Many Americans who have claimed Social Security find that working triggers some complex decision-making that involves a nuanced look at that benefit and Medicare and some short-term financial planning. Social Security’s earnings test If you work while taking benefits but before you reach what is known as full retirement age, or F.R.A., your benefits will be reduced. What is F.R.A.? It is generally 66 or 67, but depends on your birth year. The Social Security Administration calculates that reduction based on an earnings test. The good news: The benefits you lose while working aren’t withheld forever. Working will generally cut your payment for earnings above a threshold set by Social Security. In 2022, that threshold is $19,560. Social Security’s rules about calculating the withheld benefits are complex. One way to look at it: If you reach your F.R.A. in 2023, but work all of 2022, your benefits this year will be reduced by $1 for every $2 you earn over the limit. And if you keep working into 2023, they will be reduced $1 for every $3 until the month you hit F.R.A. “If you started working again before your full retirement age, be careful,” said Cassandra Kirby, a certified financial planner with  Braun-Bostich & Associates  in Canonsburg, Pa. There are two ways to avoid this problem in retirement: Either stop working entirely, or tell the Social Security Administration that you want a suspension, or “withdrawal,” of your benefits, which will stop payments. Timing is important, Ms. Kirby said. People who are not at F.R.A. have a one-year window after first taking benefits to suspend them. Once you reach F.R.A., your monthly benefit will be increased permanently to account for the months in which benefits were withheld, according to Social Security’s rules. If you miss that window, you must wait until you reach full retirement age (and before you turn 70) to suspend. What’s more: You can suspend benefits just once in your lifetime.

Jason Henry for The New York Times If you can afford it, waiting to take Social Security is often an option that works best. About 11 years ago, Barbara Brownell Grogan of Charlottesville, Va., decided at 57 to retire as a book editor for National Geographic and start a publishing consulting business. She took Social Security only two years ago, when she reached full retirement age, to avoid the benefit cut. She said she might hold off on “complete retirement”  until 70, the age at which everyone who waits  can earn a substantially higher benefit. Ms. Grogan’s husband, Daniel, also waited, until he was 66, to avoid a reduction in benefits. Although he has retired from his job as a photographer, he manages some real estate he owns in Charlottesville. Although she relished her 27 years at National Geographic, “I’m doing what I love,” Ms. Grogan said. Part of the reason she retired the first time was to care for her husband during an illness. Ms. Grogan’s nephew  Sam Brownell , a chartered financial analyst with Stratus Wealth Advisors in Kensington, Md., walked her through a number of software-driven cash-flow scenarios involving Social Security. They projected that she might live into her mid-90s. Part of their discussions involved a lump sum she took from her 401(k) plan. She was not penalized by Social Security or taxed on the withdrawal because she  rolled it over  into an individual retirement account. With Social Security benefits, the key factors in maximizing your benefits are how much you earned during your working years and at what age you take benefits.  The highest possible basic individual monthly retirement payment  is for those who wait until 70. In the case of married couples,  spouses  can file starting at 62 and may receive as much as half of their partner’s primary benefit. Spouses can also apply when they are older to qualify for higher payments at their own full retirement age or file on their own earnings record, which may net an even higher benefit. In any case, it’s wise to run several maximization scenarios that will crunch the numbers quickly  with off-the-shelf software  or with a  certified financial planner. The effect of earnings on Medicare Getting back into the work force may bring another surprise: Premiums for Medicare Parts B and D could increase if you earn significantly more money. Premiums for Part B, which covers doctors’ visits and outpatient services, are deducted from your Social Security payments; Part D covers prescription drugs. Most Medicare enrollees pay what is called the standard premium for Part B; in 2023, that amount will be $164.90 a month, a decrease from $170.10 in 2022. The average basic Part D premium for 2023 is projected to be $31.50, a slight decrease from 2022. For those who pay more than the standard premium, Medicare has a complicated means-testing process to determine their outlay. If you earn income above a certain level, you may be subject to the Medicare  IRMAA , or income-related monthly adjustment amount — a surcharge on your Part B and Part D premiums. You will know if you’re over the limit when you get a notice from the Social Security Administration, but you can still plan ahead. The  income thresholds for Medicare premium upcharges  are on a sliding scale. If you are single and your annual adjusted gross income was more than $91,000 and under $114,000, your monthly Part B premium is $238.10 this year; Part D is $12.40. The top end of the IRMAA scale — for those filing jointly and earning above $750,000 — is $578.30 a month for Part B and $77.90 for Part D. The reasoning behind the differences is that high-earning seniors can afford to pay more, and for them, the elevated premiums are probably not a game changer. But most people should be mindful of any additional income that may throw them into the higher premium ranges. Medicare will also look  at income bump-ups  that come from a variety of sources, such as the sale of a business or investment profits. “Large capital gains may throw you into the high-income range,” Ms. Kirby said. When evaluating your income, she added, Social Security can look back two years to calculate any premium surcharges. Revisiting your plan Let’s say your short-range plan has morphed into a longer one that includes working for a few more years. Among the factors to consider: Do you want to travel? How is your health? Do you plan to relocate? If you’re coming up short on financing your post-postretirement plan, you may have to figure out how you will continue to save. For some people, planning for money to last even into a 10th decade makes sense. Ms. Kirby advises that people do a “stress test” using various ages for final retirement that takes into account their lifestyle goals, life expectancy, tax bracket and investment strategy. “If you’re single and expect a shorter life expectancy,” she said, “then I would collect benefits as soon as possible. Those who are looking at a longer life expectancy can afford to wait.” For those who need to save more until they re-retire, a  Roth I.R.A.  is a worthy consideration, if your income qualifies you. While contributions are taxed, withdrawals are not, if you leave the money in the account for at least five years. For those who are self-employed, a  SEP I.R.A.  can be a good choice, Mr. Crane said. Although you may be hit with the Social Security reduction if you’re drawing benefits while working, the money you sock away (combined with investment returns) into a defined-contribution plan, and the tax break for doing so, may offset the Social Security hit before full retirement age. You may be surprised when you remodel your retirement: Bolstered by a more robust savings cushion and higher level of cognition and social activity from working, your re-retirement may even be better than your original one.",2023-12-07 05:25:27.038641+00:00,True,False,,,,Working While on Social Security: What to Know - The New York Times,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
