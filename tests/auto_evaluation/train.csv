17,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/27/us/27radiation.html,2010-01-26 08:00:00+00:00,https://www.nytimes.com,,"Published on 2010-01-27 00:00:00.  In New Jersey, 36 cancer patients at a veterans hospital in East Orange were overradiated  and 20 more received substandard treatment  by a medical team that lacked experience in using a machine that generated high-powered beams of radiation. The mistakes, which have not been publicly reported, continued for months because the hospital had no system in place to catch the errors. In Louisiana, Landreaux A. Donaldson received 38 straight overdoses of radiation, each nearly twice the prescribed amount, while undergoing treatment for prostate cancer. He was treated with a machine so new that the hospital made a miscalculation even with training instructors still on site.  In Texas, George Garst now wears two external bags  one for urine and one for fecal matter  because of severe radiation injuries he suffered after a medical physicist who said he was overworked failed to detect a mistake. The overdose was never reported to the authorities because rules did not require it. These mistakes and the failure of hospitals to quickly identify them offer a rare look into the vulnerability of patient safeguards at a time when increasingly complex, computer-controlled devices are fundamentally changing medical radiation, delivering higher doses in less time with greater precision than ever before.  Serious radiation injuries are still infrequent, and the new equipment is undeniably successful in diagnosing and fighting disease. But the technology introduces its own risks: it has created new avenues for error in software and operation, and those mistakes can be more difficult to detect. As a result, a single error that becomes embedded in a treatment plan can be repeated in multiple radiation sessions.  Many of these mistakes could have been caught had basic checking protocols been followed, accident reports show. But there is also a growing realization among those who work with this new technology that some safety procedures are outdated.  “Scientific societies haven’t been able to keep up with the rapid pace of technical improvements,” said  Jeffrey F. Williamson , a professor of radiation oncology, who leads the medical physics division at the Massey Cancer Center at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond. Hospitals, too, are lagging, sometimes failing to provide the necessary financial support to operate the sophisticated devices safely, according to accident reports and medical physicists, who set up and monitor radiological devices. And manufacturers sometimes sell machines before all the software bugs are identified and removed, records show. At a 2007 conference on radiation safety, medical physicists went so far as to warn that radiation oncology “does indeed face a crisis.” The gap between advancing technology and outdated safety protocols leaves “physicists and radiation oncologists without a clear strategy for maintaining the quality and safety of treatment,” the group reported. Government regulators have been slow to respond. Radiation accidents are chronically underreported, and a patchwork of laws to protect patients from harm are weak or unevenly applied, creating an environment where the new technology has outpaced its oversight, where hospitals that violate safety rules, injure patients and fail to report mistakes often face little or no punishment, The New York Times has found. In this largely unregulated marketplace, manufacturers compete by offering the latest in technology, with only a cursory review by the government, and hospitals buy the equipment to lure patients and treat them more quickly. Radiation-generating machines are so ubiquitous that used ones are even sold on eBay. “Vendors are selling to anyone,” said  Eric E. Klein , a medical physicist and professor of radiation oncology at Washington University in St. Louis. “New technologies were coming into the clinics without people thinking through from Step 1 to Step 112 to make sure everything is going to be done right.” A national testing service recently found unacceptable variations in doses delivered by a now common form of machine-generated radiation called Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy, or I.M.R.T. To help institutions achieve more consistency, an association of medical physicists issued new I.M.R.T. guidelines in November.  The problems also extend to equipment used to diagnose disease. More than 300 patients in four hospitals  and possibly many more  were overradiated by powerful CT scans used to detect strokes, government health officials announced late last year. The overdoses were first discovered at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, a major Los Angeles hospital, where 260 patients received up to eight times as much radiation as intended.  Those errors continued for 18 months and were detected only after patients started losing their hair. The federal Food and Drug Administration is still struggling to understand and untangle the physics underlying the flawed protocols. The F.D.A. has issued a nationwide alert for hospitals to be especially careful when using CT scans on possible stroke victims.  Although the overdoses at Cedars-Sinai were displayed on computer screens, technicians administering the scans did not notice. In New York City, technologists who also did not watch their treatment computers contributed to two devastating radiation injuries documented in an article in The Times on Sunday.  The incidents not only highlight the peril of placing too much trust in computers, they also raise questions about the training and oversight of medical physicists and radiation therapists.  Despite the pivotal role medical physicists play in ensuring patient safety, at least 16 states and the District of Columbia do not require licensing or registration. “States can be either very tough or very lax,” said Dr.  Paul E. Wallner , a director of the American Board of Radiology.  Eight states allow technologists to perform medical imaging other than mammographies with no credentials or educational requirements.  In those states, said  Robert Pizzutiello , a medical physicist in New York who is part of a movement to license all medical physicists, “you could drive a truck in the morning and operate an X-ray in the afternoon.”  Turmoil at the V.A.  Frederick Stein, an Army veteran from New Jersey, was already suffering from a delayed diagnosis of laryngeal cancer when he began radiation treatments in late September 2006 at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in East Orange. Within weeks of starting radiotherapy, his sore throat worsened and a rash appeared along with other skin problems, according to Mr. Stein’s family.  Swallowing became more difficult, causing him to lose weight. His skin eruptions worsened. Mr. Stein’s pain became so severe, he needed an injection of morphine. More painkillers followed. The hospital stopped chemotherapy, figuring it was causing his problems. But his condition continued to deteriorate.  If Mr. Stein’s skin damage was a mystery to his doctors, two therapists  Alisha High and Lorraine Raymond  had already concluded that he was being overradiated. Ms. High was so concerned that in December 2006 she refused to administer the radiation, records show. The next day, Ms. Raymond expressed her concerns as well. The protest did not go over well. Their supervisor, Kirk Krickmier, admonished them for questioning doctors and the physics department, and later that month, both therapists were fired by the agency that had placed them in the veterans’ hospital, Rosato Associates, according to a lawsuit Ms. High and Ms. Raymond filed against Rosato.

Lee/The New York Times Mr. Stein died of cancer in 2008 at age 71, but not before the hospital admitted that he had been overradiated. His wife, Eileen Stein, said the botched radiation treatments had shortened his life. “Oh, it was just awful,” Ms. Stein said in an interview. “They cooked him something terrible. He suffered awful.”  Ms. High and Ms. Raymond declined to be interviewed for this article. Steven Menaker, a lawyer who represented Rosato Associates, said his client disputed their account of why they left the hospital. Mr. Krickmier declined to be interviewed about the case, which has been settled.  It turned out that Mr. Stein was not the only victim. Having learned of the therapists’ complaints on Dec. 20, 2006, hospital administrators tracked them down a month later and interviewed them, according to Veterans Affairs. A week later, the director of the East Orange facility, Kenneth H. Mizrach, ordered the radiotherapy unit to stop accepting new patients, pending a full investigation.  That investigation found that of 160 cases reviewed, 56 patients were treated incorrectly for cancer of the prostate, head and neck, lung, breast and two other malignancies. Thirty-six had been overradiated and 20 more subjected to “errors in technique,” the hospital said. Although the patients were informed, the findings had not been publicly revealed until The Times uncovered them. According to a confidential report by the American College of Radiology, which had been brought in to study the situation, the hospital’s radiotherapy unit was out of control: medical personnel lacked the training and knowledge to safely administer I.M.R.T. treatments, quality control was virtually nonexistent, vital safety procedures were performed by unqualified employees, and patients had little or no follow-up. “Discontinuation of I.M.R.T. treatment is STRONGLY recommended until additional training is obtained by all staff including the physicians,” the college said. The reviewers reminded the hospital that the new technology was “VERY labor intensive, and requires not just sophisticated hardware and software, but a lot more training.” The college said medical personnel were “really pushing the envelope of tolerances” and that nonphysicians were apparently approving  in the physician’s name  certain steps in the treatment process.  Investigators found that without proper follow-up, there was no way for the hospital to know whether its cancer treatments were successful or whether there were complications. In addition, the college of radiology found no evidence of peer review, quality assurance meetings, outcome studies or mortality and morbidity (known as M&M) conferences, where doctors meet to review cases. “Several charts reviewed indicated that treatment had been discontinued or at least interrupted by a patient’s worsening condition, or in a few cases death, but there was no M&M review of these issues,” the report said. A spokeswoman for the V.A. said most of the affected patients suffered no apparent harm.  The unit remains closed; it is expected to reopen soon with all new personnel and equipment. “It took a long time to get here  three years in the making,” Mr. Mizrach said. “Without question, this was a dark part of this medical center, but I would hate this to be a defining moment of what this institution is about.”  Checks and Errors  When inspectors from the  Radiological Physics Center , a federally financed testing service, arrived at the  Moffitt Cancer Center  in Tampa, Fla., in 2005, they uncovered something alarming: a miscalibrated machine that overradiated 77 brain cancer patients by 50 percent in 2004 and 2005.  A new linear accelerator had been set up incorrectly, and the hospital’s routine checks could not detect the error because they merely confirmed that the output had not changed from the first day.  “Errors of this magnitude are very rare,” said Geoffrey S. Ibbott, director of the physics center. But the center’s tests have shown that inaccuracies in the delivery of machine-generated radiation are not uncommon.  Dr. Ibbott’s group also reported in 2008 that among hospitals seeking admission into clinical trials, nearly 30 percent failed to accurately irradiate an object, called a phantom, that mimicked the human head and neck. The hospitals were all using I.M.R.T., which shapes and varies the intensity of radiation beams to more accurately attack the tumor, while sparing healthy tissue. “This is a sobering statistic, especially considering that this is a sample of those institutions that felt confident enough in their I.M.R.T. planning and delivery process to apply for credentialing and presumably expected to pass,” said a task group investigating I.M.R.T. guidelines for the  American Association of Physicists in Medicine . The group’s report, published in November, said the failure rate “strongly suggests” that some clinics had not adequately performed the initial tests to make sure their equipment was set up correctly.  “Errors like the one at Moffitt, and other errors that we have detected at other facilities, would be much less likely to have occurred if, every time a new piece of radiation therapy equipment were installed, there was some sort of independent check of the type that we do,” Dr. Ibbott said in an interview last year. “If we had gone to Moffitt eight months earlier, perhaps none of those patients would have received the higher dose.” Another set of tests from 2000 to 2008 found that 15 percent to 20 percent of hospitals using linear accelerators in clinical trials had at least one radiation beam outside the acceptable range.  “We haven’t been sufficiently outspoken about this, although we are now in the process of correcting that,” said Dr. Ibbott, whose group is based at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. Hospitals sometimes embrace new technologies before medical personnel can agree on how best to use them.  James Deye, a program director in radiation research at the National Cancer Institute, watched with concern as the popularity of I.M.R.T. exploded before there were national standards. Dr. Deye said he established minimum I.M.R.T. guidelines for institutions wishing to participate in cancer trials. “The community was going along merrily and happily without those guidelines,” he said.  Dr. Ibbott’s testing service can help clinics improve the performance of their linear accelerators if they are in clinical trials. Operators not in trials can pay to have their units tested by a sister group of the Physics Center. Even so, many do not.  “There are clearly places that don’t avail themselves of the service, even though it is well known and very affordable,” Dr. Ibbott said. “I guess they don’t want someone else checking them for some reason.” In radiotherapy, eschewing an outside, independent review is a calculated gamble.  “If you radiate a person wrong, there’s no repeat  you can’t say, ‘Let’s forget about that one and do it correct next time,’ ” said  George X. Ding , a medical physicist at the Vanderbilt Center for Radiation Oncology in Nashville. “It’s not like you do a measurement of a phantom and it went wrong and you can do it again.” Steeper Learning Curve  Last fall, in the vast exhibition hall at McCormick Place in Chicago, dozens of companies from around the world displayed their latest radiological weapons in the war on cancer.  Image Frederick Stein died in 2008. Credit... The Star-Ledger Photo Library “That’s our newest linear accelerator,” said Hans-Jörg Freyer of Siemens Healthcare, standing in front of his company’s Artiste model, which combines imaging with therapy. Sophisticated, yet easy to use, it is capable of treating 80 patients a day, Mr. Freyer said.  Dee Mathieson, of the Swedish company  Elekta , said imaging technology in their linear accelerator improved accuracy. “What has changed is the software that allows us to unleash some of these new techniques,” Ms. Mathieson said. Over the last two decades, the industry has developed generations of machines, each designed to more precisely attack tumors, allowing doctors to administer higher doses of radiation with less risk to healthy tissue.  Linear accelerators once used radioactive beams crudely shaped as blocks or rectangles. Since tumors do not grow in straight lines, healthy tissue was sometimes irradiated along with the cancer. To minimize collateral damage, technicians manually inserted blocks and filters, a task later taken over by computers. Computers eventually were able to produce three-dimensional images of tumors  a major advancement  and linear accelerators used software that contoured beams to conform to the shape of the tumor. The next step, I.M.R.T., allowed doctors to more precisely tailor the shape and intensity of the beams. The latest generation of machines, which were on display at McCormick Place, incorporates sophisticated imaging.  The F.D.A. waved these advancements through with little review on the grounds that they just extended existing technology. But there are dissenters. “It’s so much more than that,” said Dr. Deye, the National Cancer Institute official. “The issues surrounding advanced technologies are far-reaching.”  Even if the devices work as intended, hospitals face a steep learning curve.  In 2005, when Landreaux A. Donaldson underwent therapy for prostate cancer at Mary Bird Perkins Cancer Center in Baton Rouge, La., the linear accelerator was so new the vendor’s training instructors were still in the hospital, records show. The accelerator delivered radiation in a radically different way, emitting tiny beams of radiation from many points on a spiral encircling the patient.  In treating Mr. Donaldson, the hospital used the wrong type of CT treatment scan for the machine, prompting medical personnel to compensate by doing what is called “a work around”  a departure from established procedure. But because they were unfamiliar with the treatment planning software, they made a miscalculation that affected all 38 treatments, stretching over two months, according to state records and a lawsuit filed by Mr. Donaldson. The next year, Mr. Donaldson began experiencing stomach ulcers, anemia and urethral stricture, which required surgery. He also underwent hyperbaric oxygen treatments, where pure pressurized oxygen is used to promote healing. Neither the hospital nor Mr. Donaldson would comment on the lawsuit, which has been settled.  As therapies become more complex, there is more to check  sometimes too much, say some medical physicists.  “When it exceeds certain levels of complexity, there is not enough time and not enough resources to check the behavior of a complicated device to every possible, conceivable kind of input,” said Dr. Williamson, the medical physicist from Virginia.  As the person most responsible for ensuring that an optimal radiation dose is delivered safely, the medical physicist must make sure that new machines are set up properly; that daily warm-up checks are carried out, along with more extensive monthly and annual evaluations; and that individual treatments are administered as prescribed. Computers can provide only so much help. In the past, they checked the work of radiotherapists, but now therapists check the computers, said Howard I. Amols, chief of clinical physics at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.  The problem, Dr. Amols said, is that computers are better at checking humans than humans are at checking computers. “The responsibility on Day 1 to make everything right is much more important than it used to be,” he said. “We are still grappling with how we do that.” Hospitals sometimes aggravate the problem, buying new technology without adding the employees needed to operate it safely, according to a report issued on a 2007 conference sponsored by two radiological associations and the National Cancer Institute. And hospitals complain that manufacturers sometimes release new equipment with software that is poorly designed, contains glitches or lacks fail-safe features, records show. Northwest Medical Physics Equipment in Everett, Wash., had to release seven software patches to fix its image-guided radiation treatments, according to a December 2007 warning letter from the F.D.A. Hospitals reported that the company’s flawed software caused several cancer patients to receive incorrect treatment, government records show. In another case, an unnamed medical facility told federal officials in 2008 that Philips Healthcare made treatment planning software with an obscure, automatic default setting, causing a patient with tonsil cancer to be mistakenly irradiated 31 times in the optic nerve. “The default occurred without the knowledge of the physician or techs,” the facility said, according to F.D.A. records. In a statement, Peter Reimer of Philips Healthcare said its software functioned as intended and that operator error caused the mistake.  Patchwork of Regulation  When George Garst was treated in 2004 for prostate cancer at Christus Spohn Hospital in Corpus Christi, Tex., his caregivers were subject to the following regulations:  The first half of his radiation treatment  external beam therapy  was overseen by the state radiological division operating under one set of rules. The second half of his treatment  radioactive seeds  was subject to a second set of rules established by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, except that the commission passed its responsibility on to the state, which must follow some, but not all, of the commission’s rules. In any case, the second rules differ from the first. State radiology officials have no enforcement power to punish a clinic if it botched the first half of a procedure like Mr. Garst’s, but they can for the second half. If any radiation equipment failed to work properly, resulting in a serious injury, that must be reported to the federal Food and Drug Administration, the manufacturer and the state.  As it turned out, Mr. Garst was overdosed and seriously injured, destroying his ability to urinate and move his bowels normally. Before two external bags were attached to collect his waste, Mr. Garst’s urine leaked into his rectum because a fistula had developed. He had so many infections, his doctors had to keep trying new antibiotics to replace those that no longer worked.  “He was very, very sick from all this,” said Dr. Norbert C. Brehm, one the doctors who treated Mr. Garst after the accident. “He was not sleeping. He had a feeling of worthlessness, hopelessness, appetite disturbance, mood swings.”  And yet, until The Times began investigating Mr. Garst’s injuries, no one in government  not Texas, not the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  was even aware of his overdose or of his devastating injuries. The state and the commission initially told The Times that they had no jurisdiction in the case since neither the first nor second treatment was by itself an overdose, even though in combination they were. Despite their mandate to protect patients from radiation mistakes, the state and federal government said in essence that Mr. Garst was someone else’s problem. Had regulators investigated, they would have found reasons for concern.  The medical physicist later said he had been overworked, rarely taking a day off, and that he had complained to hospital officials about staffing issues. Mr. Garst’s radiation oncologist failed to prescribe a dosage for the implanted radioactive seeds, and the actual dose ended up being too high, according to a lawsuit filed by Mr. Garst. The physicist then failed to catch the mistake. The oncologist also implanted seeds too close to Mr. Garst’s rectum, the physicist delayed performing a post-implant analysis, and the oncologist failed to promptly report the overdose to the patient’s doctor. Mr. Garst said he did not learn of his overdose until about a year later.  In response to inquiries by The Times, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said the state had opened an investigation into Mr. Garst’s care. “They’re going to look at why the licensee didn’t report it  was there a deficiency in their procedures or training?” said James G. Luehman, a deputy director in the commission. Last week, Texas reported that its investigation had found no violations of state radiation regulations. The hospital declined to comment on the case, which has been settled.  Mr. Garst said that medically, he was at a dead end. “They couldn’t really do anything for me because I’m so burned up,” he said.  Last year, health officials in eight states sent a letter to Congress asking for a more rational way to regulate radiation. “There is no national program charged with the protection of the public from all radiation sources,” the letter stated. “Federal agencies pressure the states, most of which have comprehensive radiation programs, to provide protection from certain sources of radiation while ignoring other sources.” Kirksey Whatley, director of the Alabama Office of Radiation Control, said radioactive materials, which are overseen by the N.R.C., received most of the government’s attention, while the much more common machine-generated radiation was largely unregulated by the federal government. Thirteen states, including California, do not require that errors involving linear accelerators be reported to state health officials. Texas requires that they be reported, but has no enforcement authority to punish anyone. New York rarely fines radiotherapy units for substandard care, while Florida frequently does. Part of the problem is that hospitals may skimp on quality assurance because, depending on the state, it is voluntary, medical physicists say.  Jared W. Thompson, an Arkansas radiation official, said he mostly worried about diagnostic radiation. “There are no limits about what can be done, how it can be used, when it is considered unsafe,” Mr. Thompson said. There are no guarantees, Mr. Whatley said, that radiological devices have been inspected and that its operators are properly trained and qualified. Depending on the state, he added, “you may get two to three times more of the radiation you need.” Even when overdoses occur, some medical practitioners are reluctant to publicly disclose them. An N.R.C. advisory group underscored that point when in 2005 it recommended that the agency adopt the “industry standard” when responding to a radiation error, called a medical event, or M.E. “Keeping M.E. reports, or at least the licensee’s identity out of the public record, is probably the single most useful improvement N.R.C. could make in this regard,” the advisory committee urged. The commission rejected that recommendation.  Responding to Mistakes  Under Ohio law, Akron General Hospital was obliged to file a detailed written report no later than 15 days after it overdosed Myra Jean Garman, 76, a breast cancer patient, with high-dose radioactive seeds.  Instead, Akron General waited five months, records show. Just two months before Mrs. Garman’s accident, at the same hospital, another patient was overdosed with 111 radioactive seeds that were too powerful. When the Ohio Bureau of Radiation Protection inspected the facility, it found that the hospital’s radiation safety officer was not even aware of the accident. Nor did the hospital’s radiation safety committee discuss the overdose when it met for its regular meeting, state regulators said. Mrs. Garman’s accident occurred in September 2006, when she received twice her prescribed dose five separate times because a physicist had “entered an incorrect magnification factor into the treatment planning computer,” according to state regulators. Five months later, she complained of severe pain, and doctors discovered that she had broken ribs, a known side effect of her type of overdose. Mrs. Garman’s daughter, Joyce Lilya, said her mother, who had walked two miles daily before the procedure, could now barely walk two blocks.  Even though her cancer did not reappear, a year after the overdose, Mrs. Garman ended up in intensive care with breathing troubles. No cause could be determined, her daughter said. A month later, Mrs. Garman took an overdose of Tylenol, tied a plastic bag around her head and killed herself. “I was really trying, but it was too much for me,” she said in a note. “Let me go!!! Please.” Ms. Lilya said she and her family were stunned, calling her mother a “positive person” who would never hurt herself even though her husband had died several months earlier. Seeking reasons for her mother’s suicide, Ms. Lilya began searching the Internet and reached out with dozens of calls and e-mail messages to professional groups and government agencies. Only then, she said, did she learn of the radiation overdose. Much to her surprise, the state had cited the hospital only for failing to promptly report the mistake to state authorities. There was no fine. And while Mrs. Garman’s medical records show that she had asked for a written account of her overdose, the hospital could produce no such document nor was one in her medical file. James Gosky, a spokesman for Akron General, said in a recent interview that Mrs. Garman had been informed of her overdose.  Still, Ms. Lilya said, “none of this made any sense.” So she kept pressing  without success  for a more thorough investigation of her mother’s accident.  In a conference call last summer, she said Lance D. Himes, assistant counsel for the Ohio Department of Health, explained part of the department’s enforcement philosophy. “He told me they don’t get into assessing penalties because that is what malpractice is for,” she said.  A spokesman for the state said Mr. Himes denied making that statement. And in October 2007, the state did fine the hospital $4,000 for other infractions  but not for Mrs. Garman’s overdose.  Ms. Lilya said her investigation had taught her much about how hospitals respond when they make a mistake. “It has been a long and tragic journey for my family,” she said, And, she added, “No one was held accountable.” ",2023-10-13 19:14:12.639453+00:00,True,True,True,,0.7707246905384719,"As Technology Surges, Radiation Safeguards Lag - The New York Times","""Software Errors in Radiation Therapy Machines: Risks and Failures""","The software failure discussed in the article is related to advanced radiation therapy machines used in cancer treatment.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Thursday it would fix up to 17,600 hybrid sedans that could suffer braking problems as its largest rival, Toyota Motor Corp, grapples a reported braking problem on its market-leading Prius hybrid.

The Ford decision came the same day U.S. safety regulators opened a formal probe into consumer complaints that brakes on Toyota’s 2010 Prius had momentary problems after motorists rolled over potholes or bumps, allegedly causing four crashes.

Toyota has faced criticism for not notifying consumers about suspected problems with the brakes on its Prius right away, but Ford waited until Thursday to announce possible braking issues though it had known about them for months.

The Ford announcement came as Consumer Reports said one of its engineers ran a stop sign in a residential area when the brake pedal on a Fusion hybrid sank further than normal and warning lights lit up the dashboard. The car coasted to a stop with minimal brake feel, Consumer Reports said.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration database has a complaint from a motorist claiming that the Fusion hybrid brakes offered minimal resistance. The administration has no formal investigation into the Ford vehicles.

Ford said a software glitch on Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan hybrids built on or before October 17 could cause drivers to perceive a loss of braking as the car shifts unnecessarily from regenerative braking into the conventional mode.

Ford was not treating the matter as a full-on recall because the automaker did not see the result of the software glitch as a brake failure. Ford said on Thursday it would upgrade the software on the vehicles and expects to notify customers by mail that the fix is available at dealerships.

Consumer Reports said that with the regenerative braking disengaged, as happened in the incident near their track, the brake pedal needed to be pushed more than an inch farther down to engage the conventional brakes.

“The fact that the pedal goes away is I think for many people very disconcerting, but the fact is if you push hard you do go in to full braking,” said David Champion, director of Consumer Reports’ auto testing center.

Ford spokesman Said Deep said the automaker started to see indications of the glitch in October and had notified dealers of the possibility and a software upgrade to resolve it.

“It’s a customer satisfaction program because the car still maintains ... full conventional braking,” Deep said.

The automaker received a handful of reports about the issue and had heard reports of one minor accident, but no injuries as a result, Deep said.

In Consumer Reports’ case two weeks ago, a test engineer was driving a Fusion hybrid the influential nonprofit magazine bought last year for a review published in September when the braking incident occurred. The magazine has maintained its recommendation on the Fusion hybrid after the incident.

“Being a customer satisfaction program I think is OK in that they do have brakes if you push hard enough,” Champion said.",2023-10-13 19:32:06.953369+00:00,True,True,True,,0.8081217931857043,Ford offers fix for Fusion hybrid brake glitch - Reuters,Ford to Fix Braking Problems in Fusion and Milan Hybrids,"The software failure incident occurred with Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan hybrids built on or before October 17.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also received a complaint from a motorist claiming minimal resistance from the brakes.

Instead, they treated it as a customer satisfaction program and offered a software upgrade to resolve the issue.

Dubbed Strand-1 (Surrey Training, Research and Nanosatellite Demonstrator), the 11.8-inch satellite will take pictures of Earth on a mission to be launched later in the year. Included in its control electronics are the guts of a commercial smartphone running Android. With Strand-1, SSTL researchers want to show off the features and capabilities of a satellite while primarily using relatively inexpensive off-the-shelf components. ""The economic implications of this are really exciting,"" mission concepts engineer Shaun Kenyon told Wired.com. ""If these phones stand up to the extreme environments we see in space, it's amazing to think we could eventually leverage low-cost mobile technology to use in satellite production."" This isn't the first time scientists have launched phones aboard rockets. Last year, researchers at the NASA Ames Research Center experimented with  sending a couple of HTC Nexus One phones 30,000 feet  into the atmosphere, attaching each phone as payload in a small rocket. One phone bit the dust hard after the rocket parachute failed, but the other one walked away from its mission unscathed, capturing more than two-and-a-half hours  of recorded video  on its 720 x 480-pixel camera. Cost is a big motivation for the experiment. Many of the standard features seen in current smartphones -- cameras, GPS navigation, Wi-Fi accessibility -- are also found on satellites. But the smartphone components are a fraction of the size, weight and cost of those used in aerospace. ""We want to see if smartphones can actually survive up there, "" Kenyon said, ""and we'll be looking at how phone-specific sensors like accelerometers perform in space-flight conditions."" SSTL will initially launch the satellite powered by an on-board computer, which will judge how the phone's vitals are holding up and monitor for malfunctions in the phone's hardware. After the data on the phone's basic functioning are collected, the computer will be turned off and the phone will be used to control different parts of the satellite. SSTL won't divulge the manufacturer or model of the phone, but says it is indeed powered by the Android OS. The satellite will weigh just under 10 pounds and come equipped with  miniature reaction wheels  for general torque and orientation control, as well as GPS navigation and pulsed plasma thrusters for space propulsion. Kenyon estimates the cost of the phone parts used to come in at less than 300 pounds, or just under $500. SSTL has built and launched 34 satellites since being founded in 1981. The company specializes in smaller, low-cost satellites that often cost much less than those normally associated with space travel. In the past, the company has worked on training and development programs for NASA and the European Space Agency. The smartphone satellite project is being done in conjunction with the Surrey Space Center at the University of Surrey. SSTL hopes to launch the satellite before the end of 2011.

Hewlett-Packard replaced its embattled chief executive on Thursday with the former eBay chief executive Meg Whitman, saying that the company’s strategy to transform its business was sound, but that it needed new leadership to carry out the plan. The upheaval at H.P. came after several weeks of mounting concerns among board members, senior executives and investors about how the former chief, Léo Apotheker, had handled a major strategy shift at the company announced last month, according to interviews with several people briefed on the board’s discussions. While the board still endorses the strategy change — which includes a possible spinoff of its personal computer business, the closing of a line of mobile devices and the $11.7 billion acquisition of the software maker Autonomy — its members felt that Mr. Apotheker had bungled communicating the plans to H.P. employees and outsiders. “It’s not about the strategy, it’s about the guy,” said one of the people with knowledge of the board’s discussions, who was not authorized to speak publicly. In an interview, Ms. Whitman, who became a member of the board this year, said the process that had led to Mr. Apotheker’s ouster took place over about three months, and came to a head in late August. Once she was aware that she would be a candidate to succeed him, she said, she recused herself from the selection of a successor. Talking about why she chose to accept the role, she said, “This is a chance to help turn around an American icon,” adding that “we’ve got our hands full.” In an earlier conference call with Wall Street analysts, Ray Lane, the company’s executive chairman, was asked whether hiring Ms. Whitman had been “hasty and premature.” He replied that the board had revisited the results of the search done before hiring Mr. Apotheker, but wanted “to reach inside” H.P. Despite her brief tenure solely as a board member, he said Ms. Whitman was viewed as an insider. Image Meg Whitman called Hewlett-Packard “an American icon.” Credit... Pool photo by Jose Luis Villegas In one change from Mr. Apotheker’s plans, Ms. Whitman told investors in the conference call that H.P. would reach a decision about the fate of its PC business by the end of the year, rather than next year. She said in the interview that H.P. would remain committed to the sale of computer hardware, drawing a distinction between herself and Mr. Apotheker. “He was a software executive who thought there was a faster-growing, higher-margin business in software,” she said, but “it will not transform the company.” H.P. did not reveal any details about Mr. Apotheker’s exit package, though it is expected to in the coming days. After analyzing Mr. Apotheker’s contract, James F. Reda & Associates, a compensation consulting firm, estimated he could get as much as $38 million in total compensation, including severance, salary and other items, from his 11 months working at H.P. A hint of trouble for Mr. Apotheker surfaced two weeks ago, when Dominique Senequier, an H.P. director and chief executive of a private equity firm, notified the company that she planned to leave the board early next year, a fact disclosed in a company filing with securities regulators. The decision by Ms. Senequier, who was known to be close to Mr. Apotheker, was prompted by a concern about Mr. Apotheker’s fate at the company, according to the person familiar with the board’s discussions. Dissatisfaction with Mr. Apotheker had been building since he was named to lead the company less than a year ago, but the concerns boiled over beginning on Aug. 18, said Mr. Lane. That was when H.P. hastily announced that it was exploring a sale or spinoff of its PC business into a separate company, after portions of the news became public earlier in the day, and disappointing quarterly earnings. The changes caught many H.P. executives off-guard; Todd Bradley, the executive in charge of its PC business, received less than 24 hours’ notice, according to a person close to Mr. Bradley. Image Dominique Senequier said she would leave the board. Credit... Mal Langsdon/Reuters The uncertainty about the future of the PC business also created uneasiness among the company’s big corporate customers, causing concern among H.P.’s board that it could contribute to weakness in its PC sales. Executives at H.P. were also upset about the way Mr. Apotheker announced plans to discontinue smartphones and tablet computers that use an operating system, WebOS, which H.P. acquired last year through its $1.2 billion purchase of Palm Inc. H.P. said it was shelving the products after they failed to sell well. But many executives felt that H.P.’s announcement left in doubt the future of WebOS, which many supporters inside the company say still had enormous value — for instance, as software that could be licensed to other device manufacturers, said the person knowledgeable about the board’s discussions. H.P. was later forced to clarify that it wanted to keep the software alive by partnering with other hardware companies. “It was botched in a big, big way,” M. Eric Johnson, a professor at Dartmouth College’s Tuck School of Business, said of H.P.’s announcement of its strategy change last month. “It came out in dribs and drabs in a very confusing set of announcements.” The atmosphere in the executive ranks at H.P. beneath Mr. Apotheker became increasingly tense over the past several weeks. “They were demoralized and confused,” said one former H.P. executive who stays in contact with colleagues still at the company. “They felt there was no process matching the vision, no structure for execution.” H.P.’s board was becoming more unsettled by Mr. Apotheker’s communications with investors, including bullish statements about H.P.’s prospects that turned out to be embarrassing in hindsight. At an investor conference in the spring put on by Sanford C. Bernstein, the investment firm’s analyst Toni Sacconaghi asked Mr. Apotheker how confident, on a scale of one to 10, he was that H.P. would earn $7 a share during fiscal 2014. Mr. Apotheker’s described his confidence level as an 11, according to Mr. Sacconaghi. But when H.P. announced its strategy shift in mid-August, the company said weakness in its business would force it to withdraw its 2014 financial forecast, without providing a new estimate of how much it expected to earn that year.",2023-10-17 09:44:27.381230+00:00,True,False,,,,Meg Whitman Is Named Hewlett-Packard Chief - The New York Times,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

'Next to zero chance' of getting caught: Boasts of 'Anonymous' computer hackers who brought down Mastercard and Paypal in Wikileaks protest



PayPal lost £3.5million after site was taken offline by 'Anonymous' gang

Three hackers admit guilt over 2010 attack, while 22-year-old hacker known as 'Nerdo' denies charge of conspiracy

Gang 'considered targeting pop star Lily Allen's website '

A computer hacking gang, who caused major companies multi-million pound losses, boasted there was 'next to zero' chance they would be caught, a court heard.



The group, taking action on behalf of the 'Anonymous' protest group, brought down websites belonging to PayPal and Mastercard by flooding them with messages and requests under the banner 'Operation Payback'.

The gang even discussed hacking pop star Lily Allen's website in revenge for her stance on anti-piracy, Southwark Crown Court heard.

Northampton University student Christopher Weatherhead, 22, who used the online handle 'Nerdo', is on trial accused of playing an 'integral role' in the attacks.

Ashley Rhodes, 28, Peter Gibson, 24, and an 18-year-old who cannot be named, have already admitted their roles in the conspiracy.

Anonymous attack: Ashley Rhodes (left), 26, has pleaded guilty to one conspiracy charge, while Christopher Weatherhead, 21, (right) is pleading not guilty

Pleading guilty: Peter Gibson, 23, appearing in court

Prosecutor Sandip Patel said online forums contained instruction manuals for Anonymous supporters to join 2010 attacks and evade capture.

'One user asked what would happen if they got caught', he told jurors.

'It says the chances are next to zero because so many are doing it. You simply deny knowing what they are talking about, or say you have been infected by a virus.

'If you try to do this alone, the chances are much higher you will get caught.'

The campaign originally targeted music industry bodies to avenge their anti-piracy stance, but the gang began to focus on firms who refused to process payments to Julian Assange's Wikileaks organisation.

The online payments firm PayPal suffered losses of £3.5million, while sites belonging to Mastercard and recording industry bodies were also forced offline.

Weatherhead is accused of bragging online to a fellow hacker: 'We have probably done some million pound of damage to mc [Mastercard]'.

Anyone who tried to visit the sites was directed to a webpage displaying the message: 'You've tried to bite the Anonymous hand. You angered the hive and now you are being stung'.

Anonymous held an online countdown to the start of co-ordinated attacks, telling their followers: 'Charging your lasers, remember don't start shooting until the time.'

Investigator DC Trevor Dickey said police found several 'press releases' from the hackers attempting to explain their actions.

'They had what I referred to as press releases, where they sought to justify why it is they do the things that they do', he said.



He added: 'It was to cause as much disruption to whether it be an organisation or company which had a website.

'They tried to take them offline so they couldn't function as an entity.'



Jurors heard Weatherhead was an administrator of Anonymous sites which urged followers to carry out distributed denial of services attacks (DDoS) against the companies.

DDoS attacks work by paralysing a computer system by flooding it with an 'intolerable number of online requests and messages', the court heard.

The hackers sent 'DDOS' attacks to site such as PayPal - which prevented customers making transactions

MasterCard websites were also taken offline, the court heard

Weatherhead and his three co-conspirators are said to be a 'small cabal of leaders' for attacks between September 2010 and January 2011.

'Press releases' posted by Anonymous were played to jurors in which the group begged the public not to be angry with their actions.

'Please do not despise use', it said. 'We ask you to consider the value of freed of information for you and future generations.



'We ask you to consider the implications of information censorship through the Internet or free speech.

'Consider the future of our human rights. Those you want to take these rights from you will not stop with this.'

The group promised to continue 'until our proverbial dying breath' to tackle what it described as 'atrocities' committed by large firms against free speech.

Among its instructions to supporters was to distribute the controversial Wikileaks cables across the Internet so that more people could read them.

Weatherhead denies one count of conspiracy to impair the operation of computers between August 1, 2010 and January 27 last year.

Rhodes, from Camberwell, southeast London, Gibson, from Hartlepool, and the 18-year-old, of Chester, have pleaded guilty to the same charge.",2023-10-18 01:12:39.615000+00:00,True,True,True,,0.7838472589965833,Boasts of 'Anonymous' computer hackers who brought down Mastercard and Paypal in Wikileaks protest - Daily Mail,'Anonymous' Hackers Bring Down Mastercard and Paypal in Protest,"The software failure occurred in 2010 and targeted websites belonging to PayPal and Mastercard.

16336,https://www.cnet.com/reviews/aperion-aris-review/,2013-01-31 08:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnet.com,,"Published on None. At its announcement in May 2012, the Aperion Aris was billed as the world's first wireless speaker for Windows. While there are dozens of Apple AirPlay speakers, and even an Android speaker or two, why has no one thought to make a Windows one? Apart from sounding unfashionable, play with the Aperion Aris for 5 minutes and you'll find out why.

The Good The <b>Aperion Aris</b> has excellent sound quality for a streaming speaker, and decent stereo separation. The speaker has a very intimate sound and is best suited to ensemble music or folk. Build quality is very good. The promise of an AirPlay option is a big plus. The Bad The speaker's reliance on buggy Windows software is a problem, and for best performance you'll need to use the 3.5mm input. The Aris isn't as well-suited to background listening, losing some scale off-axis, and it isn't as accomplished when playing complex music like progressive rock or stirring classical. The price is a little high. The Bottom Line The Aperion Aris is a high-performance streaming speaker with an intimate sound, but its reliance on Windows streaming is a low note.

The problems with the Aperion aren't exactly the fault of the speaker, as Windows' Play To feature is fairly unreliable, but it does make us pine for the Apple AirPlay option that's due for the Aris this spring. Sound quality is fairly good for a device of this type, and it can go plenty loud. If only it weren't so expensive.

Design and features

The chassis of the Aris is pretty distinctive, constructed from a single piece of brushed aluminum and sitting atop a red steel stand. The thin stand is removable if you don't like the look and the bottom of the unit has a rubberized surface you can use instead. On top you'll find volume controls and power; there is no remote.

The Aris features a total of six drivers -- two tweeters, two woofers, and two passive, rear-facing radiators -- and boasts an amplifier with a total power output of 100W (likely 50W per channel). While it lacks an EQ circuit it does come with three different sound modes: Natural, Bass Boost, and Enhanced Stereo.

At the rear of the unit you'll find a PC Card-like expansion port and a 3.5mm input. Included in the box is a compatible adapter that adds wireless connectivity (with WPS) and an Ethernet jack.

The manufacturer anticipates that the main use of this speaker will involve Windows Media Player's Play To feature, as used in Windows 7 and 8. Right-click on a file in Windows Media Player and choose Play To -> Aperion Aris and the sound will (theoretically) appear out of the Aris. The box is also DLNA-compatible, so you aren't limited to Windows, and there are numerous apps, including the official Aris app, available for iOS, Android, and Mac.

The Aris comes with a wireless card. Sarah Tew/CNET

The Aris Control app is available for iOS and Android and is designed to be used specifically with the Aris. Unfortunately, it didn't work as well as even Windows' Play To function (about which more shortly) and either refused to recognize the Aris player or failed to offer up a usable library from within my Android phone.

Performance

In the three years since Windows 7's Play To debuted with promises of effortless streaming, I can say there is not a day that I've found it could fulfill them. I've used a dozen different configurations of networks, PCs, and playback devices, and Play To has consistently proved buggy.

Compared with Sonos' system, Apple AirPlay, or even other implementations of DLNA, Windows Media Player didn't satisfy. It either couldn't find the player or the stream would stop and start more frequently than an NFL match. I was hopeful Microsoft had fixed the problems with Windows 8, but no, playing to the Aperion would stop after 30 seconds or simply say Device Disconnected and require a reboot.

Though I did get the feature to work for about half an hour at one stage, I found a simple, yet self-defeating way to fix this problem: use the 3.5mm jack. One thing to note is streaming to the unit won't work while something is plugged into 3.5mm port -- Windows will tell you it's playing but there will be no sound. I had some success with the usually reliable Media:Connect app for iOS, but at one point even it stalled.

But whichever way you can find that works for you, there is no dismissing the sound; it makes products like the Libratone Zipp, though good, seem like toys in comparison. This is one of the most hi-fi ""wi-fis"" you will find for the price.

Of the three sound settings, it was a toss-up between the Bass Boost option and Natural. For rock music, Bass Boost was best and Natural seemed too thin while enhanced stereo sounded like it was being transmitted from out of a satellite dish with a sunken middle and exaggerated left and right. In Natural mode, the Aris had an intimate, detailed sound that was better suited to music from singer-songwriters or small ensembles.

Though the speaker is barely 15 inches across, it has one of the strongest stereo images of a speaker of this kind. We're not talking opera house spaciousness here, but voices sounded like they were coming out of the center of the speaker with a definite left and right channel audible from about 8 feet away. This is something you can't say of the Bowers & Wilkins Zeppelin Air, where all of the sound comes from over there...somewhere. The Aris provides more air around the instruments and voices and greater focus while the Zeppelin seems like it's throwing its voice: it doesn't draw you in the way the Aris does.

The Zeppelin's strength though is that it's designed to be listened to in the background and so from anywhere in the room, whereas move off-axis to the Aris and the sound closes in on itself, losing scale and immediacy.

Try something a little more complicated on the Aris though and it will try its best to keep up, for a while. The thud of John Stanier's toms at the beginning of Battles' ""Atlas"" were every bit the equal of the bass-heavy Zeppelin with plenty of punch, but once the other instruments piled in on top the bass response disappeared and the speaker instead tried to focus on the higher pitches of the ""vocals."" If you want something more consistent you should opt for a set of powered speakers such as the Audioengine 5+ speakers, which will give you an even greater stereo spread -- the drums come out of the left speaker in this instance -- and better bass response when things get busy.

Further dense music such as ""Wasted Days"" by Cloud Nothings sounded constrained when played though the Aris, and only when the bass and drums were playing together did it sound more convincing.

Conclusion

While we all wait for an official AirPlay module for the Aperion Aris, I'll have to say the Aris has the musical chops but is let down by its choice of instrument. However, it is one of the only wireless speakers you could even begin to pretend is an actual hi-fi system, and it is built to last. Its reliance on Windows is a sore point, and having to resort to a 3.5mm input defeats the purpose of buying this type of speaker in the first place. If the Airs were AirPlay-compatible by default, as well as DLNA-compatible, and could (magically) keep the same price, it would be a much more recommendable product.",2023-10-19 00:40:13.930057+00:00,True,True,False,,,Aperion Aris review: Not yet a stream come true - CNET,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a dramatic announcement late Wednesday, the  New York Times  reported that hackers from China had been routing through the paper's network for at least four months, stealing the passwords of reporters in an apparent attempt to identify sources and gather other intelligence about stories related to the family of China's prime minister. The hackers breached the network sometime around Sept. 13 and  stole the corporate passwords for every  Times  employee , using them to gain access to the personal computers of 53 employees, according to the report. The hacking coincided with an investigation the  Times  published last October that looked into a fortune that the family of China's Prime Minister Wen Jiabao had amassed. The hackers breached the network while the paper was in the process of concluding its reporting for the investigation. The hackers broke into the email account of the newspaper's Shanghai bureau chief, David Barboza, who conducted the investigation, as well as the email account of Jim Yardley, the paper's South Asia bureau chief in India, who had previously worked out of Beijing. Executive Editor Jill Abramson said, however, that forensic experts with Mandiant, the computer security firm hired to investigate the breach, found ""no evidence that sensitive e-mails or files from the reporting of our articles about the Wen family were accessed, downloaded or copied."" It's not the first time that the paper has been hacked. In 1998, a group known as HFG -- or H4acking for Girl13z -- hacked the paper's web site to protest the arrest of hacker Kevin Mitnick and accuse  Times  reporter John Markoff of helping to catch him. In 2002, former hacker Adrian Lamo, famously  hacked the paper's network  after discovering multiple vulnerabilities and accessed a database containing the details of 3,000 contributors to the paper's op-ed page, among other things. In 2011, former executive editor of the  Times , Bill Keller, hinted that WikiLeaks or someone associated with the group had hacked into the accounts of some of the paper's staff. During a period of heightened tension between WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and the paper, which was then a publishing partner of WikiLeaks, the e-mail accounts of at least three people at the  Times  were apparently hacked. Keller suggested that Assange and WikiLeaks were behind the intrusions but never offered evidence to support this. In the latest hack, the attackers, in an attempt to hide their tracks, routed their attacks through computers that they hacked at universities in North Carolina, Arizona, Wisconsin and New Mexico, as well as at small companies and internet service providers. They apparently used the same university computers that hackers working for the Chinese military used previously to attack Defense Department contractors. During the three months they were in the paper's network, the attackers installed 45 pieces of custom malware, though nearly all of it went undetected. Although the newspaper uses antivirus products made by Symantec, the monitoring software identified and quarantined only one of the attacker's tools during that time, according to the report. The attackers increased their activity in late October after the paper published its investigation of the prime minister's relatives, and were also particularly active the night of the Nov. 6 presidential election. The paper noted that there were concerns the hackers would try to shut down its publishing system that night, but they turned out to be unwarranted since the attackers apparently showed interest only in the paper's reporting about the prime minister's family. “They could have wreaked havoc on our systems,” said Marc Frons, the Times’s chief information officer said in the report. “But that was not what they were after.” The  Times  had been on alert for suspicious activity after learning that Chinese officials had warned that the paper's reporting would have consequences. The paper asked AT&T, which monitors its network, to be on the lookout for suspicious activity. After AT&T reported finding such activity, the FBI was notified, and the  Times  called in Mandiant to investigate. Evidence showed that the hackers installed three backdoors and routed their way through the network for two weeks before uncovering a system containing the computer usernames and hashed passwords for all of the paper's employees. The hackers apparently cracked a number of passwords to gain entry to employee computers. ""They created custom software that allowed them to search for and grab Mr. Barboza’s and Mr. Yardley’s e-mails and documents from a Times e-mail server,"" the paper revealed. The intrusion is apparently part of a wider campaign directed by Chinese hackers against western media outlets since 2008. Hackers from China also attempted to hack into the network of  Bloomberg News  last year after publishing stories about the relatives of China's vice president. Mandiant has investigated many of the breaches and found evidence that Chinese hackers had stolen e-mails, contact lists and files from more than 30 journalists and executives working for western media outlets.",2023-10-19 00:41:38.597221+00:00,True,True,True,,0.8731547477068227,"New York Times Hacked Again, This Time Allegedly by Chinese - WIRED",Chinese Hackers Breach New York Times Network and Steal Passwords,"The software failure occurred when hackers from China breached the network of the New York Times.

Google Glass, the wearable computer being developed by the search giant, might be a threat to its owners' privacy because it has no PIN or authentication system, hackers have discovered.

Jay Freeman, a Santa Barbara-based programmer who specialises in cracking smartphone security for both iPhone and Android devices, discovered that Glass has a ""root"" capability which can be enabled by attaching it to a desktop computer and running some commands.

That would then give a hacker the ability to take control of the Glass's output – meaning a hacker could monitor everything the owner was doing from a smartphone in their pocket.

""Once the attacker has root on your Glass, they have much more power than if they had access to your phone or even your computer: they have control over a camera and a microphone that are attached to your head,"" explains Freeman in a blogpost. ""A bugged Glass doesn't just watch your every move: it watches everything you are looking at (intentionally or furtively) and hears everything you do. The only thing it doesn't know are your thoughts.""

He points out that ""it knows all your passwords, for example, as it can watch you type them. It even manages to monitor your usage of otherwise safe, old-fashioned technology: it watches you enter door codes, it takes pictures of your keys, and it records what you write using a pen and paper. Nothing is safe once your Glass has been hacked."" Even if the device shows a red light to show others when its video camera is on, a user probably wouldn't notice it – because the light would be facing away from them.

Freeman reckons that about 10 minutes would be enough for a hacker to install a ""rooted"" version of the software that Glass ships with. ""Sadly, due to the way Glass is currently designed, it is particularly susceptible to the kinds of security issues that tend to plague Android devices,"" he writes.

""The one saving grace of Android's track record on security is that most of the bugs people find in it cannot be exploited while the device is PIN-code locked. Google's Glass, however, does not have any kind of PIN mechanism: when you turn it on, it is immediately usable.""

Freeman got hold of one of the demonstration units of Glass, and quickly found that there is a ""Debug Mode"" which lets it connect to computers over a USB connection. That in turn lets anyone who has access to the device to install their own software if they use certain technical tricks.

He recommends that Glass should have a protection system that functions when it is taken off by the owner, such as a biometric – either using patterns in the iris or voice – or a PIN.

And for the privacy concerns, both that users have expressed and that Freeman has now opened up, he suggests there would at least be a simple one over worries about the camera: a plastic shield that could slide over the camera. ""This makes it clear that 'I'm not recording right now',"" he suggests.

A Google spokesperson said: ""We recognize the importance of building device-specific protections, and we're experimenting with solutions as we work to make Glass more broadly available.""

Sources who know about Google's thinking on the project say that the ""Explorer"" program is aimed at developers rather than the average consumer, and that it doesn't access all of a user's account details. There is also a ""remote wipe"" system in the Explorer system, though it's unclear whether it would work against a hacked device.",2023-10-19 03:43:39.064373+00:00,True,True,True,,0.7877985889173548,Google Glass security failings may threaten owner's privacy - The Guardian,Google Glass: Lack of PIN or Authentication System Allows Hacking,"The software failure occurred with Google Glass, a wearable computer developed by Google. The failure was discovered by Jay Freeman, a programmer specializing in smartphone security. The failure occurred because Glass does not have a PIN or authentication system, making it vulnerable to hacking. By attaching Glass to a desktop computer and running certain commands, a hacker can enable the ""root"" capability of Glass, giving them control over the device's output. This means that a hacker could monitor everything the owner is doing from a smartphone in their pocket. The impact of this failure is a significant threat to the privacy of Glass owners, as the hacker would have control over the device's camera and microphone. The hacker would be able to watch and listen to everything the owner does, including capturing passwords, monitoring usage of door codes, taking pictures of keys, and recording written information. The responsible entity for this failure is Google, as they developed and released Glass without a PIN or authentication system.

21611,https://www.wired.com/2013/09/freedom-hosting-fbi/,2013-09-13 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.wired.com,,"Published on 2013-09-13 20:17:12+00:00.  It wasn't ever  seriously in doubt, but the FBI yesterday acknowledged that it secretly took control of Freedom Hosting last July, days before the servers of the largest provider of ultra-anonymous hosting were found to be serving custom malware designed to identify visitors. Freedom Hosting's operator, Eric Eoin Marques, had rented the servers from an unnamed commercial hosting provider in France, and paid for them from a bank account in Las Vegas. It's not clear how the FBI took over the servers in late July, but the bureau was temporarily thwarted when Marques somehow regained access and changed the passwords, briefly locking out the FBI until it gained back control. The new details emerged in  local  press  reports  from a Thursday bail hearing in Dublin, Ireland, where Marques, 28, is fighting extradition to America on charges that Freedom Hosting facilitated child pornography on a massive scale. He was denied bail today for the second time since his arrest in July. Freedom Hosting was a provider of turnkey “Tor hidden service” sites — special sites, with addresses ending in .onion, that hide their geographic location behind layers of routing, and can be reached only over the Tor anonymity network. Tor hidden services are used by sites that need to evade surveillance or protect users' privacy to an extraordinary degree – including human rights groups and journalists. But they also appeal to serious criminal elements, child-pornography traders among them. On August 4, all the sites hosted by Freedom Hosting -- some with no connection to child porn -- began serving an error message with hidden code embedded in the page.  Security researchers dissected the code  and found it exploited a security hole in Firefox to identify users of the Tor Browser Bundle, reporting back to a mysterious server in Northern Virginia. The FBI was the obvious suspect, but declined to comment on the incident. The FBI also didn't respond to inquiries from WIRED today. But FBI Supervisory Special Agent J. Brooke Donahue was more forthcoming when he appeared in the Irish court yesterday to bolster the case for keeping Marques behind bars, according to local press reports. Among the many arguments Donahue and an Irish police inspector offered was that Marques might reestablish contact with co-conspirators, and further complicate the FBI probe. In addition to the wrestling match over Freedom Hosting's servers, Marques allegedly dove for his laptop when the police raided him, in an effort to shut it down. Donahue also said Marques had been researching the possibility of moving his hosting, and his residence, to Russia. ""My suspicion is he was trying to look for a place to reside to make it the most difficult to be extradited to the U.S.,"" said Donahue, according to the  Irish Independent . Freedom Hosting has long been notorious for allowing child porn to live on its servers. In 2011, the hactivist collective Anonymous singled out the service for denial-of-service attacks after allegedly finding the firm hosted 95 percent of the child porn hidden services on the Tor network. In the hearing yesterday, Donahue said the service hosted at least 100 child porn sites with thousands of users, and claimed Marques had visited some of the sites himself. Reached by phone, Marques' lawyer declined to comment on the case. Marques faces federal charges in Maryland, where the FBI's child-exploitation unit is based, in a case that is still under seal. The apparent FBI-malware attack was first noticed on August 4, when all of the hidden service sites hosted by Freedom Hosting began displaying a “Down for Maintenance” message. That included at least some lawful websites, such as the secure email provider TorMail. Some visitors looking at the source code of the maintenance page realized that it included a hidden  iframe  tag that loaded a mysterious clump of Javascript code from a Verizon Business internet address. By midday, the code was being circulated and dissected all over the net. Mozilla confirmed the code exploited a critical memory management vulnerability in Firefox that was  publicly reported  on June 25, and is fixed in the latest version of the browser. Though many older revisions of Firefox were vulnerable to that bug, the malware only targeted Firefox 17 ESR, the version of Firefox that forms the basis of the Tor Browser Bundle – the easiest, most user-friendly package for using the Tor anonymity network. That made it clear early on that the attack was focused specifically on de-anonymizing Tor users. Tor Browser Bundle users who installed or manually updated after June 26 were safe from the exploit, according to the Tor Project's  security advisory  on the hack. The payload for the Tor Browser Bundle malware is hidden in a variable called ""magneto."" Perhaps the strongest evidence that the attack was a law enforcement or intelligence operation was the limited functionality of the malware. The heart of the malicious Javascript was a tiny Windows executable hidden in a variable named “Magneto.” A traditional virus would use that executable to download and install a full-featured backdoor, so the hacker could come in later and steal passwords, enlist the computer in a DDoS botnet, and generally do all the other nasty things that happen to a hacked Windows box. But the Magneto code didn't download anything. It looked up the victim’s MAC address -- a unique hardware identifier for the computer’s network or Wi-Fi card -- and the victim's Windows hostname. Then it sent it to a server in Northern Virginia server, bypassing Tor, to expose the user's real IP address, coding the transmission as a standard HTTP web request. “The attackers spent a reasonable amount of time writing a reliable exploit, and a fairly customized payload, and it doesn’t allow them to download a backdoor or conduct any secondary activity,""  said Vlad Tsyrklevich, who reverse-engineered the Magneto code , at the time. The malware also sent a serial number that likely ties the target to his or her visit to the hacked Freedom Hosting-hosted website. The official IP allocation records maintained by the  American Registry for Internet Numbers  show the two Magneto-related IP addresses were part of a ghost block of eight addresses that have no organization listed. Those addresses trace no further than the Verizon Business data center in Ashburn, Virginia, 20 miles northwest of the Capital Beltway. The code's behavior, and the command-and-control server's Virginia placement, is also consistent with what's known about the FBI’s ""computer and internet protocol address verifier,"" or CIPAV, the law enforcement spyware first  reported  by WIRED in 2007. Court documents and FBI files released under the FOIA have described the CIPAV as software the FBI can deliver through a browser exploit to gather information from the target’s machine and send it to an FBI server in Virginia. The FBI has  been using the CIPAV  since 2002 against hackers, online sexual predators, extortionists, and others, primarily to identify suspects who are disguising their location using proxy servers or anonymity services, like Tor. Prior to the Freedom Hosting attack, the code had been used sparingly, which kept it from leaking out and being analyzed. No date has been set for Marques' extradition hearings, but it's not expected to happen until next year.",2023-10-19 09:56:14.792696+00:00,True,True,False,,,FBI Admits It Controlled Tor Servers Behind Mass Malware Attack - WIRED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

21 noviembre 2013 Actualizado 23 noviembre 2013

Pie de foto, ¿A quién no le ha pasado estar viendo algo importante, pagando o esperando algo y el sistema se cae?

En la pantalla, un mensaje: el temido Error 404.

Frustrante para todos, en cualquier momento. Pero, si resulta que la computadora no es la suya, sino la de un banco, el problema pasa a mayores.

Tanto grandes empresas como nosotros quedamos expuestos a problemas potencialmente catastróficos cuando estos sufren fallos en los sistemas informáticos. Tratos comerciales que tienen que ser abortados, personal que no recibe su sueldo o facturas que no se pagan a tiempo.

Sin embargo, estos errores están lejos de ser inusuales.

Muchos bancos tienen problemas frecuentes con sus sistemas, lo que deja a sus clientes a la deriva y a su personal de informática luchando por detectar y solucionar el problema.

Por supuesto, no son sólo los bancos los que sufren fallos tecnológicos. A veces le ocurre a organizaciones de las que la mayoría de la gente nunca ha oído hablar, pero que sin embargo, genera un efecto dominó sobre otras empresas e individuos.

Por ejemplo, en pleno apogeo del verano, el sistema de reserva de vuelos Sabre, utilizado por más de 300 compañías aéreas, falló durante varias horas, lo que resultó en cancelación de vuelos y retrasos. Y el personal de algunas aerolíneas debió recurrir a los tradicionales papel y lápiz para chequear a los pasajeros de forma manual.

Pero, ¿por qué se caen con tanta frecuencia estos importantes sistemas? De hecho, ¿por qué se caen?

""Equilibrio rentabilidad-riesgo""

A menudo, la culpa la tiene el dinero: la eliminación de los errores de software y otras debilidades del sistema es cara.

""La cantidad de dinero que están dispuestos a gastar se basa en el riesgo relativo de lo que pasa si no lo hacen"", explica Simon Acott, director de la empresa de servicios de tecnologías de la información exponencial-e en un evento reciente.

""Hay que encontrar el equilibrio entre el riesgo y el beneficio"".

Este tipo de economía ""caza-errores"" es también la razón de que los software relativamente baratos sean propensos a bloquear o colapsar los computadores en los que se instalan.

Sin duda, hacer programas de computador más confiables sería posible, pero los desarrolladores tendrían que invertir mucho más tiempo y dinero, lo que implicaría que el precio del producto sería inaceptablemente alto.

El resultado es que las empresas terminan produciendo software lo ""suficientemente fiable"" y que se pueden vender a un precio apropiado para el mercado masivo.

""Sin pruebas suficientes""

Pie de foto, Muchos bancos cuentan con tecnología obsoleta, porque no actualizan los softwares.

Pero, ¿qué pasa con los sistemas utilizados por los bancos y otras grandes empresas, en los que millones de clientes confían? ¿No vale la pena que estas organizaciones inviertan cantidades sustanciales para asegurar que la tecnología que usan no sea defectuosa?

""Voy a decir algo polémico: las fallas con los sistemas informáticos rara vez tienen que ver con la tecnología"", dice Damian Saunders, director de la compañía de software Citrix Systems, basada en Florida.

""Normalmente, la tecnología juega un papel en las fallas, pero cuando reviso la raíz del asunto, las causas predominante son las personas y los procesos"".

¿Qué quiere decir esto? En algunos casos puede ser tan simple como que el personal no se apega a las normas establecidas para probar un nuevo software antes de que salga al mercado.

Las organizaciones pueden tener una política planificada que implica probar diez veces un software, pero queda en nada si el personal no la sigue.

""Si hacen nueve pruebas de las diez y luego dicen: 'Hemos hecho nueve, la décima saldrá bien', entonces pueden tener problemas"", dice Andrew Marks, jefe del departamento de información de Tullow Oil, una compañía de exploración de petróleo y gas basada en Londres. ""A menudo la décima prueba es la que falla"".

""Tecnología obsoleta""

En lo que respecta a los bancos, sin embargo, hay una razón más fundamental por la cual los sistemas de computador son propensos al fracaso.

""Los bancos son viejos y la tecnología que utilizan es vieja. Y hay cada vez menos gente alrededor que sabe cómo hacerla funcionar"", dice un gerente de desarrollo de tecnologías de la información de una importante empresa de préstamos en Londres quien habló con la BBC bajo condición de anonimato.

En muchos casos, los bancos están utilizando versiones desactualizadas de software en lugar de versiones más recientes, porque no saben qué efecto puede tener una actualización en los otros sistemas con los que interactúa, explica el gerente.

""20% de los sistemas que se ejecutan en nuestro banco usan tecnología obsoleta, que ya no es compatible con el proveedor. No se puede culpar al software por la falla, porque en muchos casos si lo hubiéramos actualizado, no habría fallado"".

Pie de foto, Externalizar es para algunos una solución y, para otros, un problema.

Ante la alternativa de actualizar estos sistemas -con todo el riesgo y el costo que ello implica- o dejarlos como están, muchos bancos optan por externalizar su gestión a terceras empresas y lavarse las manos, dice.

Pero es aún más difícil para las empresas contratadas mantener la confiabilidad de los sistemas.

""Cuando usted externaliza, pierde el conocimiento específico sobre la materia, lo que implica dedicar tres o cuatro veces más personal para mantener los sistemas en funcionamiento. Y en algunos casos, no tienen ni idea de lo que hace realmente el software del que están encargados, porque ya nadie se acuerda"".

El resultado es un gran equipo de personal que debe ser organizado y más gente con acceso al código del software.

""Esto puede tener enormes consecuencias negativas en términos de fiabilidad"", señala el gerente.

Proyecto de Reequilibrio

Pero Kerry Hallard , director ejecutivo de la Asociación Nacional de Outsourcing, rechaza la idea de que la tercerización tenga parte de la culpa de los fallos del sistema bancario.

""En general la externalización aumenta las capacidades, no las disminuye"", asegura.

""Si se han contratado los servicios de terceros y se necesita más gente, hay algo mal"".

Sin embargo, el gerente de desarrollo mencionado anteriormente cree que la mejor forma de hacer los sistemas bancarios más fiables es desarrollar y mantener más capacidades dentro de los propios bancos para que los sistemas puedan ser modernizados.",2023-10-19 14:15:31.842056+00:00,True,True,False,,,Error 404: aquí para quedarse - BBC.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The hacking group announced the exploit on Friday, showing several screenshots of the Wordpress-based backend of the Forbes.com Web site. The organization said in a tweet that more than 1 million user e-mails and passwords were successfully stolen and will be published at some point.

Forbes acknowledged that its Web site and publishing platform were the targets of a hack in a Facebook post on Friday. The company said e-mail addresses may have been exposed but passwords are encrypted. Still, Forbes cautioned readers and contributors to change their passwords as a precaution:

The passwords were encrypted, but as a precaution, we strongly encourage Forbes readers and contributors to change their passwords on our system, and encourage them to change them on other websites if they use the same password elsewhere. We have notified law enforcement. We take this matter very seriously and apologize to the members of our community for this breach.

IBTimes, which earlier reported on the story, talked to a spokesperson for the SEA, who said the attacks are based in its belief that Forbes' ""hate for Syria is very clear and flagrant in their articles.""

In addition to stealing usernames, the Syrian Electronic Army posted an article on the site entitled ""Hacked by the Syrian Electronic Army."" That article has since been taken down, and there don't appear to be any other posts on the site that have come from the Syrian Electronic Army.

The Syrian Electronic Army is one of the more active hacking groups.

There’s no escape from those embarrassing snaps now: Facebook reveals algorithm that can recognise faces almost as well as a human

DeepFace was trained by analysing pictures uploaded to Facebook

Can 'spin' a head to get a clear look at the face using 3D modelling



Facebook has created an algorithm that can pick a face out of a crowd almost as accurately as a human.

Called DeepFace, it uses technology the firm bought when it acquired Israeli startup face.com last year.

Its creators say it pick a face out of a crowd with 97.25 per cent accuracy.

Facebook's DeepFace uses a 3-D model to rotate faces, virtually, so that they face the camera. Image (a) shows the original image, and (g) shows the final, corrected version which the software can then attempt to recognise.

Yaniv Taigman and colleagues at Facebook's AI lab found a way to build a 3D model of a face from a photo that can be rotated into the best position for the algorithm to start matching.



They then used a neural network that had been trained on a massive database of faces to try and match the face with one in a test database of more than 4 million images, containing more than 4000 separate identities, each one labelled by humans.

'We revisit both the alignment step and the representation step by employing explicit 3D face modeling in order to apply a piecewise affine transformation, and derive a face representation from a nine-layer deep neural network,' the team wrote.

The system can now identify faces at virtually the same level of accuracy as a human

The team achieved 97.25 per cent accuracy on the test data that contained more than 13,000 images of faces collected from the web.



A test using real people recruited on Amazon's Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing site managed 97.5 per cent.



Details will be presented at the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition conference in Columbus, Ohio, in June.



Experts say Facebook could use it to identify all of a user's real friends are.

'They could identify every one of your friends in all of your photos,' Christopher Kanan of the California Institute of Technology told New Scientist.

Beware of online banking: Security expert reveals that ANYONE can hack a bank's app using free internet tools



Mobile security expert has demonstrated how a banking app can be hacked

He built a dummy app and used reverse engineering to connect to a server

When sending money, the server was able to obtain the user’s password

It was then programmed to piggyback onto the payment and transfer money to the hacker’s account

Arxan’s Winston Bond said reverse engineering can be used on any app



There are also tools and online tutorials to teach hackers the process

Mobile security experts set up a dummy banking app, pictured, to demonstrate how the technology can be hacked using reverse engineering

More than two thirds of us now use smartphones to make payments and check bank balances online.

Many banking apps have a number of security measures in place - from two-step authentication to passwords and PINs - but they may not be as secure as first thought.

A mobile security expert has revealed to MailOnline how these apps can be hijacked using free tools available online - and the hackers don’t need any of the user's login details.

Winston Bond is technical manager at mobile security firm Arxan Technologies.

To highlight the risks, he developed a dummy banking app before engineering it to connect it to an external server that could be run by a hacker.

During a demonstration, as he signed into the app, the password was automatically revealed on the hacker’s server.

During another demo, he sent money via the app.



The server was able to piggyback onto the payment and even transfer money to the hacker’s account at the same time.

Although this was a dummy demonstration, Bond explained it is the same process hackers are using to access official banking apps on mobile devices.

The hacking technique used is called reverse engineering.



The process involves taking an object apart to see how it works, either to replicate or improve it.



As part of the engineering, expert Winston Bond connected the app to an external server that could be run by a hacker, pictured. During one demonstration, as he signed into the app on his iPad, the password was automatically revealed on this pretend hacker's server on a laptop, pictured

During another demonstration, Bond sent money to a person called Mark, via the app. The server was able to piggyback onto the payment and send money to the hacker's account, pictured here as A.Crook. Although this was a dummy demonstration, Bond said it is the same process hackers use to access official banking apps

WHAT IS REVERSE ENGINEERING?

Reverse engineering is the process of taking an object apart to see how it works, either to replicate or improve the object. It is not just used for hacking purposes, and is often used by programmers to find mistakes or errors in code in order to fix them. In the case of apps, software reverse engineering involves translating a program's binary code back into the source code that it was written in. This source code reveals to the hackers how the app works, the steps it takes to complete certain tasks and details about the app’s structure. A reverse engineer can use a various tools to disassemble a program. One example is called a hexadecimal dumper, which prints or displays the binary numbers of a program in hexadecimal format, making it easier to read than binary. Another tool is a disassembler. This reads the binary code and displays each instruction in text form.

Reverse engineering is not just used for hacking purposes, and is often a technique programmers use to find mistakes or errors in code in order to fix them.

In the case of apps, software reverse engineering involves translating the program's binary code back into the source code it was originally written in.

This source code reveals to the hackers how the app works, the steps it takes to complete certain tasks, and details about the app’s structure.

Hackers are able to manipulate this source code by adding in lines that connect the app to an external server, for example, or code that tells the app to reveal the password each time it’s entered.

More complicated code is used to create a rule, for example, that means every time a payment is sent, the same amount is sent to the hackers account.

Accomplished hackers can also edit the code to hide these changes from the program, so the software assumes everything is working as it should.



Once the changes are made, the edited code is uploaded back onto the company’s server.

And, as Winston Bond explained, all of these steps can be carried out using tools freely available online.



There are even online video tutorials that show programmers, as well as a hackers, how to access the source code of software.



He did point out that iOS apps and software are more secure and closely monitored than Android, for example - except on jailbroken devices.

'Jailbreaking' is the process of removing certain restrictions Apple places on apps and downloads, for example, and makes it easier for developers to adjust settings.

Reverse engineering is the process of taking an object apart to see how it works. It is not just used for hacking purposes, and is often used by programmers to find mistakes or errors in code. Software reverse engineering involves translating a program's binary code, stock image, back into the source code it was written in

HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF?

Many apps are now using additional software, including those developed by Arxan Technologies to prevent hackers from reverse engineering their products.

However, firms do not reveal if they are protected by such services so users are advised to only download apps from official app stores.

People should keep an eye on bank statements and report any irregularities.

They should also check in the phone's settings for any unusual looking processes running in the background. If any look suspicious, users can search online for the names of processes to see what they do.

Experts also suggest installing antivirus apps on mobile devices.



In many of the cases where banking apps are hacked, Bond continued the attack only works when a user downloads a separate, malicious app.

The demonstration was created after an Arxan study found hackers attacked 78 per cent of the top 100 paid Android and iOS apps last year.



It revealed there were hacked versions of 100 per cent of the top 100 paid apps for Android, and 56 per cent of the top 100 paid apps for iOS.

Last year, Arxan found attackers modified 80 per cent of free Android apps, and this year, this was down to 73 per cent in the same category.



On iOS devices, 40 per cent were hacked last year, compared to 53 per cent this year.",2023-10-19 22:18:19.855554+00:00,True,True,True,,0.8500164176738497,Beware of online banking: Security expert reveals that ANYONE can hack a bank's app - Daily Mail,"Title: ""Banking App Hacked Using Reverse Engineering Technique""","The software failure incident occurred when a mobile security expert demonstrated how a banking app can be hacked using reverse engineering.

You don’t have to be a sophisticated hacker to wreak havoc with the tool, which has been sold via PayPal for as little as $40. “Blackshades was a tool created and marketed principally for buyers who wouldn’t know how to hack their way out of a paper bag,” wrote Brian Krebs of Krebs on Security. “The product was sold via well-traveled and fairly open hacker forums, and even included an active user forum where customers could get help configuring and wielding the powerful surveillance tool.”

“The RAT is inexpensive and simple to use, but its capabilities are sophisticated and its invasiveness breathtaking,” said U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara, in a press release. “As today’s case makes clear, we now live in a world where, for just $40, a cybercriminal halfway across the globe can – with just a click of a mouse – unleash a RAT that can spread a computer plague not only on someone’s property, but also on their privacy and most personal spaces.”

1. It’s just a tricked-out version of a really common tool.

Anyone can buy a remote access tool. Office IT departments use RATs so they can fix problems with employees’ computers when they don’t happen to be in the office. The difference is that the IT guy has administrative access – he isn’t sneaking into your computer without permission.

Hackers, however, infect their victims with Blackshades by tricking them into clicking links that install the malware, or by hiring others to install the RAT.

Once installed, cybercriminals can lure other victims by sending malicious links through the first victim’s social media accounts. The instant message or e-mail would look like it came from the victim, making it more likely that the recipient would click on it.

Unlike regular RATs, Blackshades includes sinister bells and whistles such as Java exploits and the ability to launch DDoS attacks. It can be used to encrypt and lock files, forcing users to pay ransom to regain access. The program also modifies itself to elude antivirus software.

“It was sort of like the Swiss Army knife of criminal hacking tools,” Thomas Brown, senior managing director at FTI Consulting and former assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, told The Washington Post’s Andrea Peterson.

2. It’s been used for sextortion.

Remember Miss Teen USA, Cassidy Wolf? She was a victim of Blackshades. A 20-year-old kid named Jared James Abrahams used Blackshades to take nude photos of Wolf and others through their webcams. He threatened to post the photos online if the girls refused to video chat with him or send more nude pictures. He was sentenced to 18 months for his efforts.

3. Governments use tools such as Blackshades RAT for espionage and intelligence gathering.

Here’s what the FBI press release doesn’t tell you: Blackshades is just a cheaper version of similar spying software legally marketed for government and law enforcement use. Programs sold by Hacking Team and Gamma, for example, also allow users gain unauthorized access to someone else’s computer. A recent report from Toronto-based surveillance watchdog Citizen Lab showed Hacking Team’s software was being used in 21 countries, including some that suppress civil liberties and have poor human rights records. Hacking Team told Mashable the report was inaccurate. Citizen Lab also reported in 2012 that RATs were used to target journalists and activists in Syria.

“The 16 governments bringing charges may have a tough time with their cases if they were arresting people for possession of the software package,” writes the Daily Beast’s Quinn Norton. “Without logs or other evidence of the purchasers using the software against unsuspecting targets, most of those governments will have to prove that the purchasers intended to use the software in an illegal way.“

A two-foot-long steel strut only an inch wide at its thickest point was to blame for last month’s midair explosion of an unmanned SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, according to a preliminary investigation. The CEO of SpaceX, Elon Musk, said on Monday that the part, provided by an external supplier he declined to name, was “not something that should ever have failed at this force level”.

The disaster, a major setback for Musk’s ambitious space plans, also destroyed the Dragon spacecraft that the Falcon 9 was carrying. The Dragon, a partially reusable spacecraft developed by SpaceX, was due for a rendezvous at the International Space Station.

In his first public comments on the disaster, Musk said the strut “would appear to be incorrectly made but with no visible way of determining that from the outside”. The part held in place a tank of helium pressurized at about 55,000 pounds per square inch, cooled cryogenically by liquid oxygen and fed into the engine and back out again to keep the pressure equal in the rocket’s second stage.

“The strut that we believe failed was designed to handle 10,000lb of force and it failed at 2,000lb of force,” Musk said.

He also said that the Dragon could have been saved. “If the software had initiated the parachute deployment, the Dragon spacecraft would have survived,” Musk said. “We’re adding additional software so that the the spacecraft will always attempt to save itself. It’s an unfortunate thing.”



Musk said the test of SpaceX’s next version of its rocket, the Falcon Heavy, had been pushed back to the spring of 2016.

Musk cautioned that further investigation by SpaceX might reveal more over time but said that the inquiry, conducted in cooperation with the Federal Aviation Administration, Nasa and the US air force, suggested the strut had allowed the helium tank to shoot up through the stage as its buoyancy increased in proportion to the gravitational pressure of the rocket’s acceleration, ultimately releasing helium into the liquid oxygen and causing “a pressure event”.



That event took place over .893 seconds – part of the reason the findings were only preliminary. “When milliseconds matter, it’s remarkably difficult to line things up exactly right,” he said.

“It’s very difficult to test a rocket stage,” Musk said. “The only way to fully test a rocket stage would be to have an enormous centrifuge that doesn’t exist on Earth.”

The tech CEO said he believed the company had begun to rest on its laurels after several successful launches. “The company as a whole, I think, became a little bit complacent over seven years, after 20 successes in a row,” he said, “and this is an important lesson and something we’re going to take with us in the future.”

Musk said SpaceX wouldn’t be using those specific struts in the future and, when the replacements were selected, would be testing each one individually irrespective of the supplier’s certification.

Like a wedding officiant, Musk asks his employees to speak or forever hold their peace, he told reporters. “Before any flight I always send out an email saying: ‘If anyone can think of any possible reason why we should keep this flight from launching, they should call me on my cellphone or email me whether their manager agrees with it or not,’” he said. “I think sometimes it just seems like Elon being paranoid again.”



The failure, he said, wouldn’t affect the company’s submission for Nasa’s upcoming commercial cargo contract.

“Rockets are a fundamentally difficult thing,” he said.",2023-10-23 21:09:17.024543+00:00,True,True,True,,0.814390310336866,"SpaceX rocket exploded due to faulty steel strut, Elon Musk says - The Guardian",Steel Strut Failure Led to SpaceX Falcon 9 Rocket Explosion,"The software failure incident occurred on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket during a midair explosion.

The cause of the failure was determined to be an incorrectly made strut that was unable to handle the force it was designed for. The impact of the failure was the destruction of the Dragon spacecraft that the Falcon 9 was carrying, resulting in a major setback for SpaceX's space plans. The responsible entity for the failure was the external supplier who provided the faulty strut. The impacted entity was SpaceX, as their rocket and spacecraft were destroyed. Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX, mentioned that the Dragon spacecraft could have been saved if the software had initiated the parachute deployment. As a result, additional software will be added to ensure the spacecraft always attempts to save itself.

Update at 2:19 p.m. ET on 2/18/2016: Just hours ago, Apple apologized and admitted that Error 53 was indeed a mistake and not a deliberate security feature. ""This was designed to be a factory test and was not intended to affect customers,"" Apple  said to TechCrunch . They also released an updated version of iOS 9.2.1 that fixes Error 53, effectively ""unbricking"" phones disabled by the problem and preventing it from happening in phones repaired outside of Apple's network. iFixit techs are verifying the fix in our lab and will update when we have results.* This is a  victory for consumers and a clear concession that independent repair is an important part of the ecosystem. Until recently, not many people knew about Error 53, the strange, seemingly-inexplicable glitch that quietly turns working iPhones into iPaperweights. Scattered across the Internet, reports had emerged for months of people whose phones were permanently disabled after an iOS update. Then, quite suddenly, the error hit the fan. In response to an investigation that I assisted  The Guardian  with, Apple  confirmed  that Error 53 was real, and it targeted phones that had been repaired by anyone other than Apple. Specifically, Error 53 is triggered by repairs—made by the owner or an independent repair shop—that affect the home button and its flex cable. Why the big fuss over such a little button? An iPhone’s home button---with its embedded fingerprint sensor---is paired to a phone at the factory. Thanks to entropy, sometimes home buttons break; sometimes they get replaced when users swap out a shattered screen. When you replace an original home button with a different one, iOS detects the hardware change. And it shuts down Touch ID completely (which is a good security feature). Only Apple has the tech to make the complete transplant—remapping the sensor to keep Touch ID valid. But for some, the loss of Touch ID is worth an otherwise functioning phone. Lots of people  don’t live anywhere near an Apple store —so they go to a local shop or they do the repair on their own. I don’t think Error 53 was intentional—I think it was a mistake. But I think it’s a mistake that Apple is taking advantage of. Post-repair, those iPhones don’t have Touch ID---but life goes on. Owners use their passcode for security instead—they go on Snapchatting and selfie-ing as before. Sometimes for months. Until they plug into iTunes and update iOS. Then, boom! Error 53, and a bricked phone. I run iFixit, the  free online repair manual . Our community of repair experts help people  fix their electronics —and we sell the parts and tools for repairs. Error 53 has been  lighting up our forums  for months. When the error made national headlines, people asked me: Is Apple trying to kill the third-party repair industry? Officially, Apple says no. They say that Error 53 is a security measure—or as  Apple put it , “Error 53 is the result of security checks designed to protect our customers.” An Apple spokesperson also  told  The Guardian , We protect fingerprint data using a secure enclave, which is uniquely paired to the touch ID sensor. When iPhone is serviced by an authorised Apple service provider or Apple retail store for changes that affect the touch ID sensor, the pairing is re-validated. This check ensures the device and the iOS features related to touch ID remain secure. Without this unique pairing, a malicious touch ID sensor could be substituted, thereby gaining access to the secure enclave. When iOS detects that the pairing fails, touch ID, including Apple Pay, is disabled so the device remains secure. Apple  is  serious about security . It has led the charge to protect users’ data and privacy—from  end-to-end encryption in iMessage  to  pushing back against the FBI  seeking a backdoor into phones. Its policy proposals are spot-on. Google's silence on end-to-end encryption is deafening. Tim Cook's outspoken stand in favor of individual privacy is principled and technically sound. That said, I’ve got a couple bones to pick. As far as I can tell, Error 53 is  not  a security measure. Any more than using an iPhone 5---a phone that’s never had a fingerprint sensor to begin with---is a security risk. A phone with a third-party replaced home button is is still “protected by passcode lock and iCloud lock,”  says iDevice expert Jessa Jones . “‘New’ home buttons that do have a fingerprint sensor (i.e. one from another original iPhone) do not have functional Touch ID because it is not the original button. Apple Pay by Touch ID is already disabled. What gain is there to brick the phone at update?” If the problem is abuse of the Touch ID function, then great, swapping home buttons disables that functionality---problem solved. There’s no evidence that a “malicious” or “fraudulent” touch ID sensor even exists. I know the aftermarket backward and forward, and my connections in Asia and around the world have no knowledge of any malicious parts. OK, OK maybe the malicious parts haven’t been invented yet. But is Apple  really  going to be that forward-thinking? According to its upgrade cycle, I should be throwing this phone away in favor of the iPhone 7 in a little over six months. Apple also told  The Guardian  that “when an iPhone is serviced by an unauthorised repair provider, faulty screens or other invalid components that affect the touch ID sensor could cause the check to fail… ” That sounds reasonable, but Error 53 has nothing to do with faulty aftermarket parts. We’ve  reproduced the error with new OEM parts  from a different iPhone. Error 53 is a matter of part synchrony, not bad parts. Writes Jones: “The statement from Apple is another 'dig' at independent repair in the battle to get people to stop fixing their phones and just upgrade already.” I’m forced to agree. It’s no secret that Apple has been resistant to repairs outside of its network. Unlike other manufacturers like Dell and HP, it  limits outside access  to replacement parts, service information, and service tools. At the moment, Apple has the ability to “re-validate” a Touch ID sensor. Owners and professional repair techs don’t. I don’t think Error 53 was intentional—I think it was a mistake. But I think it’s a mistake that Apple is taking advantage of. Such tactics aren’t new. As early as 1956,  IBM got in major trouble  after refusing to allow third-parties to repair or upgrade its machines. So  did Kodak in 1992 . And so did  Avaya in 2014 . There are many more examples—but the courts have been clear: you can’t create a monopoly around repair. Despite the legal precedent, electronics makers usually default to ‘no’ when it comes to outside repairs. Nikon, for example, made headlines in 2012 when it stopped  selling replacement parts  to independent repair shops—funneling repairs instead to its own centers. That same year, Toshiba drew the ire of consumers when it  demanded the mass takedown of service manuals  from a repair tech’s website. Or there’s the HTC One, which was  nearly impossible to disassemble  and fix—unless you had a super secret tool that apparently  only HTC possessed . There are some electronics makers that are doing it right,  like Fairphone —which sells replacement parts and provides service information to anyone who asks. But companies like that are more the exception than a rule. They shouldn’t be. Repair is repair---whether it’s auto repair or iPhone repair. When you swap the tires on your Ford Explorer, you must rebalance them. You don’t have to go to Ford for that—the corner repair shop has the tools to do it. Most wouldn’t put up with any automaker who limited maintenance to “authorized” repair shops. If you want to, you can pay a bit more to go to the dealer---but (and here’s what’s important) that’s  your  choice. Why do we have this choice? Because someone fought for your right to get your car fixed where you want. But those laws got outdated, and so manufacturers started  restricting independent access to electronic diagnostics ---arguing that modern security required these precautions to protect owners against thieves and hackers. (Sound familiar to Error 53?) It's a familiar tune and voters were sick of it. So sick, in fact, that Massachusetts voters overwhelmingly passed  a Right to Repair law  in 2012, giving independent car technicians access to the same diagnostic tools, service information, and security reset software that the dealer’s mechanics have. Once the law passed in Massachusetts, automakers agreed to apply the  same terms nationwide . Repair is repair---whether it’s auto repair or iPhone repair. As a repair professional, I have a bias, of course. But it's a bias in favor of fixing a problem. Error 53 is a manufactured problem. Apple should focus on what they do best—manufacturing products—and back off on making problems. Owners should be able get their phones repaired where they please: at home, with the original manufacturer, or with an independent repair shop. Just last week, iFixit (my organization) teamed up with dozens of other repair shops, reuse organizations, and recycling companies to launch  repair.org ---a group that represents consumer and professional repairers. We’re fighting for your right to repair your stuff. We’ve already helped  introduce legislation in several states  that would allow consumers to get their products repaired where they please. Because no company should be allowed to destroy your phone in a fit of jealous rage, just because you decided to date a different repair shop.",2023-10-24 05:40:28.670902+00:00,True,True,True,,0.9520160024599515,Apple Shouldn't Get to Brick Your iPhone Because You Fixed It Yourself - WIRED,,"The software failure, known as Error 53, occurred after an iOS update and affected iPhones that had been repaired by anyone other than Apple.

Apple Support, but many devices are unrecoverable

If a mysterious error code called 'Error 53' pops up on your iPhone 6 or 6 Plus, brace yourself.

This message has been occurring on iPhones since the emergence of iOS 9 updates.

For devices that have undergone third-party repairs, the error message could mean imminent death.

Apple says that the error appears to protect customers, but thousands of users are claiming that it has rendered their iPhones useless, and any data kept within is lost without hope of retrieval.

If a mysterious error code called 'Error 53' pops up on your iPhone, brace yourself. This message has been occurring on iPhones since the emergence of iOS 9 updates, and for devices that have undergone third-party repairs, it could mean imminent death

WHAT IS ERROR 53? iOS checks that the Touch ID sensor in your iPhone or iPad correctly matches your device's other components. If iOS finds a mismatch, the check fails and Touch ID, including for Apple Pay use, is disabled. As a result, Error 53 shows up, rendering the phone unusable. Any third-party repairs that affect this area, like the home-button or the screen, can spur the messages, and thus, the death-sentence, for an iPhone.

The focal point of the issue lies in the security measures of the Touch ID sensor.

Apple released its latest statement on the issue to AppleInsider, explaining the security purposes behind the move.

The statement said, 'We take our customer security very seriously and Error 53 is the result of security checks designed to protect our customers.'

'iOS checks that the Touch ID sensor in your iPhone or iPad correctly matches your device's other components.

'If iOS finds a mismatch, the check fails and Touch ID, including for Apple Pay use, is disabled.

'This security measure is necessary to protect your device and prevent a fraudulent Touch ID sensor from being used.

'If a customer encounters Error 53, we encourage them to contact Apple Support.'

The touch ID sensor records fingerprints, and keeps that data protected with a 'secure enclave,' an Apple spokeswoman explained in an earlier statement to The Guardian.

Any third-party repairs that affect this area, like the home-button or the screen, can spur the messages, and thus, the death-sentence, for an iPhone.

Many have criticized this move, including Kyle Wiens, head of the electronics-repair site iFixit.com, who said that the policy is harsh, and 'ridiculous.' Apple has recommended taking the phone to an Apple Store, but not all iPhone users have official Apple repair centres in their areas

The Apple spokeswoman explains that 'faulty screens or other invalid components,' can disrupt the unique pairing methods of the touch ID, disabling the phone so it remains secure.

The company has recommended users contact Apple Support for help.

But, once Error 53 comes up, contacting Apple Support may not be of much help.

As the Wall Street Journal points out, some customers have gone to the Apple Store only to be turned away as the error message was like 'the plague,' and the unauthorized repairs had voided the device's warranty.

Thousands of iPhone 6 users claim they have been left holding almost worthless phones because Apple’s latest operating system permanently disables the handset if it detects that a repair has been carried out by a non-Apple technician.

Relatively few people outside the tech world are aware of the so-called “error 53” problem, but if it happens to you you’ll know about it. And according to one specialist journalist, it “will kill your iPhone”.

The issue appears to affect handsets where the home button, which has touch ID fingerprint recognition built-in, has been repaired by a “non-official” company or individual. It has also reportedly affected customers whose phone has been damaged but who have been able to carry on using it without the need for a repair.

But the problem only comes to light when the latest version of Apple’s iPhone software, iOS 9, is installed. Indeed, the phone may have been working perfectly for weeks or months since a repair or being damaged.

After installation a growing number of people have watched in horror as their phone, which may well have cost them £500-plus, is rendered useless. Any photos or other data held on the handset is lost – and irretrievable.

Tech experts claim Apple knows all about the problem but has done nothing to warn users that their phone will be “bricked” (ie, rendered as technologically useful as a brick) if they install the iOS upgrade.

No choice: journalist Antonio Olmos dropped his iPhone while covering the refugee crisis and had to use a local repair shop

Freelance photographer and self-confessed Apple addict Antonio Olmos says this happened to his phone a few weeks ago after he upgraded his software. Olmos had previously had his handset repaired while on an assignment for the Guardian in Macedonia. “I was in the Balkans covering the refugee crisis in September when I dropped my phone. Because I desperately needed it for work I got it fixed at a local shop, as there are no Apple stores in Macedonia. They repaired the screen and home button, and it worked perfectly.”

He says he thought no more about it, until he was sent the standard notification by Apple inviting him to install the latest software. He accepted the upgrade, but within seconds the phone was displaying “error 53” and was, in effect, dead.

When Olmos, who says he has spent thousands of pounds on Apple products over the years, took it to an Apple store in London, staff told him there was nothing they could do, and that his phone was now junk. He had to pay £270 for a replacement and is furious.

How can a company deliberately make its own product useless with an upgrade, and not warn customers about it? Antonio Olmos

“The whole thing is extraordinary. How can a company deliberately make their own products useless with an upgrade and not warn their own customers about it? Outside of the big industrialised nations, Apple stores are few and far between, and damaged phones can only be brought back to life by small third-party repairers.

“I am not even sure these third-party outfits even know this is a potential problem,” he says.

Olmos is far from the only one affected. If you Google “iPhone 6” and “error 53” you will find no shortage of people reporting that they have been left with a phone that now only functions as a very expensive paperweight.

Posting a message on an Apple Support Communities forum on 31 December, “Arjunthebuster” is typical. He/she says they bought their iPhone 6 in January 2015 in Dubai, and dropped it the following month causing a small amount of damage.

They carried on using the phone, but when they tried to install iOS 9 in November “error 53” popped up. “The error hasn’t occurred because I broke my phone (it was working fine for 10 months). I lost all my data because of this error. I don’t want Apple to fix my screen or anything! I just want them to fix the ‘error 53’ so I can use my phone, but they won’t!”

Could Apple’s move, which appears to be designed to squeeze out independent repairers, contravene competition rules? Car manufacturers, for example, are not allowed to insist that buyers only get their car serviced by them.

Apple charges £236 for a repair to the home button on an iPhone 6 in the UK, while an independent repairer would demand a fraction of that.

California-based tech expert Kyle Wiens, who runs the iFixit website, says this is a major issue. “The ‘error 53’ page on our website has had more than 183,000 hits, suggesting this is a big problem for Apple users,” he told Guardian Money. “The problem occurs if the repairer changes the home button or the cable. Following the software upgrade the phone in effect checks to make sure it is still using the original components, and if it isn’t, it simply locks out the phone. There is no warning, and there’s no way that I know of to bring it back to life.”

He says it is unclear whether this is a deliberate move to force anyone who drops their phone to use Apple for a repair. “All along, Apple’s view is that it does not want third parties carrying out repairs to its products, and this looks like an obvious extension of that,” he says. “What it should do is allow its customers to recalibrate their phone after a repair. Only when there is a huge outcry about this problem will it do something.”

The Daily Dot website features an article by tech writer Mike Wehner headlined “Error 53 will kill your iPhone and no one knows what it is”. He relates how his own iPhone 6 Plus was left “effectively dead to the world”.

Only when there is a huge outcry about this problem will Apple do something Kyle Wiens

Meanwhile, an article by tech writer Reuben Esparza, published in November by iCracked, a phone repair service, states: “When pressed for more information about the error, few, if any Apple employees could offer an explanation. There was no part they would replace, no software fix, and no way to access the phone’s memory. The fix was a new iPhone.” It continues: “Though still largely a mystery to most, we now know that error 53 is the result of a hardware failure somewhere within the home button assembly.”

A spokeswoman for Apple told Money (get ready for a jargon overload): “We protect fingerprint data using a secure enclave, which is uniquely paired to the touch ID sensor. When iPhone is serviced by an authorised Apple service provider or Apple retail store for changes that affect the touch ID sensor, the pairing is re-validated. This check ensures the device and the iOS features related to touch ID remain secure. Without this unique pairing, a malicious touch ID sensor could be substituted, thereby gaining access to the secure enclave. When iOS detects that the pairing fails, touch ID, including Apple Pay, is disabled so the device remains secure.”

She adds: “When an iPhone is serviced by an unauthorised repair provider, faulty screens or other invalid components that affect the touch ID sensor could cause the check to fail if the pairing cannot be validated. With a subsequent update or restore, additional security checks result in an ‘error 53’ being displayed … If a customer encounters an unrecoverable error 53, we recommend contacting Apple support.”",2023-10-24 05:44:18.527412+00:00,True,True,True,,0.9445751062812532,‘Error 53’ fury mounts as Apple software update threatens to kill your iPhone 6 - The Guardian,,"The software failure incident, known as ""error 53,"" occurred when iPhone 6 users installed the latest version of Apple's iPhone software, iOS 9.

After installing the software upgrade, users found their phones displaying ""error 53"" and becoming unusable. The failure resulted in the loss of all data stored on the handset.

Apple has released a fix for users affected by “Error 53”, a software issue that rendered useless iPhones that had had their home buttons replaced by third parties.

The problem was related to Apple’s Touch ID fingerprint reader, which is part of the home button and can be used to unlock the device instead of inputting a passcode.



If a non-Apple repairer replaced the button on a damaged iPhone or iPad, a subsequent update of the operating system detected a non-standard component and shut down the device. There was no way to restart it.

Earlier this month the Guardian highlighted the fury of thousands of users who had their damaged phones repaired only to find their devices were later unexpectedly “bricked” when updating the operating system.

At the time Apple said that Error 53 was a security feature to protect customers. It said: “This security measure is necessary to protect your device and prevent a fraudulent Touch ID sensor from being used. If a customer encounters Error 53, we encourage them to contact Apple Support.”

However, now the company says the issue was a “factory test”. Issuing a fix with an updated version of its operating system iOS 9.2.1, Apple told the tech site TechCrunch that it apologised for any inconvenience to customers. It added: “This was designed to be a factory test and was not intended to affect customers. Customers who paid for an out-of-warranty replacement of their device based on this issue should contact AppleCare about a reimbursement.”

The turnaround comes after widespread publicity and the Californian tech giant being served with a class action lawsuit over in the US and attention from a competition watchdog in Australia.

The fix will let users with disabled iPhones clear the error by connecting them to iTunes and installing the updated iOS. The update can not be applied directly to the phone via the cloud – although iPhones updated in that way were unaffected.

Solving Error 53 does not re-enable Touch ID, as a third-party replacement of the home button could potentially allow unauthorised access to a locked phone by modifying the fingerprint sensor.

The fix comes as the security of Apple’s devices is at the centre of a standoff between the company and the US government over access to the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino killers.",2023-10-24 05:44:19.188151+00:00,True,True,True,,0.9616282421159255,Apple apologises over Error 53 and issues fix for bricked iPhones - The Guardian,,"The software failure incident, known as ""Error 53"", occurred when users with iPhones or iPads had their home buttons replaced by third-party repairers.

Apple has hit back at criticism of its controversial “Error 53” message on iPhones, claiming it is part of measures to protect customers’ security.

On Friday, the Guardian revealed how thousands of iPhone 6 users have had their devices, which cost hundreds of pounds, left useless after encountering the error message.

The problem is related to the smartphone’s home button, which contains a Touch ID thumbprint reader that can be used to unlock the device rather than inputting a four-digit security code.



If the phone is damaged and a non-Apple repairer replaces the button, a subsequent update of the operating system detects a non-standard component and shuts down the device. There is no known way of bringing it back to life.

Many iPhone 6 owners have only become aware of the issue when installing routine updates to iOS, Apple’s operating system for iPhones and iPads. It is unclear exactly how many have been affected.

In a statement released following the publication of the Guardian’s story, an Apple spokesperson said: “We take customer security very seriously and Error 53 is the result of security checks designed to protect our customers. iOS checks that the Touch ID sensor in your iPhone or iPad correctly matches your device’s other components.

“If iOS finds a mismatch, the check fails and Touch ID, including for Apple Pay use, is disabled. This security measure is necessary to protect your device and prevent a fraudulent Touch ID sensor from being used. If a customer encounters Error 53, we encourage them to contact Apple Support.”

However, some users have also encountered Error 53 messages even though their device has not been altered or repaired in any way. That is what happened to US technology writer Mike Wehner last year when his iPhone 6 suffered intermittent problems with the Touch ID sensor.

Although he was able to get a replacement device at an Apple store, thousands of users whose phones have been repaired have not been so lucky. As third-party hardware has been installed on their devices, Apple deems its terms and conditions to have been broken and forced many owners to contribute towards the cost of a new phone.

With many Apple customers left furious at the company’s stance, one Guardian reader comments: “I think they made an after-the-fact adjustment to a poorly conceived and implemented security system on the iPhone. They hadn’t properly considered the implications of third parties substituting parts on the phones, whether these were bonafide alterations or not.

“They didn’t think about the customers at all (Apple are arrogant enough to do this). Or they decided that it isn’t their problem if customers do something other than what they recommend. Surely even Apple now realise it is their problem? They will have to sort it out.”

A reader of the Boing Boing technology blog said Apple should have advertised the fact rather than keeping it hidden.

If they included a warning in the package ‘tamper resistance’ feature that works by non-Apple-authorised repair services may be mistaken for tampering attempts, and lead to the phone being disabled’, then it would be purely a feature ... By concealing the feature prior to sales, and only even revealing it after being repeatedly pressured over it, Apple turned what could have been a feature into a landmine.”

Apple shares have fallen more than 20% in the past three months as investors begin to doubt whether it can maintain the stellar growth posted since the iPhone first went on sale eight years ago. The company relies on the smartphone for about two thirds of its revenue.



Last month Apple said iPhone sales were flat for the three months to December, with about 74.8m devices bought in the quarter. Its most recent device, the Apple watch, has failed to capture consumers’ imagination and iPad sales are also on the slide.

Much is therefore riding on the success of the iPhone 7, expected to be released in September, but slowing global smartphone sales could make that a difficult feat to pull off even for Apple.

8 febrero 2016

Fuente de la imagen, Thinkstock Pie de foto, El Error 53 deja al teléfono inhabilitado, de forma que ya no se puede acceder a la información interna.

Se llama Error 53 y es implacable.

Aparece tras la última actualización del sistema operativo de Apple, iOS 9, en aquellos iPhone 6 que han pasado por alguna ""reparación no oficial"" y hace que el teléfono ya no vuelva a funcionar.

En verdad, el Error 53 no es nuevo. En una información publicada en el sitio de soporte técnico de Apple actualizada al 21 de diciembre, la compañía explica: ""Cuando iOS encuentra un módulo de Touch ID (el sistema de reconocimiento dactilar del iPhone) que no está identificado o es inesperado, la verificación falla"".

Y se agrega: ""Por ejemplo, un cambio de pantalla no autorizado o defectuoso puede causar un error en la verificación"". En este caso, continúa, se debe contactar al soporte de Apple para conocer ""la información sobre precios para reparaciones fuera de garantía"".

Lo nuevo es que con iOS 9 no importa que el arreglo no oficial tuviera semanas o meses de antigüedad. El software lo detecta y deshabilita al teléfono.

Fuente de la imagen, Getty Pie de foto, Apple informó que el Error 53 es una medida de seguridad para prevenir un sensor de Touch ID fraudulento.

Cuando esto sucede, la información sin copias de seguridad (por ejemplo, fotografías) queda inaccesible.

Hasta el momento, no existe una forma de repararlo ni siquiera en las tiendas oficiales de Apple y se desconoce cuántos usuarios se han visto afectados.

""Una medida de seguridad""

En un comunicado enviado a BBC, Apple informó que el Error 53 es el ""resultado de revisiones de seguridad"".

""Nos tomamos la seguridad de nuestros clientes con mucha seriedad"", decía el comunicado. ""iOS revisa que el sensor de Touch ID en tu iPhone o iPad coincida de forma correcta con otros componentes del dispositivo"".

""Si iOS encuentra un desajuste, la revisión falla y Touch ID, incluyendo la función Apple Pay, es deshabilitado. Esta medida de seguridad es necesaria para proteger tu dispositivo y prevenir el uso fraudulento del sensor de Touch ID"".

De todos modos, el vocero de Apple invitó a los usuarios que recibieron este error a contactarse con el soporte oficial de la compañía.

Sin otra opción

Los motivos por los cuales los usuarios recurren a arreglos no oficiales de Apple se pueden resumir en dos: porque resultan más baratos o porque no existen firmas autorizadas en la región donde viven.

Fuente de la imagen, Getty Pie de foto, En caso de recibir el Error 53, Apple recomienda contactarse con el soporte oficial.

Este último es el caso del fotógrafo Antonio Olmos, quien se considera un adicto a los productos de Apple.

""En setiembre estaba en los Balcanes cubriendo la crisis de los refugiados, cuando se me cayó el teléfono"", le contó Olmos a The Guardian.

""Como lo necesitaba desesperadamente para trabajar, lo mandé a arreglar en un negocio local, dado que en Macedonia no existen tiendas Apple. Repararon la pantalla y el botón de inicio, y funcionó a la perfección."" Hasta que actualizó el software.

""¿Cómo una compañía puede deliberadamente volver inservibles sus propios productos con una actualización y ni siquiera advertir a sus clientes al respecto?"", dijo Olmos.",2023-10-24 06:08:48.853062+00:00,True,True,True,,0.9531832685851309,El “Error 53” que amenaza con matar tu iPhone 6 si actualizas el sistema operativo - BBC.com,,"The software failure, known as Error 53, occurred after the latest update of Apple's operating system, iOS 9, on iPhone 6 devices that had undergone ""unofficial repairs"". The failure specifically affected the Touch ID module, which is the fingerprint recognition system on the iPhone. If the Touch ID module was not identified or was unexpected, the verification process failed, rendering the phone inoperable. The error was not new, as Apple had previously explained that unauthorized or faulty screen changes could cause verification errors. However, with iOS 9, the software detected any previous unofficial repairs and disabled the phone, regardless of how long ago the repair had been done.

The impact of the failure was that the phone became completely disabled, and any data that was not backed up, such as photos, became inaccessible. Apple stated that Error 53 was a security measure to prevent the use of fraudulent Touch ID sensors. The company emphasized that the security of its customers was a top priority and that the verification process was necessary to protect the device and prevent fraudulent use of Touch ID.

The responsible entity for the software failure was Apple, as they implemented the security measure in iOS 9. The impacted entities were iPhone 6 users who had undergone unofficial repairs and subsequently updated their devices to iOS 9. It is unknown how many users were affected by Error 53. Apple recommended affected users to contact their official support for assistance, as there was no known way to repair the issue, even in Apple's official stores. The failure highlighted the reasons why users turned to unofficial repairs, such as cost or the lack of authorized repair options in their region.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Researcher have proved it's possible to trick an Android fingerprint sensor with office supplies and 15 minutes of your time.

The technique involves a method using a 300 dpi scan of a fingerprint to print, conductive ink, glossy paper and a standard inkjet printer.

Once the fingerprint is scanned, simply print it out with the special ink, cut the images the same size as your real finger print and place it on the phone to bypass the sensor.

Once the fingerprint is scanned, simply print it out with the special ink, cut the images the same size as your real finger print and place it on the phone to bypass the sensor

HOW DO YOU BYPASS FINGERPRINT SENSOR WITH A PRINTED FINGERPRINT? All you need are three AgIC sliver conductive ink cartridges, a regular black ink cartridge, glossy AgIC paper and a standard inkjet printer. First lift the fingerprint you use to unlock your phone and scan it into your computer. Scan the fingerprint image at 300 dpi or high resolution, but be sure to reverse the image horizontally so it will be a replica of the real thing. Next install the AgIC ink cartridges and the regular black on into the printer, as well as the glossy paper. Once you have completely the steps, just print the image out the same size as your real fingerprint, cut one out and roll it over the sensor, which should instantly unlock the device.

Researchers from Michigan State University show just how easy it is to lift a smartphone’s owner fingerprint, with the hopes of raising awareness of the vulnerability of finger print authentication.

‘Once the printed 2D fingerprints are ready we can then use them for spoofing mobile phones,’ reads the published study.

‘In our spoofing experiment, we selected Samsung Galaxy S6 and Huawei Hornor 7 phones as examples.’

‘We enrolled the left index finger of one of the authors and used the printed 2D fingerprint of this left index finger to unlock the fingerprint recognition systems in these phones.’

This hack has just a three main steps and can be done in the comfort of your own home.

‘We have proposed a simple, fast and effective method to generate 2D fingerprint spoofs that can successfully hack built-in fingerprint authentication in mobile phones,’ reads the study.

‘Furthermore, hackers can easily generate a large number of spoofs using fingerprint reconstruction or synthesis techniques which is easier than 2.5D fingerprint spoofs.’

This past Mobile World Congrees, Vkansee president Jason Chaikin demonstrated just how easily these sensors can be bypassed by lifting another person's fingerprint with common molding materials.

‘In our spoofing experiment, we selected Samsung Galaxy S6 and Huawei Hornor 7 phones as examples.’ ‘We enrolled the left index finger of one of the authors and used the printed 2D fingerprint of this left index finger to unlock the fingerprint recognition systems in these phone'

Using just a dental mould and a small amount of Play-Doh, fingerprints can be replicated to break into an iPhone in just a few attempts, it's said.

First, the phone owner presses their finger into the dental mold for five minutes, reads a blog post from the Wall Street Journal.

This isn’t the first time fingerprints have been printed to bypass the security sensors.

In 2013, hackers proved they could get around the Touch ID by lifting the print from a glass surface and printing it – similar to the method from Michigan University.

And in the same year, a Youtuber shared a trick of creating a mock fingerprint using just Gorilla Glue or Elmer’s Glue.

‘We have proposed a simple, fast and effective method to generate 2D fingerprint spoofs that can successfully hack built-in fingerprint authentication in mobile phones,’ reads the study. ‘Furthermore, hackers can easily generate a large number of spoofs using fingerprint reconstruction

In a response to the 2013 hacks, Rich Mogull of Securosis explained that the fingerprint-based security systems provide 'as much security as a strong passcode with the convenience of no passcode,' for the average user.

CAN PLAY-DOH HACK AN IPHONE? First, the phone owner presses his or her finger into a small glob of dental mould for five minutes. Then, once the mould is set, Play-Doh is pressed into it to replicate the impression. Once the impression has been obtained, anyone can use the Play-Doh version to bypass a locked iPhone's fingerprint sensor. Chaikin demonstrates how this can quickly unlock an iPhone. While it may not work on the first try, Chaikin is able to get into the phone with minimal attempts. But, the hack requires a bit of cooperation from the victim, so it's unlikely such a trick would translate easily into a real-life setting. Similar hacks in the past have raised little concerns from security experts, who say it provides as much security as a good passcode for the average person.

This holds true even now, in light of the recent Play-Doh hack concerns, Mogull explained in an email to Dailymail.com.

'These are low risk unless someone is specifically targeting you, and that person is either someone you trust that has great access to you and the device, or they are very technically proficient and motivated.

'Remember, on iOS your phone will time out the fingerprint sensor on every reboot or after 48 hours of inactivity. That really reduces the risk even if you lose your phone.

'You can also just turn the feature off whenever you want.'

'For example, I've been known to do that at certain hacker conferences... more for my friends messing with me than any real threat.

'Just think through what it would take for someone to get a good fingerprint and your device, and before you notice it and could remotely locate or erase it.'",2023-10-24 08:37:08.339146+00:00,True,True,True,,0.7916796858460134,Android security alert as researchers reveal how to beat fingerprint recognition - Daily Mail,Android Fingerprint Sensor Can Be Bypassed with Office Supplies,"The software failure described in the article is the vulnerability of fingerprint authentication on Android phones.

George Harrison's sister has revealed her heartbreak over not being told the Beatles star was dying and in terrible pain until two weeks before he lost his battle with lung cancer.

In an exclusive interview on the 15th anniversary of the music legend's death, Louise Harrison tells DailyMail.com of her anguish and shock over the loss and reveals how a bitter family fall-out marred her relationship with the music legend in his final years.

Louise, 85, claims that she and other siblings were left in the dark by George's wife, Olivia, who had kept many of her husband's medical issues from his family for years.

Louise is also angry that since George's passing she has had no contact with her nephew Dhani.

In an exclusive interview on the 15th anniversary of George Harrison's death, his sister Louise Harrison (left,with George in 1964, and right, in a recent photo) tells of her anguish and shock over the loss

She also reveals how a bitter family fall-out marred her relationship with the music legend in his final years

Louise, 85, claims that she and other siblings were left in the dark by George's wife, Olivia (right with George in 1979), who she says kept George's illness from the family

And she claims that her superstar brother would be 'horrified' that she was cut off by the estate from a $2,000-a-month pension.

Representatives of Olivia Harrison did not respond to DailyMail.com's request for comment.

George was worth more than $300 million when he died on November 29, 2001, but Louise now struggles to get by - living in a modest home in small-town Branson, Missouri.

While George, who was 58 when he died, left his widow Olivia and son Dhani the lavish Friar Park, a 120-room Victorian mansion in Henley-On-Thames just outside London, England, Louise still has to work to make ends meet - managing a touring Beatles tribute band.

Louise was born 12 years before her brother George

Louise reflects on how a decade and half ago, she said her farewells to her beloved brother by his bedside at a hospital in Staten Island, New York.

But she remembers how the famed guitarist refused to wallow in his deteriorating state, preferring to laugh and reminisce about their childhood together.

Louise spoke at length about her support and bond with her much-younger sibling,

Speaking from her home in Branson she remembers how she heard the heartbreaking news that George's health had deteriorated after a long-battle with lung cancer.

She said: 'I was in Toronto two weeks before he died when I finally heard that he was ill. I drove through New York, so I could try and get a chance to see him.

'As luck would have it, I was able to get in touch with his doctor who gave me the information to go to see him and I was able to see him for a couple hours.

'But the person who was in charge of him did not let his brothers or me know that he was sick.'

Nevertheless, Louise was given the opportunity to say goodbye to her brother, who just 14 days later would pass away at Paul McCartney's Beverly Hills mansion.

To say a final goodbye Louise was led into her brother's hospital room where she found a familiar, though diminished figure propped up in a reclining chair, clinging to life.

The only other people present were Olivia and her sister Linda, and nephew Dhani.

They left Louise and George to hold hands and reconcile for almost two hours.

In October of 1962, The Beatles (pictured in 1964) released Love Me Do in the UK and the nation became gripped by the four mop-tops and their sensational style

'George was pretty frail, yet he was also still vibrant,' she recalls.

'His eyes were still bright. He was very happy. We hugged. We talked about the fun things that made us laugh when we were kids. All the family jokes we laughed over for years. It was a very emotional moment.

'He was still George. He must have been in pain, but he didn't show it. We reminisced about our childhood, and his sense of humor was the same as ever.

'People always teased him about his sticky-out ears; now his oxygen tubes were hanging over them. He laughed and said: ""My ears finally came in useful for something.""'

As their time together drew to a close, George apologized to his sister.

'You know, I could have been a lot more help to you; I'm sorry,' he told her.

Louise, who has opened up the family album showing previously unseen photographs of her and George, recalls: 'He was pretty weak at that moment but he could still laugh.

'One of our family jokes and sayings was, ""Let's see what's round this next corner"".

'When we used to go on vacation, our dad would always book us in a cottage somewhere, either in Wales or some other part of England.

'We would take these walks and mum would see an interesting pathway, and the first time she said, ""Let's see what's round this corner"", we had to keep going for four miles before we could get back to the road again.

'So, the next time, we would say, ""No, no, no"", because we had to keep going around these corners. It took us ages.'

Louise remembers giving her brother a final hug and George said poignantly: 'Let's see what's round this next corner.'

Raising a smile Louise added: 'It was typical George.'

Louise, who lived in the United States when The Beatles hit the big time in the UK in the 1960s, helped the band make a name for itself in the United States by trying to get their songs on the radio. She got their hit From Me To You played on Chicago's WLS radio on February 25, 1963

Dick James wrote Louise a letter giving her permission to distribute Beatles records in the United States

When the music legend died many questions were left unanswered as to where exactly did he die and where were his ashes scattered.

An official LA County Coroner's death certificate said that he died at 1971 Coldwater Canyon in Beverly Hills, 90210 - a fake address.

But it was later changed to Paul McCartney's home.

Then, reports claimed that he was cremated at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery and his ashes were scattered in the Ganges and Yamuna River in India, in a private ceremony, according to his chosen religion Hindi tradition.

But Louise says she too was left in the dark by her sister-in-law.

'I know nothing about that. I mean if someone was so secretive that his siblings did not even know he was ill,' she said.

'Someone is being secretive for reasons that have nothing to do with me.

'Poor George did not even get any peace when he died. If someone is trying to keep a secret, then everyone has to try and figure out what was true. Just be open about it.

'I was not involved in the scattering of the ashes. I have heard so many crazy stories about the Beatles in general, so nothing would surprise me.'

In his latter years, George made sure his sister was looked after financially.

He set up a pension for Louise for tax reasons in 1980 and paid $2,000 into her account every month.

However, almost a year to the day after the guitarist died, Louise was inexplicably cut off by George's estate.

She was not given a reason why the money stopped and several attempts to reach out to Olivia and Dhani were greeted with silence.

Since that day, Louise has not spoken with her nephew and she believes George would be devastated to learn of her estrangement.

Harrison's mother, pictured right with George, helped him pack his bags before going on tour

'My second husband was an alcoholic. Both of my husbands were alcoholics. I had been beaten up a few times. George said to me, ""Don't go get married again. You don't seem to choose the right people very well. Let me fix you something to live on"".

'It was supposed to be a lifelong pension. It was a small amount. That was fine. That was okay.

'But when he died, it was cut off. But that's okay. I am still capable of earning my living at 85.'

She added: 'George would've been horrified knowing I was cut off. It was such a small amount. And I think he left something like $300 million. Let's put it this way, some people were more into money than I was.'

She continued, displaying much of the quiet stoicism her family is famous for: 'Money is not the most important. I learned that from George.'

While Louise admits many of her close friends are appalled by her plight, she refuses to let it upset her.

'I made sure life moved on for me, and I have happily supported myself ever since,' she explained.

'I live modestly, I don't hold anyone responsible for me and I'm happy to live like that.'

The loss of her pension isn't the only gripe Louise has with George's widow.

The grandmother, who wrote the book, My Kid Brother's Band A.K.A. The Beatles, before withdrawing it from the shelves, isn't happy that she was excluded from Martin Scorsese's HBO documentary about his life.

She believes she was written out of his history.

She says: 'All my friends asked, ""Did he get in touch with you?"" I had to admit, ""No"".

'My friend Mary Kellogg, who is a friend of Martin Scorsese, got in touch with his office, she said, ""Hey George's sister lives right here, she is a friend of mine"". But no one bothered getting in touch.'

Louise briefly spent time traveling with The Beatles. She's pictured above with the band after they appeared on the Ed Sullivan show

But Louise refuses to mention Olivia by name in her rant.

'A certain person, I am not mentioning any names, who was financing it, didn't want me to exist,' she says. 'People are doing underhanded things for money. I am not even selling my book because I cannot be bothered going through all the hassle.

'I would rather have half a dozen good friends than a million dollars.'

Louise also shies away from discussing why, how and when she and Olivia ever fell out.

'There is nothing to say,' she said.

While spending the '60s and the '70s very close to her brother, George reportedly distanced himself from Louise in the mid-'90s

She says he disapproved of the conversion of her old Illinois home into a 'Beatles bed-and-breakfast' inn, called A Hard Day's Night.

Louise didn't own the establishment, but did use her name to help promote it

But while many Beatles fans will feel that the rift was likely prompted by Louise, she is quick to point out she remains emotionless about her sister-in-law.

'I don't want to come across as harsh or bitter in any way, which is why I won't mention or say her name,' she said. 'Life moves on, I'm happy with where I am and what I'm doing and we don't have any contact.'

She added that even losing touch with her nephew is something that she no longer gets upset about.

Louise said: 'I knew Dhani when he was a small boy, but haven't had any contact with him since George passed away.

'But that's just how it is, that's life. I'm not bitter about it, it's just an unfortunate thing.'

Despite the family drama, Louise is proud of her efforts to try to turn four fresh-faced young Scousers [from Liverpool] into the biggest band America and the world had ever seen.

Almost a year to the day after George died, Louise was inexplicably cut off by George's estate. Several attempts to reach out to Olivia and Dhani were greeted with silence. George and Olivia are pictured above in 1976 (left) and the 1990s (right)

She moved to Illinois in the late 1950s with her Scottish mining engineer husband, Gordon Caldwell, and had two children, years before the Beatles themselves would launch a British 'invasion' in 1964.

Back in England in the late '50s, George had already met Paul McCartney on a bus in Liverpool and in 1958 aged 15 he joined Paul and John Lennon's band The Quarrymen. Ringo Starr joined the band, now named the Beatles, in August 1962.

In October that year the band released Love Me Do in the UK and the nation became gripped by the four mop-tops and their sensational style.

However, at that moment, the Beatles were unknown in America - a situation that their manager Brian Epstein hoped to change.

Louise stepped up to the task and, incredibly, she got their hit From Me To You played on Chicago's WLS radio on February 25, 1963 - the first known example of The Beatles getting airplay in the United States.

Louise recalls: 'I started running around all radio stations in the States saying quite innocently, ""This is my kid brother's band in England, they're number one, maybe you would like to be playing their records"".

'They were really looking down their noses at me like what on earth is this woman doing.

'I used to get the records sent to me by our mum in Liverpool, so I had all the singles before anyone in America had them.'

Louise said that she liaised with the Fab Four's manager Brian Epstein telling him that she was pushing out records to stations to help John, Paul, Ringo and George succeed.

She still has letters from Epstein, expressing gratitude for how she helped them break America.

'I did all I could to help my kid brother,' she says.

Louise also claims to have been instrumental in getting the Beatles signed to mega-label Capitol Records, who had initially turned down the band.

In 1963, George spent two weeks at Louise's home.

Since being cut from the estate, Louise has not spoken with her nephew, Dhani (pictured with his parents, George and Olivia, in 1988) and she believes George would be devastated to learn of her estrangement.

She recalls how he was able to walk the streets unrecognized, he went camping and played with a local band in front of a small crowd of 150.

Five months later he returned to the United States with The Beatles to appear on The Ed Sullivan Show watched by 73 million people - and the history of popular music changed forever.

Louise traveled to New York to see her now world-famous brother and met John, Ringo and Paul and eventually George's then girlfriend, Patti Boyd - for whom he would end up writing the ballad Something.

She recalls how she witnessed 'Beatlemania' take off.

'It was chaotic,' she recalls. 'I had worked all year writing to Brian's secretary Diane Vero, passing along all the information about the music business, including Capitol Records, which was one of the top three in the country.

'I was passing those details on to them. When they came here Capitol Records themselves sent me my itinerary to be with them when they were in New York because they knew what I had done.

'The funny thing was I remember Brian saying how grateful he was.

'But what I didn't realize was that Brian was also setting up interviews.'

Louise recalls how the two clashed over media opportunities with the band.

Louise says that tensions grew further when George fell ill during the important trip.

'George had come down with a 104-degree fever,' she remembers. 'Brian refused to let George go to the hospital, so I had to be the nurse.

'Every hour I gave him medication and do things like put ice around his neck.

'He was at New York's Plaza Hotel, and outside his room all these DJs from other radio stations were waiting in the hallway upset at not having an interview.

'George told me, ""I am never going to be able to get to sleep with all of this noise. These big DJ voice guys with their deep rumbling voices"".

'So I went outside and to say he was ill, they were all upset as all had played the Beatles records all week and were selling millions.'

During her time with The Beatles, Louise says one of her favorite memories was getting to know John, Paul and Ringo's personalities intimately. Pictured above, she smiles with Paul McCartney and two unidentified people

Louise recalls how she then agreed to travel to the radio stations with the DJs and gave them an interview.

'At the station I went on air, was having a lot of fun and I suddenly realized it was time for George to have his medication, so I said I needed to call the hotel and talk to my brother for a minute.

'The guy at the radio station said, ""Hey, can we speak to George for a minute?"" So he gets on the phone with these guys, plays a few chords, talks to them, and unbeknownst to me, they record this conversation with George.

'It was only about five minutes. Then they took me back to the hotel and dropped me off.

'Straight away every hour they played the interview.

'Brian was furious at me because I had messed up an exclusive deal he had with another station and after that Brian wanted nothing to do with me anymore.

'And that was it with the Beatles' team - so much for being grateful for getting them into the United States.'

Louise continues: 'But I started to be mad at myself too as George was so ill, and hardly able to speak because his throat was so sore.

'He was rushed around press conferences and photoshoots - they were treating him like he was a prop.

Today Louise is still linked to The Fab Four, managing a successful Beatles tribute act called the Liverpool Legends

'If I had any idea that this was how they were going to be treating him, I would never have ever wanted him to be on the radio. I was so hurt by the way they were treating him.

'As sick as he was, the fact he could even stand on that stage because they had to do a show Sunday afternoon as well as Sunday evening.

'But George was not going to let anyone down.'

One of Louise's favorite memories was getting to know John, Paul and Ringo's personalities intimately.

She fondly thinks back to those good times as if she'd found three new siblings.

She says: 'It was like getting three more brothers. They were really nice, down-to-earth. They never acted like they were big shots. They were just real, normal people.

'John has this kind of caustic sarcasm, I told my mum: ""I don't think John likes me very much. He is kind of a bit snippy towards me.""

'My mom said,""'No, no, that is just his protective wall that he has. He has been so badly hurt since he was a little child. His father abandoned them. His mother took off and then finally when he was in his teenage years was killed in front of his eyes, so that devil may care attitude of being snippy and everything is just his shield that he wears"".

'Once she told me that, and I understood it, I was able to get along with him fine.

'Paul was always the one, like if there was a crowd of people wanting autographs or pictures, would stay the longest. He would go to the most trouble to accommodate the fans.

'Ringo was just a happy-go-lucky kind of guy. He just fit in with whatever everyone else was doing.

'When it was the four of them, he was the one they would joke about. Someone once said to them, ""With all of the adulation, don't you sometimes think of yourselves as Gods?"" John replied: ""Whenever we feel like that we just look at Ringo!""

'He was always the one they would make fun of, and he accepted that was his role. To be the butt of the joke. He didn't mind that either. It was not meant unkindly, but with love and affection.'

As the Beatles became a global phenomenon and the number-one records piled up, so the band members' bank accounts swelled.

Louise saw a change in George's life, one that he talked about with her.

'As he became wealthy all of the predators came out of the woodwork and some of them actually became wives,' she said. 'That soured him a little bit.

Louise manages the cover band out of Branson, Missouri, where the band often plays at Caravelle Theatre

'As he said to me, ""Initially when people make a lot of money they are regarded as tycoons, we are just regarded as targets"".

'We talked for years and years. He knew I was one person he could talk to because I taught him how to talk and how to walk.

'As a big sister, he had total trust in me. I had always been there to put my hand out to help him.'

Fans all around the world were devastated when the Beatles officially broke up in 1970.

'It was just time, Louise says. 'It had become such a burden for them to try to be together and do things together. They lived in their own houses and were no longer close to each other. They were married, had kids and wanted their own lives.

'Paul once made the comment, ""Those wedding bells are breaking up the old gang of mine"", and in a way he was right. It evolved, it went its course, and went out again. It had a beginning, middle and end.'

Today Louise is still linked to The Fab Four, managing a successful Beatles tribute act called the Liverpool Legends in Branson, Missouri.

Should George have not died from lung cancer on November 29, 2001, he would've been 73 years old.

51816,https://www.wired.com/2015/09/apple-tv-web/,2015-09-15 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.wired.com,,"Published on 2015-09-15 13:09:25+00:00.  The next-generation Apple  TV will feature many tricks that its predecessors did not: games, a full suite of apps, a touch-sensitive remote, and more. Equally interesting, though, is what it will be lacking. Specifically, the new Apple TV closes off a direct conduit to the Web—and all the annoyances that come with it. As  pointed out  late last week by iOS developer Daniel Pasco, tvOS has been stripped of WebKit and UIWebview, two tools that combined allow developers to easily tap into a “webview” for select content, like when you followed a link to this story from within your iPhone’s Twitter app. That will potentially make life harder for the developers who use webviews as shortcuts; the ability to pull in existing elements from the Web to round out your app means you don’t need intimate knowledge of sometimes labyrinthine software developer kits (SDKs). That’s a more standard practice than you might realize. “Webviews traditionally have been used as an easy way to render complex content, like styled text views with embedded imagery, or magazine-style layouts,” explains Steven Troughton-Smith, founder and CEO of High Caffeine Content and prominent iOS developer. “In this sense, webviews are incredibly common, and whole classes of apps would have to rethink how they display content.” “You’d be hard-pressed to find a large number of apps that don’t have them,” agrees Forrester Research analyst Michael Facemire. “It’s simply nice to reuse assets on the Web, even if they’re small assets like a log-in screen, or some success or error messaging.” Having to rethink elements, even the small workarounds, means headaches for developers. Losing the Web also means the loss of a few perks like OAuth authorization, which you encounter every time you use your Facebook account to log into a non-Facebook site. Proponents of openness at all cost may be aghast, since shutting out the Web means the Apple TV’s walled garden won’t even allow the occasional visitor. You can kiss your RSS reader goodbye. The list of negatives, though, ends right about there. Here’s what you get in return. No WebKit, No Problem The Web can be a wonderful place, but it can also be awful, and not even in that 4chan kind of way. Flash ads and CSS farts are bad enough on the desktop or phone; on a television, they’re a full-blown nightmare. And that’s before you remember that while Apple TV’s tvOS shares plenty of DNA with iOS, the user interactions couldn’t be more different. Instead of tapping and swiping a 4.7-inch display with your fingers, you’re using a remote to control a 55-inch digital tapestry from 10 feet away. It’s like trying to play a banjo with two oven mitts on. “How would you interact with a webpage rendered in a webview with the Apple TV remote?” asks Adam Grossman, developer of popular iOS weather app Dark Sky. “Including it would cause all sorts of potential problems, I’d imagine.” Grossman says he has no plans on taking Dark Sky to Apple TV “just yet,” for now focusing instead on Apple Watch and iPhone. He does, though, feel that webviews often aren’t the right answer no matter what the platform. “My opinion is: If you’re making a native app, use the native SDKs,” he says. “Otherwise it’s going to be a crummy experience.” Remember, too, that there’s more than one flavor of crummy when it comes to app interactions. Banging a remote against your forehead in frustration over an unnavigable UI is one; another is apps that are simply shoddy. You know, like those that already populate the legions of lackluster “smart TV.” “Website content…would allow developers to take the least-common-denominator approach to bring existing, awful, Web-based ‘smart TV’ apps or sites to tvOS,” says Troughton-Smith. “They could just reuse anything they’ve built already, instead of putting care and attention into creating something appropriate for the platform.” By discouraging those “least-common-denominator” experiences, Apple can preemptively ensure that the population of its App Store’s TV section comprises dedicated developers, working with the Apple TV specifically in mind. For the user, it’s the difference between mass-produced cafeteria mystery meat and a custom-cut filet. Developers that do have to put in a little won’t find it quite so onerous as one might think. “It’s semantics,” says Facemire, himself a longtime software developer at IBM. “You have to learn a wee little bit, and there are probably some quality control testing nuances you’d have to consider.” Those restraints might make some apps slower to market, but once they get there, they’ll be best in class because of it. “For users, this is a great thing,” explains Troughton-Smith, who plans on building apps for tvOS. “At the very least, apps should be faster, more pleasant to use, and crash less (WebKit content uses a lot of RAM and resources).” Ready to Launch Even beyond the obvious end user benefits, the simplest explanation for the new Apple TV’s want of Web might simply be that including it would have left too much to chance. Above and beyond speed and interface and resource concerns, the Web is simply too unpredictable. The new Apple TV is the company’s most high-profile launch—more of a reboot, but still—in years. We’re reportedly a few months away, pending  seemingly endless negotiations , from a hallmark live, streaming, over the top TV service. Forgive Apple if it’s a little uptight about with whom it shares its sandbox. That helps explain why WebKit’s not the only tool that didn’t make the jump from iOS 9 to tvOS. You won’t find iAds on your Apple TV, or push notifications, or MapKit, or HealthKit, or social integrations from Twitter. At least, not yet. “I think Apple’s figuring out what would make a great first experience for this brand-new platform, to try and show that it has a place,” says Troughton-Smith. “I think Apple wants to make sure that their next initial offering in this space is incredibly solid, has a great user experience,” Facemire agrees. The more moving parts you start with, the more things can break. If, instead, you begin with a solid foundation and build piece by piece from there, you’ve got a much better chance at success. “If you think about it,” Facemire continues, “when the iPhone first came out, there wasn’t even an App Store.” Besides, if anyone for any reason desperately wants to browse the Web on their television set, they’re just an AirPlay mirroring session away. So yes, we’ll probably see ads and calorie counts and maps at some point in Apple TV’s future. The Web? Maybe not so much. Not until it’s built not for our keyboards and fingers but for a five-button remote. Not unless it suddenly turns interlinked chaos into order and predictability. When that happens, you might find the Web on your Apple TV. But by then, it’s unlikely you’d recognize it.",2023-10-26 22:12:04.398970+00:00,True,False,,,,Be Happy the New Apple TV Ditches the Web - WIRED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Users complaining that their iPhones have slowed down after updating to the latest iOS 9 software may not be imagining it.

The new iOS 9 operating system works on models from 2011’s iPhone 4s onwards, with the company claiming that more than 50% of iOS users had already installed the update within a week of its release.

However, some users of Apple’s official discussion forums are already criticising the impact on their older handsets.

Videos from vloggers iAppleBytes directly comparing the latest iOS 9.0.1 software to iOS 8.4.1 running on an iPhone 4S, 5 and 5S have also demonstrated a noticeable amount of slowdown with the new update.



iOS 9 compared to iOS 8 on an iPhone 4S.

The smartphones take longer to start up, camera performance is slower, as is launching apps and switching between them.

Some actions take a very similar amount of time, particularly on the newer iPhones. The performance of Apple’s virtual assistant Siri actually seems to be slightly faster, although some users within Apple’s forums have disabled Siri’s new app prediction features in an attempt to speed up the rest of the phone.

The issue of new software slowing down older phones is familiar to smartphone owners. New features demand more resources from the device, and can therefore slow down normal operations and affect battery life.

iOS 9 compared to iOS 8 on an iPhone 5.

Some updates – Google’s Android Lollipop in 2014 for example – focus on performance and optimisation, and can actually improve the speed of the smartphone or tablet they are installed on.

This does not appear to be the case with iOS 9, although in other ways, it has been one of the smoothest annual updates for Apple’s devices.

On its release in 2014, iOS 8 caused issues for people upgrading because it demanded a 5GB of free of space meaning many had to delete music, apps and photos from their devices just to install the update.

Apple corrected the issue with iOS 9 requiring under 1.5GB of space, and providing support for smaller applications, but its impact on the speed of older devices is evident.

While some users will try and avoid updating to the latest version of iOS, it could put them at risk of security vulnerabilities and will eventually stop being supported by the latest apps, making an upgrade inevitable at some point.",2023-10-26 22:13:37.428530+00:00,True,True,True,,0.8820062608381055,iOS9 making your iPhone slow?

While the rest of the world engaged in merriment and good cheer, hackers used the holidays to attack a United States research group that puts out a daily newsletter on security issues.  On Saturday, hackers who say they are members of the collective known as Anonymous claimed responsibility for crashing the Web site of the group, Stratfor Global Intelligence Service, and pilfering its client list, e-mails and credit card information in an operation they say is intended to steal $1 million for donations to charity. The hackers posted a list online that they say contains Stratfor’s confidential client list as well as credit card details, passwords and home addresses for some 4,000 Stratfor clients. The hackers also said they had details for more than 90,000 credit card accounts. Among the organizations listed as Stratfor clients: Bank of America, the Defense Department, Doctors Without Borders, Lockheed Martin, Los Alamos National Laboratory and the United Nations. The group also posted five receipts online that it said were of donations made with pilfered credit card details. One receipt showed a $180 donation from a United States Homeland Security employee, Edmund H. Tupay, to the American Red Cross. Another showed a $200 donation to the Red Cross from Allen Barr, a recently retired employee from the Texas Department of Banking. Neither responded to requests for comment.  Mr. Barr told The Associated Press that on Friday he discovered that $700 had been transferred from his account to charities including the Red Cross, Save the Children and CARE, but that he had not been aware that the transfer was tied to a breach of Stratfor’s site.  Stratfor executives did not return calls for comment on Sunday. In an e-mail to subscribers Sunday morning, Stratfor’s chief executive, George Friedman, confirmed that the company’s site had been hacked and said his company was working with law enforcement to track down the parties responsible. Image Pfc. Bradley Manning, a suspect in information leaks. Credit... Patrick Semansky/Associated Press “We have reason to believe that the names of our corporate subscribers have been posted on other Web sites,” Mr. Friedman wrote in the e-mail. “We are diligently investigating the extent to which subscriber information may have been obtained.” The hackers took responsibility for the Stratfor attack on Twitter and said the attack would be the beginning of a weeklong holiday hacking spree. The breach was the latest in the online group’s ongoing campaign of computer attacks which, to date, has been aimed at MasterCard, Visa and PayPal as well as groups as diverse as the Church of Scientology, the Motion Picture Association of America and the Zetas, a Mexican crime syndicate.  The breach first surfaced on Saturday when hackers defaced Stratfor’s Web site with their own message. “Merry Lulzxmas!” the group wrote in a reference to Lulz Security, a hacking group loosely affiliated with Anonymous. “Are you ready for a week of mayhem?” By Sunday afternoon, the message had been replaced with a banner message that said: “Site is currently undergoing maintenance. Please check back soon.”  According to the hackers’ online postings, the group voted on what charities to contribute to. Among their choices were cancer and AIDS research, the American Red Cross, WikiLeaks and the Tor Project, a software that enables online anonymity. Also according to their postings, the breach appears to have been conducted in retaliation for the arrest and imprisonment of Pfc. Bradley Manning, the Army intelligence analyst on trial on charges of leaking classified intelligence information and more than 250,000 diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks last year.  The attack was also likely intended to embarrass Stratfor, which specializes in intelligence and security. The hackers said they were able to obtain the credit card details because, they said, Stratfor had failed to encrypt them.  “The scary thing is that no matter what you do, every system has some level of vulnerability,” says Jerry Irvine, a member of the National Cyber Security Task Force. “The more you do from an advanced technical standpoint, the more common things go unnoticed.

'Anonymous' hacks thousands of credit cards from security firm for charity donations... and vows to strike AGAIN



Online military supply store is the next intended target

The loose-knit hacking movement 'Anonymous', who claimed to have used victims' credit cards to donate to charity, said the stunt was just the beginning of their masterplan.



Thousands of credit card numbers and other personal information belonging to clients of U.S.-based security think tank Stratfor has been hacked, the organisation said.



Some victims confirmed unauthorised transactions linked to their credit cards. Anonymous boasted of stealing Stratfor's confidential client list, which includes entities ranging from Apple Inc. to the U.S. Air Force to the Miami Police Department, and mining it for more than 4,000 credit card numbers, passwords and home addresses.

Stolen: Hacking group 'Anonymous' is set to publish 2.7 million emails sent from Stratfor's global network of sources

In a statement released today, Anonymous said: 'Tomorrow, we will be dropping another enormous dump on our next target: the entire customer database from an online military and law enforcement supply store.'

A tweet from @AnonymousIRC read : '#Antisec has enough targets lined up to extend the fun fun fun of #LulzXmas throught the entire next week.'



The hackers added that Stratfor were 'clueless' when it came to database security. The global intelligence firm's website is currently shutdown and undergoing maintenance.



Stratfor is also helping in an investigation with the FBI.

Austin, Texas-based Stratfor provides political, economic and military analysis to help clients reduce risk, according to a description on its YouTube page.



It charges subscribers for its reports and analysis, delivered through the web, emails and videos.



Proprietary information about the companies and government agencies that subscribe to Stratfor's newsletters did not appear to be at any significant risk, however, with the main threat posed to individual employees who had subscribed.



'Not so private and secret anymore?' Anonymous taunted in a message on Twitter, promising that the attack on Stratfor was just the beginning of a Christmas-inspired assault on a long list of targets.

Promising more: Anonymous recently hacked into think-tank Stratfor pictured above, and stole thousands of emails

Anonymous said the client list it had already posted was a small slice of the 200 gigabytes worth of plunder it stole from Stratfor and promised more leaks.



It said it was able to get the credit card details in part because Stratfor didn't bother encrypting them — an easy-to-avoid blunder which, if true, would be a major embarrassment for any security-related company.



Fred Burton, Stratfor's vice president of intelligence, said the company had reported the intrusion to law enforcement and was working with them on the investigation.



Stratfor has protections in place meant to prevent such attacks, he said.



'But I think the hackers live in this kind of world where once they fixate on you or try to attack you it's extraordinarily difficult to defend against,' Burton said.



Hours after publishing what it claimed was Stratfor's client list, Anonymous tweeted a link to encrypted files online with names, phone numbers, emails, addresses and credit card account details.



'Not as many as you expected? Worry not, fellow pirates and robin hoods. These are just the 'A's,' read a message posted online that encouraged readers to download a file of the hacked information.

The attack is 'just another in a massive string of breaches we've seen this year and in years past,' said Josh Shaul, chief technology officer of Application Security Inc., a New York-based provider of database security software.



Donated: The American Red Cross, among other nonprofits, received some of the money stolen by Anonymous as a donation for the holiday season

Still, companies that shared secret information with Stratfor in order to obtain threat assessments might worry that the information is among the 200 gigabytes of data that Anonymous claims to have stolen, he said.



'If an attacker is walking away with that much email, there might be some very juicy bits of information that they have,' Shaul said.



Lt. Col. John Dorrian, public affairs officer for the Air Force, said that 'for obvious reasons' the Air Force doesn't discuss specific vulnerabilities, threats or responses to them.



'The Air Force will continue to monitor the situation and, as always, take appropriate action as necessary to protect Air Force networks and information,' he said in an email.



Miami Police Department spokesman Sgt. Freddie Cruz Jr. said that he could not confirm that the agency was a client of Stratfor, and he said he had not received any information about a security breach involving the police department.



Anonymous also linked to images online that it suggested were receipts for charitable donations made by the group manipulating the credit card data it stole.



'Thank you! Defense Intelligence Agency,' read the text above one image that appeared to show a transaction summary indicating that an agency employee's information was used to donate $250 to a non-profit.



One receipt — to the American Red Cross — had Allen Barr's name on it.



Barr, of Austin, Texas, recently retired from the Texas Department of Banking and said he discovered last Friday that a total of $700 had been spent from his account.



Barr, who has spent more than a decade dealing with cybercrime at banks, said five transactions were made in total.



'It was all charities, the Red Cross, CARE, Save the Children. So when the credit card company called my wife she wasn't sure whether I was just donating,' said Barr, who wasn't aware until a reporter with the AP called that his information had been compromised when Stratfor's computers were hacked.



'It made me feel terrible. It made my wife feel terrible. We had to close the account.'



Wishing everyone a 'Merry LulzXMas' — a nod to its spinoff hacking group Lulz Security — Anonymous also posted a link on Twitter to a site containing the email, phone number and credit number of a U.S. Homeland Security employee.



The employee, Cody Sultenfuss, said he had no warning before his details were posted.



'They took money I did not have,' he told The Associated Press in a series of emails, which did not specify the amount taken. 'I think 'Why me?' I am not rich.'



But the breach doesn't necessarily pose a risk to owners of the credit cards. A card user who suspects fraudulent activity on his or her card can contact the credit card company to dispute the charge.



Stratfor said in an email to members that it had suspended its servers and email after learning that its website had been hacked.



'We have reason to believe that the names of our corporate subscribers have been posted on other web sites,' said the email, signed by Stratfor Chief Executive George Friedman and passed on to AP by subscribers. 'We are diligently investigating the extent to which subscriber information may have been obtained.'



'Stratfor's relationship with its members and, in particular, the confidentiality of their subscriber information, are very important to Stratfor and me,' Friedman wrote.



One member of the hacking group, who uses the handle AnonymousAbu on Twitter, claimed that more than 90,000 credit cards from law enforcement, the intelligence community and journalists — 'corporate/exec accounts of people like Fox' News — had been hacked and used to 'steal a million dollars' and make donations.



It was impossible to verify where credit card details were used. Fox News was not on the excerpted list of Stratfor members posted online, but other media organizations including MSNBC and Al-Jazeera English appeared in the file.



Anonymous warned it has 'enough targets lined up to extend the fun fun fun of LulzXmas through the entire next week.'

Google's Gmail service went down for about 20 minutes on Monday. That was annoying, but not exactly unprecedented. These sorts of outages  happen all the time . What was strange is that the Gmail outage coincided with widespread reports that Google's Chrome browser was also crashing. Late Monday, Google engineer Tim Steele confirmed what developers had been suspecting. He said that the crashes were affecting Chrome users who were using another Google web service known as Sync, and that Sync and other Google services -- presumably Gmail too -- were clobbered Monday when Google misconfigured its load-balancing servers. Sync is essentially Google's answer to Apple's iCloud. It's a software service built by Google to unshackle web surfers from their own desktops. It works in the background, shuttling information between the Chrome browser and Google's servers, so that people users who log into Google can get at their bookmarks, extensions, and apps -- no matter what computer they're using to surf the web. But on Monday, Steele  wrote in a developer discussion forum , a problem with Google's Sync servers kicked off an error on the browser, which made Chrome abruptly shut down on the desktop. ""It's due to a backend service that sync servers depend on becoming overwhelmed, and sync servers responding to that by telling all clients to throttle all data types,"" Steele said. That ""throttling"" messed up things in the browser, causing it to crash. The problems were short-lived, but widespread. Over at Hacker News -- a news discussion site that tends to attract Silicon Valley's most knowledgeable software developers -- a  long thread quickly filled up with dozens of crash reports . ""My Chrome has been crashing every ten minutes for the last half hour,"" wrote one poster. This may be a first. Bad webpage coding can often cause a browser to crash, but yesterday's crash looks like something different: widespread crashing kicked off by a web service designed to help drive your browser. Think of it as the flip side of cloud computing. Google's pitch has always been that its servers are easier to use and less error-prone than buggy desktop software. But the Sync problem shows that when Google goes down, it can not only keep you from getting your e-mail -- it can knock desktop software such as a browser offline too. Chrome prides itself on ""sandboxing"" itself, so that a problem with a single webpage can only crash a tab in the browser, and not bring down the entire program. But that's just what happened with Monday's bug. It clobbered the entire browser. ""That's definitely a big and unusual problem because if the browser shuts down, that's a failure of the whole model of Chromium itself,' says Kevin Quennesson, CTO of online photo service Everpix. ""When you bridge authentication and identity and the cloud to a desktop application, you then get occasionally these very weird failures,"" says David Ulevicth, the founder of OpenDNS, a cloud-based infrastructure services company. It's the kind of issue that could pop up more often as developers work to build browsers such as Rockmelt that do more than simply surf the web, says Michael Mahemoff, a former Google Chrome team member who is now the founder of podcast app-maker Player FM. ""People are trying to integrate more identity and these kind of sync service and social services,"" he says. It's also something that cloud service providers are going to have to worry about more and more, as services such as Apple's iCloud and Windows Live get more closely intertwined with our phones and PCs. ""As you centralize things like authentication and identity to one provider, then when that one provider has a hiccup the impact can be far-reaching,"" says Ulevicth. ""Imagine a scenario where you can't even open your Android phone or you can't get phone calls on Google Voice. it's not just your browser.""

Story highlights Apple's fingerprint sensor on the iPhone 5S doesn't always work the way it should Some iPhones don't approve fingerprints they're supposed to approve Sensor is susceptible to problems caused by dust, moisture, and electrostatic discharge, User error could also be causing some people's issues with the Touch ID system

CNN —

Apple’s fingerprint sensor, Touch ID, is the flagship feature on the iPhone 5S. But it doesn’t always work the way it should.

Since the sensor’s introduction in September, a growing number of issues have surfaced — including everything from phones that don’t recognize when a finger is present to those that don’t approve fingerprints they’re supposed to approve.

What’s going on here? While faulty software or hardware could be to blame in a few cases, the problem might also be you. Determining the real culprit requires a closer look at how Apple’s sensor technology really works.

Touch ID is composed of an 8 x 8 millimeter, 170-micron-thick capacitive sensor located just beneath the home button on the 5s. This is used to capture a 500-pixel-per-inch (ppi) resolution image of your fingerprint. The sensor can read pores, ridges, and valleys. It can identify arches, loops, and whorls. It can even recognize fingerprints oriented in any direction.

When you place your finger or thumb on the sensor, it looks at the fingerprint pattern on the conductive sub-dermis layer of skin located underneath the dermis layer. It also measures the differences in conductivity between the tops of the ridges and the bottoms of the valleys in your prints in this layer. This is more accurate than looking at the dead surface of the skin alone, which is constantly changing and isn’t conductive.

This capacitive sensor is made of raw silicon. As such, it tends to be very fragile and susceptible to performance problems caused by dust, moisture, and electrostatic discharge, or ESD. To protect and insulate the sensor, Apple layered laser-cut sapphire crystal on top of the silicon.

It chose sapphire for a few reasons. The material is very clear, and it acts as a lens for your fingerprint. It’s also hard (it scores a 9 on the Mohs scale of hardness), which means it’s difficult to scratch. If the home button does get scraped or scuffed, the images sent to the Touch ID sensor will be flawed and it will cease to work properly.

What’s more, a stainless steel ring encircles the button and acts as a capacitive touch switch, turning the actual touch sensor on and off when a finger is present so it doesn’t eat up your iPhone’s battery life.

Which Should You Buy: Xbox One or PlayStation 4?

After you register your fingerprint — a process known as enrolling — an encrypted mathematical representation of that information is stored on the device’s A7 processor in what’s called the “secure enclave.” When the sensor captures an image, software algorithms determine whether the print is a match with the stored information or not. A match allows access to the homescreen. A non-match won’t.

There are obviously a few possible points of failure in this process, but it all hinges on first getting that robust fingerprint data. “Any good biometric has to start with a high-quality image,” Integrated Biometrics’ CEO Steve Thies told Wired. His company makes a variety of compact fingerprint sensors that use a different method from Apple’s Touch ID (electroluminescence and a thin film transistor) to read fingerprints.

Basically, the larger the sensor, the easier it is to pick up a more accurate representation of your full fingerprint because it’s working with more data. This makes it easier for recognition algorithms to confirm that your fingerprint actually belongs to you. But a larger sensor also introduces two problems: cost, in the case of a capacitive scanner like Apple’s, and thickness, in the case of another popular fingerprint technology, optical sensing. (You’ve probably used the latter at the DMV or gym.)

The 13 Best Movies You Didn’t See in 2013

Based on what we’ve seen from Apple’s patent applications, it’s highly likely the company considered other implementations of a touch sensor. But ultimately, it opted for a smaller version that could more easily fit inside the home button.

Apple partially gets around the small sensor issue using the enrollment process, which includes rolling your finger around to try to capture every microscopic nook and cranny on your finger. Then, at least, it has a large source to pull from, even if it’s only scanning a section of that each time you tap your finger.

Still, the less data you have from a fingerprint to process, the harder it is to get a match. Precise Biometrics COO Patrik Lindeberg offers a good analogy: If you have a picture of a face and you see only a small part of that picture — the eyes, or part of one eye — it will be hard to recognize if it is a friend, or someone you don’t know. If you have the full face, it’s easy to process. Seeing only a portion of a fingerprint sets higher and higher requirements on software algorithms, Lindeberg says.

Indeed, the more sensitive the algorithm (to get a more exact match), the more false-negatives (failed when it should have passed) are produced, which may frustrate a valid user, according to Kevin Luowitz, CTO of biometric identity service startup CLEAR.

“The challenge is then to find that happy balance of acceptable false-negatives and false-positives and user experience,” Luowitz says. For security’s sake, you would want the algorithm to veer towards false-negatives rather than false-positives.

Apple’s Touch ID algorithm is designed to learn and improve over time — with each scan, it checks if it is a better reading than what is stored, and can update the master data for your print this way. This algorithm could certainly be changed or improved through iOS updates, as well.

User error, and a lack of knowledge about biometrics and how they work, could also be causing some people’s issues with Touch ID.

“A lot of us in the industry, we are very impressed by the job Apple has done with Touch ID,” Lindeberg said. “But on the consumer side, a lot of people have never used biometrics at all.”

There are a variety of small things that could be going on to interrupt a successful Touch ID experience. First, for it to work properly, your finger needs to make contact not just with the sapphire of the home button, but also the stainless steel ring surrounding it.

Next, the sensor itself works by measuring electrical differences between the ridges and valleys of your fingerprints. If your hands are too dry, it’s going to be difficult for your print to be recognized (this could be a growing problem in the dry winter months ahead). Conversely, if your fingers are too moist or oily, recognition can also fail, as those valleys get filled. If the button gets dirty, as it likely will over time, you’ll also want to clean it to keep Touch ID working properly. Apple suggests using a clean, lint-free cloth.

But what about that touch sensor itself? Some have worried that, like traditional capacitive-based fingerprint sensors, it will degrade over time. Thies of Integrated Biometrics thinks that as long as the sapphire crystal and metal ring are not damaged and are properly sealed, the sensor should last the life of the phone. Capacitive sensors in the past were unprotected, or covered in a very thin layer of carbon, and thus were very fragile.

The Best Map Ever Made of America’s Racial Segregation

For those experiencing Touch ID issues that cause their phone to freeze, or to not work as well over time, restarting the phone or recalibrating the sensor are your best bets. And if you’re new to Touch ID or having trouble, Apple also has a guide you can reference for help.

Fingerprint sensors may not be a new technology. But Touch ID is certainly a new implementation of it. It’s bound to experience some bumps as Apple tweaks its algorithms, and as users get accustomed to using biometrics on a daily basis.

At the very least, by understanding how it works and the inherent pitfalls of fingerprint sensors, we can help minimize those issues ourselves.",2023-10-28 08:53:07.651765+00:00,True,True,True,,0.9048959434647036,The trouble with Apple's Touch ID fingerprint reader - CNN,,"The software failure incident occurred with Apple's Touch ID, the fingerprint sensor on the iPhone 5S.

Leaked CIA documents have revealed the agency has been hacking people's Wi-Fi routers and using them as covert listening points.

Infected routers are used to spy on the activity of internet-connected device, according to decade-old secret documents leaked on Thursday by Wikileaks.

Home routers from 10 US manufacturers, including Linksys, DLink, and Belkin, have been used by the CIA to monitor internet traffic.

Home routers from 10 US manufacturers, including Linksys, DLink, and Belkin, have been used by the CIA to monitor internet traffic. Pictured is a list of some of the routers vulnerable to the agency's 'CherryBlossom' implant

THE CHERRYBLOSSOM WI-FI HACK Once installed, CherryBlossom turns the device into a 'Flytrap' that sends messages to a CIA-controlled server known as 'CherryTree'. The Flytrap sends the router's device status and security information, which CherryTree logs to a database. The CherryTree server then sends the infected device a 'mission' with specific tasks tailored to the target. A web-based user interface known as 'CherryWeb' is used by CIA operators to check the Flytrap's status and web traffic and to assign the infected device new missions. Missions assigned to the Flytrap can target specific laptops or phones in the house based on IP and email addresses, chat user names and MAC addresses. Mission tasks include copying some or all of the user's internet traffic, email exchanges and private chat usernames. Advertisement

Wikileaks released the entire 175-page CIA user manual for the implant, which is codenamed 'CherryBlossom'.

In total, the manual says that the firmware runs on 25 router models, but could run on more than 100 with minor modifications.

'The Cherry Blossom (CB) system provides a means of monitoring the internet activity of and performing software exploits on targets of interest,' the document reads.

'In particular, CB is focused on compromising wireless networking devices, such as wireless (802.11) routers and access points (APs), to achieve these goals.'

The firmware is especially effective against some D-Link-made DIR-130 and Linksys-manufactured WRT300N models because they can be remotely infected even if they have a strong administrator password.

An exploit codenamed 'tomato' can extract passwords from these routers if a default feature known as universal plug and play is left on.

Routers protected with a default or weak password are easily infected by the firmware, the manual says.

Once installed, CherryBlossom turns the device into a 'Flytrap' that sends messages called beacons to a CIA-controlled server known as 'CherryTree'.

The Flytrap sends the router's device status and security information, which CherryTree logs to a database.

60559,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/05/apple-error-53-sting-operation-caught-staff-misleading-customers-court-documents-allege,2017-06-04 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,,"Published on 2017-06-05 00:00:00. Australia’s consumer watchdog carried out a sting operation against Apple which it says caught staff repeatedly misleading iPhone customers about their legal rights to a free repair or replacement after a so-called “error 53” malfunction, court documents reveal.



Australian authorities lodged a high-profile case against Apple this year, after iPhone and iPad customers experienced a malfunction that rendered phones useless if it detects that a repair has been carried out by a non-Apple technician. The fault occurred between late 2014 until early last year.

The case, set to go to trial in mid-December, accuses Apple of wrongly telling customers they were not entitled to free replacements or repair if they had taken their devices to an unauthorised third-party repairer.



What is 'error 53'? 'Error 53' is a message that occurred after updating to iOS 9.0 on iPhones of people who had had their TouchID fingerprint sensor replaced by a repair shop not licensed by Apple. The phones were rendered useless because the operating system update detected a mismatch between the sensor and the phone, and locked the device, assuming unauthorised access was being attempted. Eventually, Apple issued a fix which rendered affected phones usable again, while keeping TouchID disabled on those devices.

That advice was allegedly given even where the repair – a screen replacement, for example – was not related to the fault.



Apple has so far chosen to remain silent about the case brought by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).



But court documents obtained by Guardian Australia show the company has denied the ACCC’s allegations, saying it did not mislead or cause any harm to its Australian customers.

The documents also show how the ACCC used undercover methods to investigate Apple. Investigators, posing as iPhone customers, called all 13 Apple retailers across Australia in June last year.

They told Apple staff their iPhone speakers had stopped working after screens were replaced by a third party.



Apple’s response was the same in each of the 13 calls, the ACCC alleges.

“In each call, Apple Australia represented to the ACCC caller that no Apple entity ... was required to, or would, remedy the defective speaker at no cost under the [Australian consumer law] if the screen of the iPhone had been replaced by someone other than Apple Australia or an Apple-authorised service provider,” the ACCC’s court claim alleged.

Error 53 generally occurred after a user tried to update their phone to iOS 8 or iOS 9, and affected about one in every 1,000 phones supplied by Apple or its resellers between September 2014 and February 2016.

Australian consumer law clearly protects the right of a customer to a replacement or free repair if the product is faulty or of unacceptable quality.

The ACCC has also alleged information on Apple US’s website misled customers about their rights. The website told users experiencing error 53 that: “If the screen or any other part on your iPhone or iPad was replaced somewhere else, contact Apple Support about pricing information for out-of-warranty repairs.”

Apple, in response, said the undercover calls made by the ACCC cannot be considered as breaches because consumer law does not exist in “hypothetical circumstances”.

The company said that real customers who had called the store would have received other information from Apple that informed them of their rights under consumer law.

Apple denied the message on its US website was an “express representation” that consumers were not entitled to a free replacement or repair.

Apple said the website was referring only to the conditions of the company’s own limited warranty, which existed in addition to a customer’s statutory rights.

It was only one part of the communications between the company and its customers over error 53, the company said, and must be interpreted in the broader context.

Apple said it had also established an error 53 outreach program and offered replacements or repairs for many of the phones referred to in the ACCC’s case. It also released an update in February last year to resolve the problem and restore the functionality of affected devices.

Apple has previously faced court action in the United States relating to error 53, but the case was thrown out last year.",2023-11-25 05:58:41.648941+00:00,True,True,True,,0.9372443093022447,"Apple ‘error 53’ sting operation caught staff misleading customers, court documents allege - The Guardian",,"The software failure incident, known as ""error 53,"" occurred between late 2014 and early 2016.

61280,https://www.wired.com/story/game-of-thrones-leak-hbo-hack/,2017-07-31 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.wired.com,,"Published on 2017-07-31 18:05:53.218000+00:00.  This weekend, the  same email landed in the inboxes of an untold number of entertainment journalists. “1.5 TB of HBO data just leaked!!!” screamed the subject header, while the email itself, addressed ""to all mankind,"" promised “the greatest leak of space era” and a link to a site that hosts an unreleased  Game of Thrones  script and not-yet-aired episodes of  Ballers ,   Insecure ,  Room 104 , and  Barry . According to the hackers, there’s plenty more where that came from. HBO has confirmed that an attack happened, though not the scope. “There has been a cyber incident directed at the company which has resulted in some stolen proprietary information, including some of our programming,” wrote HBO chairman and CEO Richard Plepler in an email to employees. With streaming hacks like this one, though, it remains to be seen if size correlates with impact. The Hack On Sunday morning, an email from an unnamed group—though they appear to have adopted the tagline “HBO is falling”—went out to reporters, telling them, “You are lucky to be the first pioneers to witness and download the leak. Enjoy it & spread the words.” In addition to the link mentioned above, the email also included contact information for HBO communications VP Jeff Cusson. Details of the hack itself are scarce, and HBO declined to comment on what it deemed an ongoing investigation. But unlike other recent high-profile Hollywood hacks, which relied on  lax third-party security systems , the HBO hackers claim to have compromised HBO itself. Related Stories Streaming That  Orange Is the New Black  Leak Was Never Going to Pay Off Brian Barrett Hacks High-Profile Extortion Hacks Aren't Paying Off Lily Hay Newman Security Sony Got Hacked Hard: What We Know and Don't Know So Far Kim Zetter “We successfully penetrated HBO’s huge network and gathered most imporatnt [sic] files and films & scripts and so on,” one of the hackers wrote in an email to WIRED, promising both full episodes of  Game of Thrones  and upcoming feature films (presumably HBO originals). The hacker, identified in the email as “Mr. Smith,” also claimed to have “obtained alot [sic] about HBO’s staff and internal stuff.” None of this has been verified, and hackers frequently overstate their claims. If true, though, this may ultimately resemble the  Sony hack of 2014  more than Netflix’s recent  Orange Is the New Black  leak— which would be especially troubling for HBO . Who’s Affected? Well, HBO for starters. The casts, crews, and creators of the various series that ended up online. And any fans desperate enough to get a sneak peek at  Ballers  that they would download a file from a hacker-hosted website (or, likely soon enough, torrent it). In truth, the answer to this question depends enough on the next question that we’ll get right into it. How Serious Is This? The leaking of unreleased shows has proven in the past to be, well, not that serious. It’s not ideal! But as pirated content continues to fall out of favor—BitTorrent traffic is about a fifth of what it was in 2011, according to network-equipment company Sandvine—the impact of shows leaking in the murkier depths of the internet has proven muted. HBO knows that as well as anyone; in 2015, nearly half of  Game of Thrones ’ season five landed online ahead of its television debut. Even so, that season’s premiere set a record at the time for viewership, with an audience just shy of 8 million. Similarly, there’s no reason to expect that obscure online availability will do much to crimp either  Insecure  or  Ballers . The eventual scope could differentiate this leak, though. As the Sony hack demonstrated, internal emails can do serious financial and reputational damage, both to a company in general and individuals within it. Airing dirty laundry has a higher ceiling for harm than airing  Room 104 . The hackers don’t appear to have asked for money (although what conversations they may have had, if any, with HBO prior to the release are unknown), which implies that, short of law enforcement action, there may not be a way to prevent future leaks. In which case the most important remaining question may not be how much data is left to leak but what kind.

The US Army  has increasingly used  small consumer drones in the field , purchasing them as needed from consumer manufacturers like the well-known Chinese maker DJI. But documents indicate that the Army Aviation Directorate is now enforcing new orders, banning DJI  drones  “due to increased awareness of cyber vulnerabilities associated with DJI products.” The documents, first  obtained  by Small UAS News, don’t explain the Army’s security concern, but refer to classified studies about DJI drones that first went out at the end of May. Previously, hackers have been able to jailbreak some DJI drones to control and modify things like safety features on the devices. Some reports have also indicated that DJI can gather location, audio, and even visual data from user flights. It's unclear what data DJI can access without customer consent, but location and media data from an Army drone could potentially reveal extensive information about US military operations. Even if the Army isn't specifically concerned about DJI or the Chinese government accessing this data, it may be worried that other parties could intercept any data linked to DJI. An Army spokesperson told WIRED in a statement, “We can confirm that guidance was issued; however, we are currently reviewing the guidance and cannot comment further at this time.” The guidance points to two US military reports, one from the Army Research Laboratory titled “DJI UAS Technology Threat and User Vulnerabilities” and one from the Navy called “Operational Risks with Regards to DJI Family of Products."" DJI has  said  in the past that it doesn’t track devices, and can’t access unit audio or video feeds. But the company is at least able to make its drones comply with no fly zones around the world, one of the administrative capabilities that has motivated customers to  hack the drones  in the past. Drone owners have even developed  jailbreaks  for DJI devices so they can override safety controls like flight elevation maximums. DJI says that how much information it can access about a particular user hinges on what data sharing that customer has granted, particularly through DJI mobile apps. An April 2016  privacy policy  notes that “DJI Products and Services connect to servers hosted in the United States, China, and Hong Kong.” LEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to  Drones “DJI makes civilian drones for peaceful purposes,” a DJI spokesperson said in a statement. “We do not market our products for military customers, and if military members choose to buy and use our products as the best way to accomplish their tasks, we have no way of knowing who they are or what they do with them. The US Army has not explained why it suddenly banned the use of DJI drones and components, what ‘cyber vulnerabilities’ it is concerned about, or whether it has also excluded drones made by other manufacturers.” Though the Army’s specific concerns about DJI remain unknown, the situation is reminiscent of mounting international suspicion over state use of consumer products developed abroad. These tensions have particularly escalated between the US and Russia in the past few years, with Moscow routinely  demanding  access to software source code to check security products from US companies like IBM and Cisco. Recently the US government has angled for similar access from the Russian antivirus maker Kaspersky Lab. Cybersecurity defense tools would be a particular liability if they were sabotaged by foreign adversaries, but any digital product that generates or accesses sensitive data—like, say, a military drone—is a potential weakness. Although DJI is a Chinese company, the Army may be more concerned about broad exposure to data hijacking, if the wording of the directive gives any clues. ""Cease all use, uninstall all DJI applications, remove all batteries/storage media from devices, and secure equipment for follow on direction,"" the missive reads. Its comprehensive nature may indicate fears about data interception or spyware, or could stem from a military penetration test into DJI equipment that unearthed a bug the Army doesn't want others finding and exploiting. That wouldn't be without precedent; in the late 2000s, terrorists famously  intercepted  unencrypted predator drone video feeds. It wouldn't necessarily be surprising if the US military concluded that a consumer-grade product was inadequate for military use. As DJI itself notes, the company's drones aren't made with warfare in mind, and mainstream products generally aren't hardened the way military technology is. But the thoroughness of the Army's DJI recall certainly raises questions about what specifically they found—and whether consumer privacy or security could be at risk as well.",2023-11-25 11:38:22.792441+00:00,True,True,True,,0.8332756718131409,"Army Bans DJI Drones, Citing Security Concerns - WIRED",US Army Bans DJI Drones Due to Cyber Vulnerabilities,"The software failure incident occurred when the US Army banned the use of DJI drones due to increased awareness of cyber vulnerabilities associated with DJI products.

BERKELEY, Calif. — The house at 1310 Haskell Street does not look worthy of a bitter neighborhood war. The roof is rotting, the paint is chipping, and while the lot is long and spacious, the backyard has little beyond overgrown weeds and a garage sprouting moss. The owner was known for hoarding junk and feeding cats, and when she died three years ago the neighbors assumed that whoever bought the house would be doing a lot of work. But when the buyer turned out to be a developer, and when that developer floated a proposal to raze the building and replace it with a trio of small homes, the neighborhood erupted in protest. Most of the complaints were what you might hear about any development. People thought the homes would be too tall and fretted that more residents would mean fewer parking spots. Other objections were particular to Berkeley — like a zoning board member’s complaint that shadows from the homes might hurt the supply of locally grown food.

The proposal raised concern about building heights and parking spots, but it was in line with municipal regulations. Credit... Andrew Burton for The New York Times Whatever the specifics, what is happening in Berkeley may be coming soon to a neighborhood near you. Around the country, many fast-growing metropolitan areas are facing a brutal shortage of affordable places to live, leading to gentrification, homelessness, even disease. As cities struggle to keep up with demand, they have remade their skylines with condominium and apartment towers — but single-family neighborhoods, where low-density living is treated as sacrosanct, have rarely been part of the equation. If cities are going to tackle their affordable housing problems, economists say, that is going to have to change. But how do you build up when neighbors want down? “It’s an enormous problem, and it impacts the very course of America’s future,” said Edward Glaeser, an economist at Harvard who studies cities. Even though the Haskell Street project required no alterations to Berkeley’s zoning code, it took the developer two years and as many lawsuits to get approval. He plans to start building next year. The odyssey has become a case study in how California dug itself into a vast housing shortage — a downside, in part, of a thriving economy — and why the State Legislature is taking power from local governments to solve it. “The housing crisis was caused by the unwillingness of local governments to approve new-home building, and now they’re being held accountable,” said  Brian Hanlon , executive director of California Yimby, a housing lobbying group that is backed by the tech industry and helped plan the lawsuits. Mary Trew, a retired graphic designer who fought the project, drew the same conclusion with a different spin: “Municipalities are losing their authority.” The Missing Middle The affordable-housing crunch is a nationwide problem, but California is the superlative. The state’s median home price, at just over $500,000, is more than twice the national level and up about 60 percent from five years ago, according to Zillow. It affects the poor, the rich and everyone in between. In San Diego,  one of the worst hepatitis outbreaks  in decades has killed 20 people and was centered on the city’s growing homeless population. Across the state, middle-income workers are being pushed further to the fringes and in some cases enduring  three-hour commutes . Then there is Patterson + Sheridan, a national intellectual property law firm that has its headquarters in Houston and recently  bought a private jet  to ferry its Texas lawyers to Bay Area clients. The jet was cheaper than paying local lawyers, who expect to make enough to offset the Bay Area’s inflated housing costs. “The young people that we want to hire out there have high expectations that are hard to meet,” said Bruce Patterson, a partner at the firm. “Rent is so high they can’t even afford a car.” From the windows of a San Francisco skyscraper, the Bay Area looks as if it’s having a housing boom. There are cranes around downtown and rising glass and steel condominiums. In the San Francisco metropolitan area, housing megaprojects — buildings with 50 or more units — account for a quarter of the new housing supply, up from roughly half that level in the previous two decades, according to census data compiled by  BuildZoom , a San Francisco company that helps homeowners find contractors. Image A residential construction project in San Francisco. Apartment towers have been rising in the city, but not enough to offset a housing shortage that has produced soaring rents. Credit... Robert Galbraith/Reuters The problem is that smaller and generally more affordable quarters like duplexes and small apartment buildings, where young families get their start, are being built at a slower rate. Such projects hold vast potential to provide lots of housing — and reduce sprawl — by adding density to the rings of neighborhoods that sit close to job centers but remain dominated by larger lots and single-family homes. Neighborhoods in which single-family homes make up 90 percent of the housing stock account for a little over half the land mass in both the Bay Area and Los Angeles metropolitan areas, according to Issi Romem, BuildZoom’s chief economist. There are similar or higher percentages in virtually every American city, making these neighborhoods an obvious place to tackle the affordable-housing problem. “Single-family neighborhoods are where the opportunity is, but building there is taboo,” Mr. Romem said. As long as single-family-homeowners are loath to add more housing on their blocks, he said, the economic logic will always be undone by local politics. California is trying to change that. In September, Gov. Jerry Brown signed a sweeping package with 15 new bills designed to tame rental costs and speed construction. In addition to allotting more money for subsidized housing, the package included a bill to  speed the approval  process in cities that have fallen behind state housing goals. There was a bill to close the policy loopholes that cities use to slow growth, and there were proposals that make it easier to sue the cities most stubborn about approving new housing. “We can’t just plan for growth, we have to actually build,” said Ben Metcalf, director of the California Department of Housing and Community Development. Image Some lots in Berkeley that once were home to single-family houses now have multiple dwellings, like this three-unit development. It resembles a proposal for the site at 1310 Haskell Street. Credit... Andrew Burton for The New York Times Even with a flurry of legislation, economists are skeptical that California can dent home prices anytime soon. Housing takes years to build. And  five of the new housing bills  included a union-backed measure that requires developers to pay prevailing wages on certain projects, something that critics say will increase the cost of construction. But the bigger, thornier question is where all these new residences will go, and how hard neighbors will try to prevent them. The Haskell Street fight shows why passing laws is one thing and building is another, but also gives a glimpse of what the denser neighborhoods of the future might look like — and why lots of little buildings are more important than a few skyscrapers. Kurt’s Tomatoes The 1300 block of Haskell Street sits in a kind of transition zone between the taller buildings in downtown Berkeley and the low-rise homes scattered through the eastern hills. The neighborhood has a number of single-family homes, and the street is quiet and quasi-suburban, but there are also apartment buildings and backyard cottages that nod to the city’s denser core. A little under three years ago, a contractor named Christian Szilagy bought the property and presented the city with a proposal to demolish the house and replace it with three skinny and rectangular homes that would extend through the lot. Each would have one parking spot, a garden and about 1,500 square feet of living space. The neighbors hated it. The public discussion began when  Matthew Baran , the project architect, convened a meeting with 20 or so neighbors in the home’s backyard. A mediator joined him and later filed a three-sentence report to the city: “The applicant described the project. Not a single neighbor had anything positive to say about it. No further meetings were scheduled.” On paper, at least, there was nothing wrong with the proposal. The city’s zoning code designates the area as “R2-A,” or a mixed-density area with apartments as well as houses. Berkeley’s planning staff recommended approval. But as neighbors wrote letters, called the city and showed up at meetings holding signs that said “Protect Our Community” and “Reject 1310 Haskell Permit!,” the project quickly became politicized. One focal point was Kurt Caudle’s garden. Mr. Caudle is a brewpub manager who lives in a small house on the back side of Ms. Trew’s property (that lot has two homes, or one fewer than was proposed next door). Just outside his back door sits an oasis from the city: a quiet garden where he has a small Buddha statue and grows tomatoes, squash and greens in raised beds that he built. In letters and at city meetings, Mr. Caudle complained that the homes would obstruct sunlight and imperil the garden “on which I and my neighbors depend for food.”  Sophie Hahn , a member of the city’s Zoning Adjustments Board who now sits on the City Council, was sympathetic. “When you completely shadow all of the open space,” Ms. Hahn said during a hearing, “you really impact the ability for anybody to possibly grow food in this community.” Image Kurt Caudle, a neighbor of 1310 Haskell, grows tomatoes, squash and greens outside his back door. He worries that denser development on the adjoining lot could obstruct sunlight for his garden. Credit... Andrew Burton for The New York Times The debate was easy to caricature, a textbook example of what housing advocates are talking about when they decry the not-in-my-backyard, or Nimby, attitude. Reality is more nuanced. As cities become magnets for high-paying jobs and  corporate headquarters , there has been a backlash of anti-development sentiment and a push for protections like  rent control . Home prices in the ZIP code surrounding the 1300 block of Haskell Street have just about doubled over the past five years, to an average of about $900,000, according to Zillow. Those numbers are terrifying to people like L.C. Stephens, 67, who is retired from the state corrections department. Mr. Stephens pays $1,600 to live in a modest apartment complex that was built in 1963 and sits just a few lots down from the project site. His building was recently purchased by investors and is being painted and renovated. The rehabilitated units go for $2,400 and up. “People are getting priced out,” he said. “It’s not about ‘We need more housing.’ Yeah, we can use it, but it needs to be affordable.” Image L.C. Stephens lives in an apartment complex that was recently purchased by investors. “People are getting priced out,” he said. Credit... Andrew Burton for The New York Times The proposed homes are not that. They are estimated to sell for around $1 million. But this is an illustration of the economist’s argument that more housing will lower prices. The cost of a rehabilitated single-family home in the area — which is what many of the neighbors preferred to see on the lot — runs to $1.4 million or more. Even so, economics is not politics. The argument that quiet, low-slung neighborhoods have to change to keep everyone from being priced out is never going to be a political winner. When the Haskell Street proposal came up for a vote,  Jesse Arreguin , who was then a city councilman but is now the mayor of Berkeley, gave a “no” vote that sounded like a campaign speech. “This issue is bigger than Haskell Street,” Mr. Arreguin said. “This project sets a precedent for what I believe is out-of-scale development that will compromise the quality of life and character of our neighborhoods throughout the city of Berkeley.” The city’s denial won applause from the crowd. It also drew a lawsuit. Making It Easier to Sue Not-in-my-backyard activism has been a fixture of California for long enough that the state already has a law about it. In 1982, Mr. Brown, during his first run as governor, signed the Housing Accountability Act, colloquially known as the “anti-Nimby law.” The law bars cities from stopping developments that meet local zoning codes. In other words, it’s illegal for cities to ignore their own housing laws. The act is rarely invoked, however, because developers don’t want to sue cities for fear it will anger city councils and make it harder for them to gain approval for other developments. Lately, the law has become a tool for activists. Two years ago,  Sonja Trauss , who leads a group called the Bay Area Renters’ Federation and is running for a seat on San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors, sued Lafayette, a nearby suburb, for violating the Housing Accountability Act, and settled out of court. Shortly after Berkeley denied the Haskell Street permit, Ms. Trauss sued the city — and won. Image Sonja Trauss, leader of the Bay Area Renters’ Federation, successfully sued the city of Berkeley over its denial of a permit for the Haskell Street project. Credit... Andrew Burton for The New York Times Berkeley agreed to give the project a new hearing and consider the Housing Accountability Act when reviewing future development. Neighbors, still incensed, continued to put pressure on the city to deny it. And the city did, this time refusing a demolition permit. Ms. Trauss sued again, and in July a Superior Court judge for Alameda County ordered the city to issue the permit. “Organizing alone doesn’t get us out of the crisis,” said Ryan J. Patterson, Ms. Trauss’s lawyer and a partner at Zacks, Freedman & Patterson in San Francisco. “You have to have a fist people fear.” This almost certainly marks the beginning  of a trend . Right about the time Ms. Trauss sued Berkeley, Mr. Hanlon started raising money for California Yimby. He found traction in the local technology industry, whose growth is partly responsible for the Bay Area’s housing crunch but whose employees are similarly discouraged by the astronomical rents. Nat Friedman, a serial entrepreneur who became a vice president at Microsoft after selling his company to the software giant last year, has helped California Yimby raise close to $1 million for its efforts to lobby the state on housing issues. “The smaller the unit of government, the harder it is to solve this problem,” Mr. Friedman said. Mr. Hanlon’s first project was to push for a law that would make it easier to sue cities under the Housing Accountability Act. The result was S.B. 167, a bill written by  Nancy Skinner , Berkeley’s state senator and a former member of the City Council. In addition to raising the legal burden of proof for cities to deny new housing projects, the bill makes the suits more expensive to defend by requiring cities that lose to pay the other side’s lawyers’ fees. “What’s frustrating for anybody trying to build housing is that they try to play by the rules and they still get told ‘no,’” Ms. Skinner said. Image The approval of a state law making it easier to sue cities that deny housing projects could put development on a faster track. Credit... Andrew Burton for The New York Times Ms. Skinner’s law takes effect next year, so the long-term impact is unclear. But just a few weeks before it was signed, the Zoning Adjustments Board had another contentious housing project. Neighbors had familiar complaints: The homes were too tall, had long shadows, and more residents would make it harder to find parking. The board’s chairman responded that he understood the concerns but couldn’t risk another lawsuit. California isn’t going to solve its housing problem in the courts. But the basic idea — big-footing local government so that cities have a harder time blocking development — is central to the solutions that the state is pursuing. This is a state of great ambition. It wants to lead the country on actions to reduce carbon emissions, and has enacted legislation mandating a $15 minimum wage by 2022. But housing is undermining all of it. Even with a growing economy and its efforts to raise wages, California has the  highest poverty rate  in the nation, with one in five residents living in poverty, once housing costs are taken into account. And plans to reduce carbon emissions  are being undermined  by high home prices that are pushing people  farther and farther  from work. In a brief speech before signing the recent package of housing bills, Mr. Brown talked about how yesterday’s best intentions become today’s problems. California cities have some of the nation’s strictest building regulations, and measures to do things like encourage energy efficiency and enhance neighborhood aesthetics eventually become regulatory overreach. “City and state people did all this good stuff,” Mr. Brown said to a crowd of legislators. “But, as I always say, too many goods create a bad.”",2023-11-25 22:44:02.857212+00:00,True,False,,,,The Great American Single-Family Home Problem - The New York Times,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65998,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/21/apple-admits-slowing-older-iphones-because-of-flagging-batteries,2017-12-20 08:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,,"Published on 2017-12-21 00:00:00. After years of rumours, Apple has confirmed that it does indeed slow down older iPhones, a feature introduced last year to protect against problems caused by ageing batteries.



The feature was implemented on the iPhone 6, 6S and SE last year during a software update, and on the iPhone 7 as of December with the release of iOS 11.2. The feature is planned to be rolled out to newer devices in the future.

Apple said it slowed down phones that have older batteries, batteries with low charge or that are cold.

An Apple spokesperson said: “Our goal is to deliver the best experience for customers, which includes overall performance and prolonging the life of their devices.”

The company explained that when a battery is in a poor condition it may not be able to supply the required maximum current demanded by the phone’s processor at full speed. If that happens, the iPhone can shut down unexpectedly to protect the internal components.

It was one of the factors contributing to users finding that their iPhone 6S would turn off abruptly, even though there was about 30-40% charge remaining in the battery.

“Last year we released a feature for iPhone 6, iPhone 6S and iPhone SE to smooth out the instantaneous peaks only when needed to prevent the device from unexpectedly shutting down during these conditions,” said an Apple spokesperson. “We’ve now extended that feature to iPhone 7 with iOS 11.2, and plan to add support for other products in the future.”

The feature was recently highlighted by users on Reddit, who noticed that their processors were running slowly in iPhones with older batteries, but that when they replaced the batteries the speed of the phone returned to normal.

Analysis of data by benchmarking firm Primate Labs collected from thousands of iPhones appeared to confirm the theory, showing multiple performance peaks for phones of different ages, slowing down from their maximum speed.

The confirmation will reignite the debate over “planned obsolescence”, the practice of intentionally hobbling a device after a certain period to nudge users into buying new products. Experts have long dismissed users’ complaints that their iPhones have slowed down immediately before the release of a new model.

Apple insists that this slowdown feature is not an example of planned obsolescence, and instead is designed to protect against battery problems and prolong the life of iPhones. But the poor communication to users of the fact that Apple considers this a feature, not a bug, has caused many to lash out at the company.

John Poole, the founder of Primate Labs, said in his analysis of the Geekbench data that “users expect either full performance, or reduced performance with a notification that their phone is in low-power mode. This fix creates a third, unexpected state.”

“While this state is created to mask a deficiency in battery power, users may believe that the slowdown is due to CPU performance, instead of battery performance, which is triggering an Apple-introduced CPU slowdown.”

The problem can be fixed by replacing the phone’s battery. Apple charges £79 ($79) to replace batteries not covered under the phone’s warranty.

66686,https://www.wired.com/story/apple-iphone-battery-slow-down/,2017-12-21 08:00:00+00:00,https://www.wired.com,,"Published on 2017-12-21 19:50:00+00:00.  On Wednesday, Apple  confirmed what many customers have long suspected: The company has been slowing the performance of older iPhones.  Apple  says it started the practice a year ago, to compensate for battery degradation, rather than push people to upgrade their smartphones faster. But even giving that benefit of the doubt, there are plenty of better ways Apple could have accomplished the same goal without betraying customer trust. Earlier this week, John Poole, a developer at Geekbench, published a  blog post  indicating that a change in iOS is slowing down performance on older devices. According to Apple, factors like low charge, cold climates, and natural battery degradation can all affect the performance of its mobile devices, and the company confirmed that this policy was implemented last year to counteract these effects. As much sense as that explanation may make, Apple could have made plenty of choices that would have benefited consumers instead of penalizing them. These same choices could have also saved the company from the public shaming it suffered this week. Fresh Juice In a statement to WIRED, Apple confirmed Poole's findings, saying it was purposely slowing down older iPhones to compensate for the effects of age on their batteries. ""Lithium-ion batteries become less capable of supplying peak current demands when in cold conditions, have a low battery charge or as they age over time, which can result in the device unexpectedly shutting down to protect its electronic components,"" the company says. While many have speculated that the company has been doing this for years, Apple says the feature was implemented last year for the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, and iPhone SE. Now, with iOS 11.2, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are getting the same treatment, and the company intends to bring other devices into the fold down the road. Rather than secretly hamstring the iPhone's CPU, though, Apple could have simply educated users about the limitations of lithium-ion batteries, says Kyle Wiens, CEO of iFixit, a company that sells repair kits and posts repair guides for consumer electronics. While Apple does say in the  iPhone user manual  that batteries degrade over time and should be replaced, you'd have to dig through a few links outside of the manual to learn that by 500 charge cycles, your phone's battery will hold a charge of about  80 percent . Another tactic Apple could employ is selling battery replacement kits to consumers, letting them pop a fresh battery into their aging iPhone. It would be an easily understandable solution to an easily understandable problem, rather than software manipulation that feeds into a long-running, planned obsolescence conspiracy theory. But Apple has actively fought against laws that would require it to provide a way for users to repair their devices. According to a report from  HuffPost , Apple argues that allowing consumers to replace the battery could make the iPhone more vulnerable to hacks, and that letting people peek inside would make the iPhone easier to counterfeit. ""Apple won't sell batteries to consumers, people should be furious about that,"" Wiens says. ""Your battery is a maintenance item, and everyone should expect to replace their battery fairly frequently."" Apple does cover one battery replacement under its one-year warranty program, but only for ""defective batteries,"" a term that isn't clearly defined on the company's site. If your phone is out of warranty and you don't have an AppleCare+ plan, the company offers a battery replacement for $79 plus a $6.95 shipping charge. The problem, Wiens says, is that Apple doesn't advertise this policy to consumers, leaving iPhone users to believe that the only solution is to buy a costly iPhone. Choices Choices Direct battery fixes certainly would have made the most sense. But even allowing that a software tweak was the only way Apple could have proceeded—untrue, but just for argument's sake—it had a much better option than making its software solution covert. Rather than quietly push out an update that crimped older iPhones, it should have made that throttling opt-in. As it stands, there's no way to avoid having your phone slowed down once the battery reaches its limits. By giving users the choice, and giving them the information necessary to make their own decision, Apple could avoid the frustrations many have expressed over the policy. While making the throttling opt-in could cause performance issues for users who opt-out, it would give users a sense of control over the situation and avoid making them feel like they're being tricked into buying a new phone. As it stands, Apple's move comes off as deceptive. Instead of leaving users confused about why their phones are suddenly slowing to a crawl, Apple could take user education a step further by providing a battery health monitor in the Settings app. That way, an iPhone owner could figure out if the battery is the issue, or if  something else is going on . Lay Down the Law The damage, unfortunately, is already done. But it's also unlikely that Apple will behave differently going forward. At the very least, the company almost certainly won't shift gears and start selling battery replacement kits to consumers. For starters, the iPhone's casing uses proprietary Pentalobe screws, which make it hard for average users to get inside to swap the battery. Apple has also lobbied against  right-to-repair legislation , which would allow third-party repair shops and typical consumers to more easily fix their broken phones. Proposed right-to-repair laws typically require companies to publish their repair manuals, as well as make the necessary repair tools available for purchase rather than requiring a specialist to make these repairs. Wiens says that, ideally, right-to-repair legislation would pass and ensure consumers have the ability to fix their devices on their own terms without having to deal with warranties or acquire difficult-to-find tools. Apple's throttling is misleading, and it's far from the best way the company could have handled the situation. Still, lithium-ion batteries are riddled with problems users should be aware of.

Apple on Wednesday said a software feature released last year makes your phone operate more slowly to offset problems with its aging lithium ion battery. As batteries get older, they don't hold their charges as well as newer batteries, and can have worse problems when the charge is low or the temperature is cold.

The aging battery means your phone could have trouble operating or might unexpectedly shut down, as happened to the iPhone 6 and 6S last year. The processors in those devices wanted to hit faster speeds, but their batteries couldn't handle the demand, prompting some phones to simply switch themselves off.

To address that, Apple's iOS software, starting with last year's iOS 10.2.1, incorporated better power management capabilities, the company says. The operating system slows down your device to prevent it from shutting down, Apple says, but only in cases of cold temperature, a low battery charge or very old batteries.

Instead of your processor completing a task immediately, it will spread that out over more attempts to help manage the power consumption.

Watch this: Yep, Apple slows down older iPhones 01:24

You may be wondering why we can't simply get better batteries. So do consumer electronics companies, which have thrown millions of dollars at the problem, with very little to show for it. An advanced battery startup in California, Envia Systems, a few years ago did some research and found that it took more than a decade, from 1995 to 2007, to double the energy stored in a battery -- and since then it hasn't even risen by 30 percent.

Meanwhile, smartphone users continue to look for ways to set things right when their batteries start wheezing and sputtering. Over on Reddit, for instance, the discussion has turned to whether it makes sense to replace an iPhone battery, how to do so and what the consequences might be.

Apple's software from last year applied to the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, 6S and 6S Plus and SE. This year's iOS 11.2 extended the feature to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. It will be applied to other Apple devices in the future.

Apple said in a statement:

""Our goal is to deliver the best experience for customers, which includes overall performance and prolonging the life of their devices. Lithium-ion batteries become less capable of supplying peak current demands when in cold conditions, have a low battery charge or as they age over time, which can result in the device unexpectedly shutting down to protect its electronic components. Last year we released a feature for iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone SE to smooth out the instantaneous peaks only when needed to prevent the device from unexpectedly shutting down during these conditions. We've now extended that feature to iPhone 7 with iOS 11.2, and plan to add support for other products in the future.""

The statement from Apple came in response to a report earlier this week from Primate Labs, the company behind the Geekbench processor benchmarking software. John Poole, founder of the organization, said in a blog post that processors in iPhones slow down and decrease in performance as batteries age and lose capacity. Poole explained that users expect their phones to perform the same regardless of how old the battery is, but his tests indicated that wasn't the case.

iPhone users have long complained their devices seem to slow down when new models are released. Some have said they believe it to be a purposeful effort by Apple (and other tech companies) to hamper the performance in order to get users to buy new models. Apple has long denied this assertion.

iPhone battery angst

Still, its lack of transparency about making iPhones run slower caused backlash online.

""Apple should have been more transparent with end users, the press and analysts,"" Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Pat Moorhead said.

And Marco Arment, an iOS developer who co-founded Tumblr, tweeted that ""the reputation damage from secretly slowing down old iPhones, regardless of the reason, will likely linger for a decade.""

Many people called for Apple to notify users when it started throttling their phones' performance, as well as give them a setting to decide whether to allow that slowdown or not.

Ban Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies, said Apple should give users the option.

""The battery life issue for Apple, and iPhones, is a fascinating one because the average life of an iPhone is so much longer than other devices,"" he tweeted. ""It is their attempt to problem solve for lots of people who hold onto phones for [three] years or longer.""

Apple's iPhone 6, from 2014, includes software that slows it down but also prevents unexpected shutdowns. CNET

Apple didn't comment on whether a new iOS release would add notifications or an option to turn off the slowing feature.

For some people, the solution to a slower, older iPhone may be to update the battery instead of purchasing a brand-new device. Apple charges $79 to replace the battery of an iPhone that's no longer covered by a warranty. You also can buy a kit online to replace the battery yourself, something that's not exactly easy.

Apple has faced criticism about how difficult it is to replace iPhone batteries. Many older Android phones had removable backs that allowed users to swap out their batteries (though using new materials like metals has caused some, like Samsung, to stop offering that sort of phone design). For an iPhone, though, changing a battery has long been a tough task. An iFixit guide on replacing the iPhone 6 battery involves 25 steps. The screws to take the device apart are tiny, and making a mistake can cause you to brick the phone.

If you opt to replace your iPhone battery, the feature that slows down the phone will automatically turn off. You'll no longer see your iPhone performance slow -- at least not until that battery gets old, too.

By Leo Kelion Technology desk editor

WATCH: LG's marketing chief said Cloi ""doesn't like me"" after it ignored his commands

A robot created by LG to help users control their smart home repeatedly failed on stage at its CES debut.

Cloi was meant to be the centrepiece of the South Korean firm's presentation where it was supposed to show how new artificial intelligence tech could enhance use of kitchen appliances.

Instead it gave no response to three consecutive commands beyond blinking.

Experts say the demo represented a ""disastrous"" debut for the bot, which was mocked on social media.

The event was the first press conference of the morning at the Las Vegas tech fair. Samsung, Intel, HTC and Sony are among other big companies scheduled to unveil products over the course of the day.

'Ultimate in simplicity'

LG's focus this year was to promote ThinQ, its in-house AI software, which it intends to roll out across various products to make them easier to use and capable of ""evolving"" to meet customers' needs.

Although LG also includes Google's Assistant in some of its latest TVs and smart speakers, it has chosen to rely on its own solution for its robots.

The firm already has robots in use in South Korean shopping centres and airports, and also makes robotic vacuums for the home.

But Cloi - which is pronounced Kloh-ee - represents a push to put the technology at the heart of consumers' homes.

LG

LG said that Cloi had been deliberately designed to appear cute

The machine was described as being the ""ultimate in simplicity when managing your smart home,"" when it was presented on stage by David VanderWaal, LG's US marketing chief.

And it initially behaved as planned when he asked it for his schedule.

But subsequent requests to find out if his washing was ready, what was planned for dinner and what recipes it could suggest for chicken all fell flat.

""The first time it failed everyone laughed and thought it was just a glitch,"" commented Ben Wood, an analyst at CCS Insight, who was in the audience.

""The second time, there was a realisation that something was wrong.

""And when it failed again, there was a stunned silence in the audience and then a bit of hubbub as people felt sorry for this guy.""

Although it is far from the first time a CES demo has gone awry, Mr Wood said it highlighted a problem with many of the AI-based technologies being pitched to the public.

""It will be damaging to LG and highlights a broader point about all the companies exhibiting here: is their technology really ready for prime time?""

Carry, serve and shop

Mr VanderWaal later unveiled a further three robots, highlighting LG's ambitions in the sector.

LG describes its three new commercial robots as being ""concepts"" at this stage

Porter Robot, which is designed to carry hotel guests luggage to their room and provide check-in and check-out services without the need to queue at a front desk

Shopping Cart Robot, which features a bar code scanner so that supermarket visitors can log each item they put inside before paying via the machine as well

Serving Robot, which is designed to deliver meals and drinks in restaurants and airport lounges

However, by this point many viewers of the firm's YouTube livestream were more preoccupied by making jokes about Cloi's earlier appearance.

One suggested that she was a feminist who did not enjoy being bossed about in the kitchen, while another posted: ""RIP Cloi﻿ 2018-2018"".

Twitter users also joined in the fun.

One industry-watcher said LG was likely to take a short-term hit to its brand as a result of the event, but said that it would also serve as a reminder that the promise of a ""seamless"" smart home was still some way off.

""The target market for these kinds of products is still hi-tech-friendly early adopters who are willing to put in more effort than the regular user,"" said Tuong Nguyen from the consultancy Gartner.

""But even for early adopters, it tends to be a little more work than expected.

Apple has finally released a software update to fix a pesky bug that rendered some iPhone 8 devices practically useless.

The tech giant released iOS 11.3.1 on Tuesday, which resolves a previous issue where people had their iPhone 8 screens repaired by a third party, only to find out that the touchscreen stopped working.

Earlier this month, users began complaining that their $700 (£700) iPhone 8s were unresponsive after they went to third-party repair shops.

iOS 11.3.1 is a minor software update, but Apple says it should resolve the iPhone 8 screen issue.

According to the release: 'iOS 11.3.1 improves the security of your iPhone or iPad and addresses an issue where touch input was unresponsive on some iPhone 8 devices because they were serviced with non-genuine replacement displays'.

Many believed that the bug was the latest example of Apple's battle against people going to independent repair shops to get their devices fixed.

Consumers argued that Apple was deliberately causing the refurbished iPhone 8 screens to malfunction in order to persuade them to use the firm's licensed repair services that are more expensive.

The software update warns users against going to unlicensed vendors.

'Non-genuine replacement displays may have compromised visual quality and may fail to work correctly,' the release stated.

Consumers say that Apple was deliberately causing the refurbished iPhone 8 screens to fail in order to persuade them to use the firm's licensed repair services that are more expensive

'Apple-certified screen repairs are performed by trusted experts who use genuine Apple parts'.

The firm has long taken a defensive stance against third-party repairs.

It was only until last year that Apple announced that third-party iPhone repairs would no longer prevent a device from being covered under warranty.

However, the policy change only applied if it was unrelated to a screen repair.

It's also not the first time that iPhones with repaired screens experienced malfunctioning screens.

Last year, a similar iOS update killed touch functionality on the iPhone 7 devices repaired by a third-party.

However, a week later the company resolved the issue.

HOW DO YOU UPDATE YOUR APPLE DEVICES? To make sure you are have all the new updates, download the latest software update on your device. On iOS, go to Settings, General then Software Update, then tap Download and Install.

On MacOS, open the App Store and click Updates in the App Store toolbar, then use the Update buttons to download and install any updates listed.

On Apple TV, go to Settings, System, then Software Updates. Select Update Software, then select Download and Install. After the update downloads, your Apple TV will restart and prepare the update. Advertisement

Additionally, the firm's recent software update, iOS 11.3, fixed the controversial battery throttling issue.

Users can now see if the power management feature that dynamically manages maximum performance to prevent unexpected shutdowns, first introduced in iOS 10.2.1, is on and can choose to turn it off.

This feature can be found in Settings -> Battery and is available for iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.

The update tool is the result of a barrage of criticism that Apple faced when it was revealed that iOS automatically slows down processor performance in some iPhones to prevent unexpected shutdowns.

The tech giant now faces some 60 lawsuits from users that claim Apple slowed down older iPhones to make them buy new ones.

A website linked to more than 4m cyber-attacks worldwide, including against some of Britain’s biggest banks, has been shut down following a UK- and Netherlands-led operation.

Webstresser.org had 136,000 registered users and could be rented for about £10 to launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, in which high volumes of internet traffic are launched at target computers to disable them.

Following an investigation led by the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) and the Dutch national police, servers were seized at 11.30am on Wednesday in the Netherlands, the US and Germany, effecting a takedown of the website.

Suspected members of the group were arrested on Tuesday in Scotland, Canada and Serbia, the NCA said. Croatian police said they had arrested a 19-year old man who faces charges of criminal acts against computer systems. The operation was supported by Europol and Police Scotland, as well as law enforcement in 11 countries.

NCA officers also raided a property in Bradford, where the agency believed a suspect linked to the address used the Webstresser service to target seven of the UK’s biggest banks in attacks in November last year. The banks, which have not been named by investigators, were forced to reduce their operations or shut down entire systems, incurring costs in the hundreds of thousands.

Jo Goodall, senior investigating officer at the NCA, said: “A significant criminal website has been shut down and the sophisticated crime group behind it stopped as a result of an international investigation involving law enforcement agencies from 11 countries.“The arrests made over the past two days show that the internet does not provide bulletproof anonymity to offenders and we expect to identify further suspects linked to the site in the coming weeks and months as we examine the evidence we have gathered.”

Individuals with little or no technical knowledge could use the Webstresser service to launch crippling cyber-attacks across the world.

Other targets have included government institutions and police forces, as well as victims in the gaming industry.

Gert Ras, the head of the national hi-tech crime unit at the Dutch police, said: “By taking down the world’s largest illegal DDoS seller in a worldwide joint law-enforcement operation based on NCA intelligence, we have made an unprecedented impact on DDoS cybercrime. Not only were the administrators of this illegal service arrested, but also users will now face prosecution and civil liability for caused damage.

“This is a warning to all wannabe DDoS-ers: do not DDoS because, through close law-enforcement collaboration, we will identify you, bring you to court and facilitate that you will be held liable by the victims for the huge damage you cause.”

Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) and the Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-Cat) supported the investigation by assisting the exchange of information between all partners. A command-and-coordination post was set up at Europol’s headquarters in The Hague, in the Netherlands, on the action day.",2023-11-26 16:01:29.952494+00:00,True,True,False,,,Website linked to cyber-attacks against UK banks is shut down - The Guardian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apple’s latest iOS 11.3 software update is causing iPhone 8 devices with third-party repaired screens to stop working.



Users who have had a screen repair performed by a third party, rather than with Apple, on their iPhone 8 smartphones found that the iOS 11.3 update stopped the touchscreen from working, reports Motherboard. The update was pushed out on 29 March, introducing Apple’s promised iPhone battery health information, as well as the ability to turn off the slowing down of smartphones related to the battery following the scandal in December.

The screens continue to display the homescreen once updated to iOS 11.3 but cannot be interacted with, effectively rendering the affected iPhone 8 device unusable without warning from Apple.

“This has caused my company over 2,000 reshipments,” Aakshay Kripalani, chief executive of repair shop Injured Gadgets told Motherboard. “Customers are annoyed and it seems like Apple is doing this to prevent customers from doing third-party repair.”

There is little affected users can do for their £700-plus smartphones other than have the screen replaced again, hopefully with one that will work regardless of the iOS 11.3 update. But this is not the first time a software update from Apple has caused serious problems for those opting to repair their broken smartphones at third-party shops rather than sending them to the manufacturer.

A similar thing happened for the iPhone 7 last year. An iOS update prevented the touchscreens from working on iPhone 7s with third-party repaired screens. Apple then released a follow-up software update that made them work again, resolving the issue.

That followed the storm caused by the so called Error 53, which rendered iPhones useless if they had had their home button replaced by third-party repair shops after a software update. The problem was related to the Touch ID fingerprint scanner embedded within the home button. Apple later apologised and issued a fix for the Error 53 issue.

The consequence is that at any stage Apple may break iPhones that have been repaired by third parties via software updates, effectively making its in-store service the only viable option. Apple charges £156.44 to repair the screen of an iPhone 6S, 7 or 8, £176.44 for the larger iPhone 6S Plus, 7 Plus or 8 Plus or £286.44 for the top-of-the-line iPhone X.

Repairing “other damage” costs between £306.44 and £556.44 for an iPhone 6 or newer. Apple also offers an optional insurance policy, called AppleCare+, which costs £129 for two years for an iPhone 8 and then charges users £25 each screen or £79 for other damage – but users can only claim for two incidents.

Third-party repair shops, which are popular in the era of glass phones and frequently smashed screens, often undercut Apple and offer services Apple does not. Unless they are an authorised-by-Apple repair provider, however, they can only obtain “after-market” parts, not parts directly from the iPhone manufacturer.

Keen Lab

The hack attack tests were all carried out in controlled environments

BMW's car computer systems have been found to contain 14 separate flaws, according to a study by a Chinese cyber-security lab.

They could, in theory, let hackers take at least partial control of affected vehicles while in use.

The researchers identified ways to compromise the cars by plugging in infected USB sticks, as well via contactless means including Bluetooth and the vehicles' own 3G/4G data links.

BMW is working on fixes.

Its customers have been advised to keep an eye out for software updates and other counter-measures from the German company over the coming months.

Remote attack

Keen Lab - a division of the Chinese technology giant Tencent - began its investigation in January 2017 and shared its findings with BMW just over a year later.

It said the vulnerabilities were found mostly within three different parts of the cars' electronics:

the internet-connected infotainment systems - which provide sat-nav guidance, radio-station playback, car diagnostic information, and in some cases voice-recognition services

the telematics control unit - the electronics and software that allow a vehicle's location to be tracked

the central gateway module - the information bridge that controls the flow of data between the vehicle's various electrical components

The researchers are holding back their full findings until 2019, to give BMW more time to tackle the problems.

Keen Lab

Keen Lab says that it was able to simulate remote attacks on BMW cars

But they described one scenario in which a rogue mobile data transmitter could be used to exploit vulnerabilities in the infotainment and telematics parts.

""Technically speaking, it's possible to launch the attack from hundreds of metres, even when the car is in the driving mode,"" they wrote, adding that attackers could then create ""backdoors"" to inject diagnostic messages that could in turn affect the driver's control.

Several models of BMW cars are said to be affected, including at least some of its i, X, 3, 5 and 7 Series designs.

BMW has verified all the reported vulnerabilities, and awarded Keen Lab with an ""IT research"" prize earlier this week for its work.

""We have been working closely with Tencent for months to understand and address any cyber-security issues,"" said a spokesman for the car manufacturer.

""It has been a collaborative relationship and an important one as this kind of security has now become such an important topic for manufacturers.""

Keen Lab

Keen Lab says it tested four different types of BMW car during its tests

The time has come for Apple to pay for the infamous Error 53 that bricked iPhones and iPads taken to a third party for repairs.

The Federal Court of Australia announced Monday its order for Apple to pay AU$9 million (around US $6.6 million converted) for telling customers who encountered the error they weren't entitled to a refund.

The error was first reported in 2016. If you fixed a cracked screen or a failing Touch ID-enabled home button through a third party not licensed by Apple, ""security checks"" would render your iPhone or iPad unusable, showing only the message ""Error 53"".

Apple explained the message as a security measure to protect the iPhone's fingerprint sensor from exploitation. It released an iOS 9.2.1 update later that February to restore bricked devices, but reports showed it did not re-enable Touch ID and customers complained they still lost photos, documents and apps.

Watch this: Outcry over iPhone 'Error 53' and bad USB Type-C cables 02:24

In April 2017, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) commenced a legal battle with Apple in the Federal Court of Australia. It said Apple violated customers' rights under Australian Consumer Law to repairs for devices bricked by Error 53.

Then, in June 2017, the ACCC conducted an undercover operation involving 13 calls with Apple retailers in Australia, in which Apple representatives allegedly said Apple did not have responsibility to remedy faulty iPhones repaired by an unauthorised third party.

Apple has since admitted that from February 2015 to February 2016 it misdirected 275 Australian customers looking for compensation for devices bricked by Error 53, through its US website and Apple staff in Australian stores and on customer service phone calls.

According to Australian Consumer Law, that's not on.

""The Court declared the mere fact that an iPhone or iPad had been repaired by someone other than Apple did not, and could not, result in the consumer guarantees ceasing to apply, or the consumer's right to a remedy being extinguished,"" ACCC Commissioner Sarah Court said.

The ACCC had notified Apple about its investigation, spurring Apple to compensate 5,000 affected customers. That allegedly involved Apple exchanging faulty iPhones and iPads for refurbished replacements, not completely new devices. Apple has since committed to new replacements -- if you request one.

""If people buy an iPhone or iPad from Apple and it suffers a major failure, they are entitled to a refund. If customers would prefer a replacement, they are entitled to a new device as opposed to refurbished, if one is available,"" Court said.

Expect your Apple store workers to wear even bigger smiles: Apple says it will improve staff training, systems and procedures to ensure future compliance with Australian Consumer Law.

""We're constantly looking for ways to enhance the service we deliver and we had very productive conversations with the ACCC about this,"" an Apple spokesman said. ""We will continue to do all we can to deliver excellent service to all of our customers in Australia.""

Medical experts working with IBMon its Watson for Oncology system discovered that it made 'often inaccurate' and 'unsafe' treatment recommendations, internal documents showed

The documents were included in two presentations given in June and July 2017 by IBM Watson's former deputy health chief Andrew Norden.

In one case, a 65-year-old patient was diagnosed with lung cancer and said he had developed severe bleeding.

Watson recommended he be given chemotherapy and receive a drug called 'Bevacizumab,' but Stat News noted that the drug can result in 'severe or fatal hemorrhage' and shouldn't be administered to people with severe bleeding.

A spokesperson for Memorial Sloan Kettering told Stat News that the suggestion was hypothetical; instead, it was a part of system testing.

However, several people related to the project said Watson's inaccuracies raise 'serious questions about the process for building content and the underlying technology.'

'This product is a piece of s***,' a doctor at Jupiter Hospital in Florida told executives at IBM, according to Stat News.

In one case, Watson recommended that a patient with lung cancer and internal bleeding be administered a drug that can result in 'severe or fatal hemorrhage'

HOW DOES IBM'S WATSON HELP DIAGNOSE CANCER? The Watson artificial intelligence system, developed by US firm IBM, examines medical images and patient records. These are then compared to thousands of past cases and medicals journals to come to a conclusion. Doctors at 55 hospitals around the world have been using the system to help them diagnose patients for breast, lung, colorectal, cervical, ovarian, gastric and prostate cancers. IBM claims the technology will be extended to detect a further five cancer types by the end of the year and will be rolled out to other hospitals worldwide. Advertisement

'We bought it for marketing and with hopes that you would achieve the vision. We can't use it for most cases.'

Not only did people have concerns about Watson's suggestions, but people also questioned the way that Watson was trained for this particular project.

The AI system was supposed to analyze data from real patients, but instead it was fed hypothetical data.

It meant that doctors were receiving recommendations from other doctors, not those reached by an AI synthesizing vast amounts of data and reaching its own conclusions.

Doctors at Jupiter Hospital told Gizmodo that instead of relying on Watson, they use the supercomputer as an extra opinion if they cannot agree on treatment.

So while it's not a glowing endorsement, it appears medical professionals are still using Watson in some capacity.

Additionally, a spokesperson for IBM told Gizmodo that Watson is still learning and is currently being used by 230 hospitals around the world, supporting care for over 84,000 patients.

The company also disagreed in part with the internal documents, saying they don't give a timely representation of Watson.

'We have learned and improved Watson Health on continuous feedback from clients, new scientific evidence, and new cancers and treatment alternatives,' the spokesperson told Gizmodo.

Entrepreneur Sir Peter Wood is to make £360m from selling his stake in the insurer esure, which is being bought by a private equity company.

The insurer, which also owns Shelia's Wheels, is being bought for £1.2bn by Bain Capital.

Sir Peter, who founded esure, will reinvest £50m into the business and will remain as chairman.

The deal was announced alongside interim results showing a £14m hit from the cold weather earlier in the year.

More customers made claims for burst pipes and problems with their cars caused by the ""Beast from the East"".

Profits in the first six months of the year fell 20% to £36.1m.

But Sir Peter said the business was delivering ""profitable growth"" and described the takeover by Bain as ""a great outcome for shareholders"".

It means that the shares, which were floated at 290p in March 2013, will no longer be listed on the stock market, assuming the deal is completed.

Bain is offering 280p a share, although this cannot be compared directly with the original price as the company has bought and sold GoCompare since then.

The offer price is a 37% premium to the price before news of the deal emerged.

The shares were trading 3.5% higher on Tuesday at 277p,

Sir Peter is known for revolutionising the insurance market when, in the 1980s, he started Direct Line, backed by Royal Bank of Scotland, allowing customers to buy insurance directly over the phone.

At the time, a payout of £18m to him was described as ""obscene"".

His stake was later bought out by RBS and he went on to create esure with the banking of HBOS, before it was taken over by Lloyds during the financial crisis. Sir Peter led £185m a management buyout from Lloyds in 2010.

When esure was floated in 2013, he made nearly £200m.

He spends his holidays in Palm Beach. According to reports, he owns one of the world's largest collections of Margaret Thatcher's clothes.

Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: ""A formal offer from Bain Capital at a sizeable premium to market price means esure will, in all likelihood, be leaving the stock market soon.

Sept 5 (Reuters) - Offshore driller Transocean Ltd expects rates to lease drilling rigs to improve and contracting activity to pick up in late 2019, an outlook that drove its recent decision to purchase rival Ocean Rig UDW Inc for $2.7 billion, Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Thigpen said on Wednesday.

Transocean on Tuesday agreed to buy Ocean Rig, marking its second major acquisition this year. Earlier this year, it also closed on a $1.1 billion acquisition of Norwegian rig firm Songa Offshore.

The acquisitions signal an improved outlook for the offshore drilling sector which has been slow to recover from the 2014 oil price crash. Offshore fields typically require higher oil prices because they are more costly to develop.

""We are far more bullish than we have been historically,"" Thigpen said at a Barclay's conference in New York. The improved outlook for day rates and contracting activity underpinned the decision to acquire Ocean Rig, he said.

Transocean's stock fell more than 6 percent this week after it announced plans to buy Ocean Rig.

The company expects the market for offshore drilling vessels to move back into balance in the coming years, as some 60 units are going to come off contracts and retire, Thigpen said.

He estimated actual marketable supply of offshore drilling vessels is around 184, and will increase to about 218 in the coming years.

Apple and Samsung are being fined €10m and €5m respectively in Italy for the “planned obsolescence” of their smartphones.

An investigation launched in January by the nation’s competition authority found that certain smartphone software updates had a negative effect on the performance of the devices.

Believed to be the first ruling of its kind against smartphone manufacturers, the investigation followed accusations operating system updates for older phones slowed them down, thereby encouraging the purchase of new phones.

In a statement the antitrust watchdog said “Apple and Samsung implemented dishonest commercial practices” and that operating system updates “caused serious malfunctions and significantly reduced performance, thus accelerating phones’ substitution”.

It added the two firms had not provided clients adequate information about the impact of the new software “or any means of restoring the original functionality of the products”.

Samsung told owners of its Galaxy Note 4 phone to install a new version of Google’s Android operating system intended for the more recent Galaxy Note 7, but which users claimed rendered the old model sluggish.

Likewise, Apple told iPhone 6 owners to install an operating system designed for the iPhone 7, leading to problems for owners of the older model.

Both firms were issued the maximum fine of €5m each and ordered to display a notice on their Italian websites informing customers of the watchdog’s decision.

Apple was fined an additional €5m for failing to give customers clear information about “essential” characteristics of lithium batteries, including their average life expectancy, how to maintain them or eventually replace them in the firm’s iPhones.

Apple acknowledged in December that it had intentionally slowed iPhones with degraded batteries through software updates to avoid sudden shutdown problems, but denied it had ever done anything to intentionally shorten the life of a product.

The company later apologised for its actions and reduced the cost of battery replacements. It also added battery health information to iOS and allowed users to turn off the slowing down of the iPhone’s processor.

The Italian antitrust authority opened its investigation following customer complaints around the same time as a similar probe in France, which has yet to conclude.

It is a crime under French law to intentionally shorten the life of any product in order to promote sales. The French consumer protection agency has the power to fine up to 5% of annual turnover or impose a jail term.

Apple also faced questions from the US senate in January over the slowing of iPhones, and a barrage of class-action lawsuits from around the country. More than 60 separate US lawsuits were ordered to be consolidated into a single suit in the Northern District of California, which is still ongoing.

Samsung’s software updates for its phones have not previously been questioned.

A Samsung spokesperson said the company was disappointed by the decision and intends to appeal the fine: “Samsung did not issue any software update that reduced the Galaxy Note 4’s performance. In contrast, Samsung has always released software updates enabling our customers to have the best experience possible.”

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",2023-11-27 16:38:45.192519+00:00,True,True,True,,0.8981571540669784,Apple and Samsung fined for deliberately slowing down phones - The Guardian,,"The software failure incident occurred when Apple and Samsung released certain smartphone software updates that negatively affected the performance of their devices.

On Sunday, September 16, engineers at Facebook detected some unusual activity on the social media platform’s networks. It was an attack, the biggest security breach in Facebook’s history. And it would take the company 11 more days to stop it.

Now, almost a week since the public was first told of the attack, we still barely know anything about what happened.

We don’t know who the hackers were, or what they were looking for. We don’t know whether they were targeting particular people in certain countries. We don’t know how long they had access to users’ information. And we don’t know what, if anything, they took.

What we do know is that for at least 50 million users, the hackers could have seen everything. They could have logged in as if they were those users, and then accessed years of those users’ activity history on the platform — including their private messages.

Things could get very ugly. The hackers could be trolls who decide to post a database of millions of people’s private messages online for everyone to read. They could be Russian intelligence, gathering information from politicians’ personal accounts and then sitting on it until just the right moment to wreak havoc on the midterm or 2020 elections. They could be blackmailers, combing through the messages of high-value targets like politicians, government officials, and wealthy individuals.

Or maybe none of that is true. We might learn that the attackers didn’t access all the information that was exposed, or that they weren’t as sophisticated as feared, that they were just playing around, or that they never quite realized how potentially earth-shaking their accomplishment was. They might never do anything with the information they stole — or they may never have stolen anything at all.

The attackers figured out how to exploit three separate vulnerabilities in Facebook’s code. Facebook said last week it didn’t know when the hackers had figured it all out, but that the vulnerabilities had existed since July 2017.

What the attackers did before Facebook (FB) found and fixed the vulnerabilities may determine the social media company’s future.

Soon, Facebook will have to give the public, lawmakers and regulators, not just in the US but all over the world, answers to some very big questions.

Was September 16, the day the engineers noticed something was amiss, the beginning of the attack? Were the hackers siphoning off data for the 11 days took Facebook to fix the problem? Or, even worse, were the attackers in the system long before Facebook ever detected something was wrong?

The worst scenario for Facebook and its users is that the attackers had unfettered access to 50 million accounts for an extended period of time and knew exactly what they were doing.

If the hackers want to undermine Facebook or cause it lasting damage — or simply create chaos — they could at any time post the private information of millions of people openly online.

Hackers did something like that in 2015 to Ashley Madison, a dating site for people cheating on their partners, posting a searchable database of email addresses registered to accounts on the website. The public disclosure of that kind of private information can have tragic and permanent consequences; some people caught up in the Ashley Madison hack committed suicide.

When the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke earlier this year, it prompted a global outcry and Facebook’s stock tumbled 18%. That story did have the allure of a pink-haired whistleblower and Cambridge’s ties to the Trump campaign. But this breach, which has gotten far less attention, could impact many more people than Cambridge did.

Facebook relies on trust. People trust that their pictures will be seen only by those in their networks, that their private messages will be read only by the people to whom they were sent. Facebook may look like a juggernaut now, but social networks have fallen before, and if this attack destroys that trust, the company could quickly find itself in dire straits.

Figuring out who the attackers were and what they did and didn’t do is now paramount for the company.

One of the most important objectives after discovering an attack is “stopping the bleeding,” Shawn Henry, an FBI veteran who is the president of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Services, told CNN Business. CrowdStrike was hired by the Democratic National Committee after it was hacked during the run-up to the 2016 election.

“You want to establish how deeply infiltrated the environment is, what has the adversary compromised, are they still there? How long have they been there?” he said, speaking not about the Facebook breach specifically, but about his experience running investigations into cyber intrusions.

We may never know who attacked Facebook. We may never know whether they stole personal information. Or we may learn the answers to both — in public and, for tens of millions of people, far too late.",2023-11-27 16:50:58.721234+00:00,True,True,False,,,Facebook just had its worst hack ever — and it could get worse - CNN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It works by encouraging operating system updates for older phones which slow them down, thereby encouraging the purchase of new phones.

Two 'complex investigations' by the anti-trust authority AGCM revealed thatboth firms implemented unfair commercial practices, a statement said.

Apple and Samsung have been fined ten and five million euros (£10m and £4.4m / $11.5m and $5.7m) respectively for the 'planned obsolescence' of their smartphones. The Italian ruling is believed to be the first against the manufacturers following worldwide accusations (stock)

'The two companies have induced consumers to install software updates that are not adequately supported by their devices, without adequately informing them, nor providing them an effective way to recover the full functionality of their devices,' the AGCM said.

Operating system updates 'caused serious malfunctions and significantly reduced their performance, in this way speeding up their replacement with more recent products.'

Samsung 'insistently suggested' to owners of its 2014 Note 4 phone to install a new version of Google's Android operating system intended for the more recent Note 7, the ACGM said.

But that was 'without informing them of the serious malfunctions that the new firmware could cause due to greater stress of device's hardware and asking a high repair cost for out-of-warranty repairs connected to such malfunctions'.

Likewise, Apple 'insistently suggested' to iPhone 6 owners to install an operating system designed for the iPhone 7, 'without warning consumers that its installation could reduce the speed of execution and functionality of devices'.

Apple 'did not offer any specific support measures for iPhones that had experienced such operating problems and were no longer covered by the legal warranty; only in December 2017 Apple provided for the possibility to replace batteries at a discounted price'.

Apple CEO Tim Cook apologised to customers last year after it was revealed the company was quietly slowing some iPhone models without the owners' knowledge (file photo)

DOES APPLE PLAN OLD IPHONES' OBSOLESCENCE? In December 2017, Apple admitted it slows down phones to extend their life and stop them from shutting down as batteries age and become less effective. This is not the first time Apple has been accused of deliberately throttling the performance of its older phones. Explanations for the slowness range from Apple's iOS causing problems on older devices to the firm deliberately slowing down old phones to make people buy the new handsets. This latter explanation is known as planned, or built-in, obsolescence. This is the idea that manufacturer's deliberately make their products in such a way that they become out-of-date sooner. By doing this, the companies can encourage customers to buy the latest model of a certain product. This also stimulates demand for products because people return again and again. Advertisement

Apple was also found not to have told customers about 'essential' characteristics of its phones' lithium batteries, 'such as their average duration and deterioration factors, nor about the correct procedures to maintain, verify and replace batteries in order to preserve full functionality of devices'.

Both companies were fined the maximum possible, Apple paying double Samsung's five-million-euro fine because of its two contested practices.

The Italian anti-trust authority opened its investigation in January following customer complaints around the same time as a similar probe in France.

The US company was forced to admit last year that it intentionally slowed down older models of its iPhones over time, sparking concerns it was unfairly nudging consumers to upgrade.

In an open letter to customers, the firm said: ‘We know that some of you feel Apple has let you down. We apologise.'

At first, Apple had denied it intentionally shortened the life on any of its products.

It said it slowed models to extend the performance of the phone - which uses less power when running at slower speeds - and to prevent unexpected shutdowns.

Apple says its most recent software release, iOS 12, is designed to make everyday tasks on the iPhone and iPad faster.

It also aims to ensure the camera launches up to 70 per cent faster, the keyboard appears up to 50 per cent more quickly, that typing is more responsive and that apps can launch up to twice as fast.

The California-based group also faces a class-action suit in the United States and a slew of lawsuits in Russia.

Samsung in January said that it 'does not provide the software updates to reduce the product performance over the life cycle of the device, according to reports'. It pledged to cooperate with the Italian authorities.

The companies will be required to publish an 'amending declaration' on their Italian websites with a link to the AGCM's ruling.

The Italian anti-trust authority AGCM conducted two investigations and found that both Apple and Samsung implemented unfair commercial practices. Apple specifically suggested to iPhone 6 owners to install an operating system designed for the iPhone 7 without warning them about the potential reduction in speed and functionality.

The row over Apple's decision to slow down the performance of iPhones has resurfaced after the firm revealed its latest iOS update brings the controversial 'throttling' feature to iPhones bought just a year ago.

The firm, which was hit by a huge customer backlash after the 'batterygate' throttling was first revealed, has previously said there was no need to bring the 'performance management feature' to its latest phones.

However, the release notes for iOS 12.1, released on Tuesday, revealed Apple has brought the controversial feature to the iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus - which were released just a year ago.

In iOS 12.1, Apple has brought its controversial throttling feature to the iPhone X (pictured), iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, despite previously saying there was no need for it on its latest phones

IS APPLE THROTTLING YOUR PHONE? To check if Apple is throttling your phone, go to Settings > Battery > Battery Health. It will show the exact amount of degradation on your battery, and it will tell you if it's being throttled. If it is, an option to turn off the feature should be displayed. Advertisement

The row led to many accusing Apple of 'built-in obsolescence' that effectively forced users to buy a new phone.

As batteries in all phones and gadgets age, they become less effective.

Meanwhile, as software becomes more advanced, it puts more of a strain on the battery and processor as the phone ages, and in come cases, this can cause phones to simply shut down.

Apple's performance management feature throttles some system components, such as the CPU and the GPU, as the battery degrades over time to prevent the device from randomly shutting down.

Previously, this was an automatic feature in every iPhone, but following outrage from users, Apple began giving them the option to turn it off in iOS 11.3.

But Apple admitted in the iOS 12.1 release notes that the performance management feature will be turned on for its latest iPhone models - many of which users have only owned for a year or less.

Apple's performance management feature throttles some system components, such as the CPU and the GPU. The firm began giving users the option to turn it off with iOS 11.3

The performance management feature will only kick in after an iPhone has unexpectedly shutdown. At that point, Apple may throttle performance on the device to prevent further battery degradation.

'Additionally, users can see if the performance management feature that dynamically manages maximum performance to prevent unexpected shutdowns is on and can choose to turn it off,' Apple states.

'...This feature applies to iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone SE, iPhone 7, and iPhone 7 Plus.

APPLE REVEALS RECORD PROFITS Apple has revealed record revenue and profits - but admitted it could miss its sales targets for the lucrative holiday season. Revenue for the three months ended Sept. 29 rose nearly 20% to $62.9 billion from the same period a year earlier, while profit soared 32% to $14.13 billion, Apple said. However, Apple was unsure whether it can make enough new iPhones, Apple Watches, iPads and Mac models it released in recent weeks, CEO Tim Cook told Reuters. Advertisement

'Starting with iOS 12.1, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X include this feature, but performance management may be less noticeable due to their more advanced hardware and software design,' the firm added.

However, the firm maintains that the impacts of throttling may be 'less noticeable' on the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X.

That's because these models have more advanced hardware and software that gives a more accurate reading of battery life and which apps are draining the battery the most.

A TIMELINE OF APPLE'S 'BATTERYGATE' December 2017: Apple is forced to apologize after users discover it has been throttling phones as their batteries degrade. The firm begins offering battery replacement discounts. January 2018: Apple is hit with several class-action lawsuits over 'batterygate.' February 2018: Apple claims it won't need throttling in iPhone 8 and X models. March 2018: iOS 11.3 arrives with the option to turn off the performance management feature. October 2018: Apple is slapped with a $5.7 million fine from Italy's antitrust organization over the throttling issue. November 2018: iOS 12.1 arrives with throttling feature for newer models.

Newer models like the iPhone XR, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Plus aren't mentioned in the software update.

It's also unclear how users can turn off the performance management feature.

After updating to iOS 12.1, Gizmodo said it did not see an option in the Battery menu, located in Settings, to disable it.

However, this could simply mean their phone is not yet being throttled.

Users expressed their frustration over the issue not long after it became apparent that the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X would continue to be throttled.

One Twitter user said their iPhone SE battery was 'draining' after they installed iOS 12.1.

'@Apple After the iOS 12.1 update on my iPhone se the battery is draining terribly it’s the third time I am putting my device on charge in a single day,' the user wrote.

Apple's support account responded to many user complaints and suggested they review its webpage on maximizing battery performance.

Over time, the batteries in iPhones inevitably degrade, so even the upgraded components won't prevent that from happening altogether.

As many have noted, the latest update proves that Apple isn't going to stop throttling iPhones anytime soon.

In the coming months or next year, Apple will likely extend the feature to the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR.",2023-11-27 16:56:20.688976+00:00,True,True,True,,0.9092524199998411,Apple will throttle phones because of degrading batteries - but you can turn the feature off - Daily Mail,,"The software failure incident occurred with the release of iOS 12.1 by Apple on November 1, 2018.

When your hotel automatically emails you your booking information, there's a good chance that you're not the only person with access to those documents.

Symantec, a security company, found flaws on hundreds of hotel websites, which were leaking sensitive information like names, phone numbers, passport numbers and addresses in confirmation emails.

Candid Wueest, a threat researcher at Symantec, said he looked at more than 1,500 hotel websites in 54 countries and found the issues among two-thirds of them.

Hotels are a primary target for cyberattacks, as they hold treasure troves of data on guests during vacation season. They are frequently hacked, as cyberattacks on Sheraton, Westin, Starwood, Marriott and Wyndham hotels over the last few years show. Last November, Marriott disclosed that hackers had stolen records from up to 383 million guests in one of the largest personal data breaches in history.

Hotels have a hotbed of data, and their websites have been leaking out that information, Wueest said. One major issue stems from the URL that they send to guests in emails. About 850 hotel websites don't require authentication to see those details, allowing anyone with the link to view your personal information. Nearly one-third of those pages have the booking number in the URL itself, Wueest found.

If the guest were the only person who could view that URL, it wouldn't be much of an issue, but these websites have advertisers and third-party analytics tools embedded on the pages.

Those third parties get that URL too, and a potential attacker could gather that information for malicious purposes, researchers found. Wueest said he found a Google Analytics request for a hotel booking confirmation page contained a URL with the reservation number in plain sight.

All an attacker would have to do with that is enter the reservation number and find out all the sensitive information tied to it.

Several hotel websites were also found to be vulnerable to brute forcing -- when an attacker guesses every possible combination for a reservation number. With computer advances, today a machine can guess every possible combination of an eight-character password in less than three hours. To prevent this, websites will usually limit the number of guesses someone can make.

With one hotel website, Wueest said he was able to brute force his way in and view every active reservation for the company.

He said he reached out to all the hotels with these security issues and one-fourth of them ignored his warnings for more than six weeks. Wueest recommended that hotels stop including booking information in the URL and start implementing authentication measures on confirmation pages.",2023-11-29 02:05:55.313567+00:00,True,True,True,,0.8118601623170818,Your hotel check-in confirmation could be putting you at risk - CNET,Hotel Websites Leaking Sensitive Information in Confirmation Emails,"The software failure incident occurred when Symantec, a security company, discovered flaws on hundreds of hotel websites that were leaking sensitive information in confirmation emails.

Additionally, around one-third of the websites had the booking number directly in the URL. This allowed anyone with the link, including advertisers and third-party analytics tools, to view personal information. The impact of this failure was significant, as it exposed names, phone numbers, passport numbers, and addresses of hotel guests. The responsible entity for the failure was the hotel websites themselves, as they did not implement proper authentication measures or secure the URLs. The impacted entities were the guests who had made bookings through these websites. The failure highlighted the vulnerability of hotel websites to cyberattacks and the need for improved security measures, such as removing booking information from URLs and implementing authentication protocols on confirmation pages.

The United States  Postal Service has a lot of ways to move the  484.8 million pieces of mail  it handles every day. In rural Alaska, postal workers run hovercraft, prop planes, and the occasional parachute. They pilot boats in the Louisiana bayou and snowmobiles in Colorado, Minnesota, Montana, Utah, and Wisconsin. To reach the Havasupai Indian Reservation town of Supai at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, they go by mule train. And now, to carry the mail from Phoenix to Dallas, they’re letting  robots  do the work. Alex Davies  covers autonomous vehicles and other transportation machines for WIRED. Starting Tuesday,  self-driving trucks  built by startup TuSimple will haul trailers full of mail and packages all by themselves. Well, mostly by themselves: The 18-wheelers will have a certified driver and safety engineer aboard, who will handle the driving on surface streets and take control from the robot as needed. The pilot project will last two weeks and include five round trips between the cities’ distribution hubs. For the postal service, autonomy might help it reverse an ugly financial situation. The agency, which receives no tax dollars, has posted a loss every year for more than a decade. Its five-year strategic plan, covering 2017–2021, is full of talk about being open to innovative solutions. In February, it issued a request for information saying it was investigating how autonomous vehicles could fit into its fleet. It’s working with the University of Michigan on  a self-driving truck to handle rural routes . In a statement, a spokesperson called the pilot “just one of many ways the postal service is innovating and investing in its future.” TuSimple bills itself as a master of computer vision. Its cameras can see and identify threats about 1,000 meters away—more than half a mile and much farther than any lidar. 
 TuSimple For TuSimple, it’s the chance to make some (undisclosed) revenue, pick up some press coverage, and to test its technology against the rigors of a real-world delivery service. The startup, which has headquarters in San Diego and Beijing, bills itself as a master of  computer vision . Its cameras can see and identify threats about 1,000 meters away—more than half a mile and much farther than any  lidar   laser-scanning system . But this pilot is more of a logistical than a technological exam. To build a high-resolution record of three freeways in three states, TuSimple executed what founder and CTO Xiaodi Hou calls an “involuntary upgrade of our mapping infrastructure.” (It used human-driven cars to do that work.) For the 1,000-mile, 20-hour drive, it had to increase the truck’s hard drive storage space to handle all the data the system will produce. And it toughened up parts of the system like the server that  failed during a test ride WIRED took  last December. LEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to  Self-Driving Cars If that kind of problem does strike, TuSimple can’t take all day to get the vehicle back in action—not if it expects to keep its first customer happy and eventually bring in others. “These are the hard requirements that we will likely encounter in the future,” Hou says. For this pilot, the human driver will handle the truck on surface streets, but Hou says TuSimple is already looking to a second phase of the pilot, where the robot does all the work. Meanwhile, it’s 400-person team is working to expand the robot’s operating envelope. The system can handle high winds, night driving (handling high beams was a pain), and rain, Hou says, while ice on the road remains “a nasty problem.” If it never succeeds, the postal service has a team of mules up for the task.

Nintendo customers experiencing a widespread fault in its controllers may finally get some long-sought support.

Vice reports that an internal memo at the company will mandate a free repair policy for those who purchased faulty joy-Cons.

'Customers will no longer be requested to provide proof of purchase for Joy-Con repairs,' internal documents seen by Vice say.

For those customers who already purchased new Joy-Cons -- which can cost about $90 -- Nintendo will also reportedly offer reimbursement for their expense

'Additionally it is not necessary to confirm warranty status. If a customer requests a refund for a previously paid Joy-Con repair... confirm the prior repair and then issue a refund.'

While Nintendo has not addressed the policy shift publicly, Vice says documents show that the company is telling its support representatives to guide customers through a few trouble-shooting steps before offering a free repair.

The company will reportedly not ask for a warranty or a proof of purchase from customers.

Fortunately for those customers who already purchased new Joy-Cons -- which can cost about $90 -- Nintendo will also reportedly offer reimbursement for their expense.

One reporter for Vice tested the new policy out and after negotiating with a Nintendo Switch representative and being told to update the controllers' firmware, was granted a repair by the company for free.

JoyCon drift,' as it has come to be known, is a problem now widely experienced by owners of Nintendo's Switch console who use its configurable controller's called JoyCons.

Customers have complained of controllers that seem to operate of their own volition, making some games unplayable.

WHAT IS 'JOYCON DRIFT'? Gamers who use the Nintendo Switch have complained of a defect in their controllers dubbed 'JoyCon Drift.' The flaw causes the left joystick of the controller -- called JoyCons -- to register movement without being touched. In many cases the fault has rendered the controllers unusable by interfering with gameplay. Nintendo is now being sued for the issue as thousands report issues with their JoyCons which retail at about $80. Advertisement

Customers have documented -- some after just several months of use or less -- that an apparent defect in the JoyCons causes the their joystick to register movement even when it's not being engaged by the user.

The 'drift' seems to vary in severity and result, ranging from a subtle and mild annoyance to rendering some games completely unplayable.

A change in policy follows news of a class-action lawsuit filed by angry customers who report dealing with Joy-Con drift.

The suit, reported by Polygon, was filed by the law firm Chimicles Schwartz Kriner & Donaldson-Smith and marks a significant escalation by a growing chorus of unhappy customers.

According to one attorney who spoke to Polygon, in just the first 24 hours, the firm was contacted by 5,500 customers alleging complaints over their controllers' quality.",2023-11-29 21:41:29.365321+00:00,True,True,True,,0.952936161335557,Nintendo will fix faulty Joy-Cons for FREE amid thousands of complaints stemming from 'drift' glitch - Daily Mail,,"The software failure incident occurred with Nintendo's Joy-Con controllers, specifically the issue known as ""Joy-Con drift.""

Nintendo revealed two new Switch models in July. One is the more portable Switch Lite and the other is a new version of the original console with a longer battery life. Some current Switch owners, however, aren't happy with the system's controller and an issue known as ""drifting,"" which led to a lawsuit. A leaked memo from Nintendo says it will reportedly fix ""drifting"" Joy-Cons for free.

Law firm Chimicles Schwartz Kriner & Donaldson-Smith on Friday filed a lawsuit against Nintendo of America over Joy-Con ""drifting."" The complaint alleges that Nintendo marketed and sold the Switch and Joy-Con controllers despite being ""aware of the defect through online consumer complaints.""

Some Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons apparently don't return to center properly thus creating a constant input of a particular direction, or drifting. One thread on the Nintendo Switch subreddit had dozens of console owners complaining about the problem. One user mentioned that six of their eight Joy-Cons had the issue.

Nintendo of America says it's aware of the Joy-Con drift issue.

""At Nintendo, we take great pride in creating quality products and we are continuously making improvements to them,"" a company representative said in an emailed statement Tuesday. ""We want our consumers to have fun with Nintendo Switch, and if anything falls short of this goal we always encourage them to visit http://support.nintendo.com so we can help.""

On the official Nintendo support forums, there are dozens of threads from owners experiencing drifting on their Joy-Cons. One moderator advised users to follow the steps on how to fix Joy-Con drift on the company's support page.

An internal memo says Nintendo reportedly advised customer representatives to offer free repairs for malfunctioning Joy-Cons and give refunds to those who paid a service fee to have them fixed.

A partner with the law firm behind the lawsuit says Switch owners have high expectations for Nintendo products.

""This drift issue simply prevents consumers from playing games in the way they are supposed to be able to on this device,"" Benjamin F. Johns said Tuesday. ""It is extremely frustrating and I can understand why so many people are upset. We look forward to prosecuting this case.""

The firm has a signup page for Nintendo Switch owners who are experiencing similar problems with their Joy-Cons. They're seeking class-action status for the case, which was filed in the US District Court for the Western District of Washington in Seattle.

The latest General Motors recall affects a decent chunk of trucks in Canada, and while the US and Canada tend to share models between the two nations, it doesn't seem like GM is ready to announce a similar recall in the truck-hungry US market just yet.

GM issued a recall in Canada for approximately 160,000 examples of the 2014-2018 Chevy Silverado, the 2015-2018 Chevy Silverado HD, the 2014-2018 GMC Sierra and the 2015-2019 GMC Sierra HD. The recall notice on Transport Canada's website does not mention if specific VIN or production ranges are affected.

The issue stems from trucks equipped with a power sliding rear window. In these vehicles, the circuit overseeing the rear window defroster might overheat. If this happens, it might create some smoke, melt some components or even start a fire. Because of the risk of injury associated with the defect, a recall was initiated.

As for the fix, General Motors is still working on a final corrective action, which will likely involve some degree of part replacement. In the meantime, owners have been instructed to take their trucks to dealerships, where technicians will pull the defroster's fuse, rendering it inoperable. Thankfully, it's not winter right now. Owners will receive an initial notification for the stopgap repair, with a second notification to follow when a permanent fix is found.

What's interesting is that this has not spurred a similar recall in the US, but that doesn't mean GM isn't looking into it. ""In rare instances, areas of high electric resistance on the rear defrost circuit, caused in part by mechanical stress from opening and closing the rear power window, intrusion of debris and high usage of the rear defroster may, over time, generate heat which could melt the areas surrounding the circuit,"" said a GM spokesperson in an emailed statement. ""In very rare instances, this heat could cause a non-propagating fire, smoke, and melting. GM is continuing its investigation for similar vehicles sold in the US, however, allegations of fires stemming from this condition are rare and, when investigated, GM has found evidence of smoke and localized melting conditions, but no fire propagation. Further, the rate of occurrence in the Canadian vehicle population, given the climate and usage patterns, is significantly higher than the rate of occurrence in the US.""

The affected models include the 2014-2018 Chevy Silverado, the 2015-2018 Chevy Silverado HD, the 2014-2018 GMC Sierra, and the 2015-2019 GMC Sierra HD. The failure was related to the power sliding rear window circuit, specifically the rear window defroster. Due to a potential overheating issue, there was a risk of smoke, component melting, or even fire. As a result, a recall was initiated to address the defect and prevent injuries.

General Motors is currently working on a final corrective action, which will likely involve replacing certain parts. In the meantime, owners have been advised to take their trucks to dealerships, where technicians will disable the defroster by pulling its fuse. The company plans to send initial notifications for the temporary repair, followed by a second notification when a permanent fix is available.

It is worth noting that while a recall was issued in Canada, there has not been a similar recall in the US. However, General Motors is investigating the issue for vehicles sold in the US as well. The company stated that instances of fires related to this condition are rare, and evidence has only shown smoke and localized melting. The rate of occurrence in the Canadian vehicle population is significantly higher than in the US, likely due to climate and usage patterns.

The responsible entity for the software failure incident is General Motors, as they manufactured the affected trucks. The impacted entities are the owners of the recalled vehicles in Canada.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apple has agreed to pay up to $500 million in a class-action settlement over claims that it covertly slowed older iPhones to get users to upgrade.

A federal judge in California presiding over the group of lawsuits will be asked to approve the proposed settlement at a hearing in early April, according to a court filing on Friday.

The litigation centered on stealthy mobile software that slowed phones in the name of avoiding 'unintended power-offs' according to the company.

In December 2017, Apple admitted that iOS software was tweaked to slow performance of older iPhones whose battery life was deteriorating to prevent handsets from spontaneously shutting down.

Apple agreed to a settlement in a class-action lawsuit alleging it slowed the performance of older handsets including the iPhone 7 when battery life was deteriorating to encourage users to upgrade

Critics accused Apple of surreptitiously forcing users to buy phones sooner than necessary, and the outcry forced Apple to upgrade its software and offer steep discounts on battery replacements.

The proposed settlement calls for Apple to pay at least $310 million dollars, but no more than $500 million to compensate affected US iPhone owners and pay lawyers for the plaintiffs, according to court documents.

People who owned iPhone 7 models or older will get $25 for each handset, with the amount rising or falling depending on how many people file claims and costs of getting word to them.

Lawyers behind the suit aim to pocket $93 million of the settlement money plus another $1.5 million or so for out-of-pocket expenses, legal documents indicated.

France's consumer watchdog said last month that Apple had agreed to pay 25 million euros ($27.4 million) in a related case.

French prosecutors opened an inquiry in January 2018 at the request of the Halt Planned Obsolescence (HOP) association.

As batteries in all phones and gadgets age, they become less effective.

Meanwhile, as software becomes more advanced, it puts more of a strain on the battery and processor as the phone ages, and in come cases, this can cause phones to simply shut down.

Apple's performance management feature throttles some system components, such as the CPU and the GPU, as the battery degrades over time to prevent the device from randomly shutting down.

Previously, this was an automatic feature in every iPhone, but following outrage from users, Apple began giving them the option to turn it off in iOS 11.3.

Apple introduced new battery controls (pictured) as a response to backlash for slowing older models of iPhones. The controls give greater insight into battery health

An Apple statement at the time maintained that 'we have never - and would never - do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades.'

In May of last year Apple agreed to be more transparent with users when new software updates are likely to throttle or slow down the performance of their iPhones.

The tech giant signed an agreement with the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), a UK watchdog, that it would be 'clearer and more upfront' with users in the future.

As part of the agreement, Apple pledged to provide more accessible information about 'battery health and unexpected shutdowns.'

It also pledged to give guidance on how iPhone users can maximize their device's battery health, such as changing settings, turning on low power mode or replacing the battery.",2023-12-01 13:46:16.619869+00:00,True,True,True,,0.8999068468246483,Apple will pay up to $500 million in lawsuit that claims it intentionally slowed down iPhones - Daily Mail,,"The software failure incident occurred in December 2017 when Apple admitted that its iOS software was intentionally slowing down the performance of older iPhones.

102550,https://www.cnet.com/tech/tech-industry/coordinated-twitter-hack-hits-elon-musk-obama-kanye-west-bill-gates-and-more-in-bitcoin-scam/,2022-02-15 11:50:07+00:00,https://www.cnet.com,,"Published on None. Bitcoin scammers targeted the Twitter accounts of Elon Musk , Bill Gates , Kanye West , Barack Obama and other famous tech executives, entertainers and politicians on Wednesday in what appears to be a large-scale hack. Apple, Uber and other businesses were also caught up in the sprawling hack, which Twitter later attributed to a social engineering attack on its employees.

Twitter accounts with millions of followers seemed to have been compromised, raising concerns about whether the company is doing enough to protect the security of its users. While cryptocurrency scams aren't a new problem for Twitter, the size of Wednesday's attack is unusual.

""I'm feeling generous because of Covid-19,"" a now-deleted tweet from Musk's account reads. ""I'll double any BTC payment sent to my BTC address for the next hour. Good luck, and stay safe out there!""

Similar tweets were sent through the Twitter account belonging to Gates, the billionaire philanthropist and Microsoft co-founder. ""I am doubling all payments sent to my BTC address for the next 30 minutes. You send $1,000, I send you back $2,000,"" the tweet, which was deleted, read.

The scam tweets would periodically vanish, only to reappear minutes later.

A spokesperson for Gates confirmed the tweet wasn't sent by the billionaire.

""We can confirm that this tweet was not sent by Bill Gates. This appears to be part of a larger issue that Twitter is facing. Twitter is aware and working to restore the account,"" the spokesperson said in a statement.

Obama's account tweeted a message similar to the one shared by the Musk and Gates accounts. In a tweet sent to his 120 million followers, Obama's account tweeted that the former president was giving back because of the novel coronavirus and that he would double all bitcoins sent to his address for the next 30 minutes.

It wasn't immediately clear how the hack was conducted or how many accounts were impacted, although Twitter did provide an update late Wednesday, indicating that while its investigation into the hack was ongoing, the company had determined it to be the result of a ""coordinated social engineering attack.""

""We detected what we believe to be a coordinated social engineering attack by people who successfully targeted some of our employees with access to internal systems and tools,"" Twitter said in a tweet. (For tips on how to secure your Twitter account, see this CNET story.)

But for the hack's first two hours, Twitter didn't have a handle on the incident. In a tweet, the company said some users might not be able to tweet or reset their password as they reviewed and tackled the problem. Twitter also began removing tweets of screenshots showing internal tools that were possibly used in the attack.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted Wednesday evening that it was ""a tough day for us at Twitter"" and promised to share the company's findings when it completed its diagnosis of the hack.

Some users who tried to tweet got an error message, saying this appeared to apply only to verified users with ""blue checks.""

""This request looks like it might be automated. To protect our users from spam and other malicious activity, we can't complete this action now. Please try again later,"" the message read. Twitter didn't respond to questions about whether only verified accounts couldn't tweet.

Twitter has now removed this restriction. Users with verified accounts are now able to tweet again, but Twitter Support stated that functionality may ""come and go.""

""We're working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible,"" the tweet read.

The scam tweets end with a link pointing to where unsuspecting readers can send bitcoin. As of Wednesday afternoon, a spot check of the BTC address from the tweets shows a total received of 12.30776555 BTC, or roughly $113,572.

The Wednesday hack isn't the first time that Twitter accounts have been compromised by scammers. In 2018, hackers took control of the verified Twitter accounts of Target and Google's G Suite. In that attack, hackers exploited a third-party marketing service, not its own system, according to the company.

Even Dorsey hasn't been immune from hacking. In 2019, Dorsey's account was compromised and the hackers tweeted out sexist, racist and anti-Semitic comments. Twitter said there was a security issue with Dorsey's mobile provider that allowed the hackers to compose and send tweets from his account via text message. In a tactic known as SIM swapping, a hacker bribes an employee of a mobile provider to get them to switch the numbers tied to the SIM card. That allows them to bypass security measures such as two-factor authentication.

Politicians urged others not to fall for the Bitcoin scam, and some reached out to Dorsey for answers. Shortly after the hack occurred, Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, asked Dorsey in a letter to respond to questions such as whether the attack threatened the security of President Donald Trump's account and its impact on the security of other users.

""I am concerned that this event may represent not merely a coordinated set of separate hacking incidents but rather a successful attack on the security of Twitter itself,"" he said in the letter. ""A successful attack on your system's servers represents a threat to all of your users' privacy and data security.""

On Thursday, Sen. Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, called on Twitter to explain how the hack happened.

""While this scheme appears financially motivated and, as a result, presents a threat to Twitter users, imagine if these bad actors had a different intent to use powerful voices to spread disinformation to potentially interfere with our elections, disrupt the stock market, or upset our international relations,"" Markey said in a statement. ""That is why Twitter must fully disclose what happened and what it is doing to ensure this never happens again.""

Musk and Gates weren't the only high-profile accounts that appear to have been compromised. Scammy tweets were seen in the feeds for fast food chain Wendy's, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, philanthropist Warren Buffett, musician Wiz Khalifa, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and celebrity Kim Kardashian. Scammers also appear to have targeted athletes, such as former professional boxer Floyd Mayweather, and even a popular parody account for God, along with cryptocurrency businesses.

""ALL MAJOR CRYPTO TWITTER ACCOUNTS HAVE BEEN COMPROMISED,"" tweeted Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange. ""We are investigating and hope to have more information shortly.""

""WARNING: @Gemini's twitter account, along with a number of other crypto twitter accounts, has been hacked,"" added Tyler Winklevoss, echoing his twin brother and Gemini co-founder's concern. ""This has resulted in @Gemini, @coinbase, @binance, and @CoinDesk, tweeting about a scam partnership with CryptoForHealth. DO NOT CLICK THE LINK! These tweets are SCAMS.""

Slack, the popular messaging platform used by millions of people worldwide, restored service after experiencing a major disruption on Monday as many employees in the United States returned to work after the holidays. The company initially called the service problem an “incident” in a statement on its website on Monday morning, then upgraded it to an outage an hour later. “Customers may have trouble loading channels or connecting to Slack at this time,” the statement said. “Our team is investigating and we will follow up with more information as soon as we have it.” At 3:10 p.m.,  the company wrote : “We’re truly sorry for the disruption today. We’ll be back with a summary of this issue.” A Slack representative said the company was “seeing improvements with error rates on our side, and we believe affected customers should be able to access Slack.” The company later said it had resolved issues with its calendar apps and email notifications. The representative could not say how many of Slack’s more than 10 million daily users were affected or what had caused the disruption.  The website Downdetector, which tracks internet disruptions, recorded a spike in reported problems with Slack at about 10 a.m. Eastern time, and the company posted its first statement about the problem at 10:14 a.m. Later in the afternoon, the  spike appeared to have subsided . During the outage, users could not send messages, load channels, make calls or even log in to the service, and some had problems with their calendars and notifications. The outage sent many people either to Slack’s competitors, like Google or Zoom’s video services, or back to phone calls and emails — tools that could  feel antiquated  to some employees who, while working from home for much of the last year, have grown used to the convenience and immediacy of the Slack app on their laptop or smartphone.  Service began to resume for some users around 12:20 p.m. Eastern.  “Some customers may be able to connect, but may also experience degraded performance,” Slack said at 1 p.m.   Video Slack attempts to load a message thread during the outage. Credit Credit... As it has grown in recent years, Slack has become an essential workplace tool, with many users in media organizations and companies that have shifted to working from home because of the coronavirus pandemic. More than 750,000 companies use the service, according to Slack, which became an independent, publicly traded company in mid-2019.  Salesforce, a company that sells marketing and sales software, announced in December that  it would buy Slack for $27.7 billion  in cash and stock, the latest in a series of major deals showing the demand for tools that allow people to work remotely. Adobe said in November that it planned to acquire the management software company Workfront for $1.5 billion, and Atlassian, which sells tools for developers, said it would buy the enterprise services business Mindville for an undisclosed amount.  The high-profile deals indicated intense competition in the market for workplace software. Other companies with such products, including Airtable, Dropbox and Smartsheet, may be among the potential targets for acquisitions by powerful tech companies. Executives at Slack, which was founded in 2010, had rejected such offers in the past. Slack has also faced increasing competition, especially from Microsoft, which offers a collaboration product called Teams. In July, Slack  filed a complaint with the European Commission  that claimed that Microsoft had unfairly bundled Teams with its Microsoft Office work products, including Word, Excel and PowerPoint. Though outages were once fairly common for internet companies, especially start-ups that grew quickly, they have become more rare as several tech giants, like Google and Facebook, have built networks of interconnected data centers. But major firms have experienced widespread problems in recent months, highlighting how reliant many companies, schools and governments have become on those networks.  In September, Google services, including Gmail, Hangouts, Maps and YouTube,  briefly crashed ,  as did Slack  and a  suite of Microsoft services , including Outlook, Office 365 and Teams. In December, Google suffered  another outage  with its apps that lasted about 45 minutes. And in August, an outage involving the video service Zoom  caused problems for several hours  on what was the first day of school for many students.",2023-12-03 13:17:32.359451+00:00,True,True,True,,0.799191494023682,Slack Is Restored - The New York Times,Slack Restores Service After Major Disruption,"The software failure incident occurred on January 4, 2021, when Slack, the popular messaging platform, experienced a major disruption.

The hackers threatened to release the games' source code, along with documents from the Polish game studio's accounting, legal and other departments if they don't ""come to an agreement."" It appears the hackers weren't kidding.

An auction appears on a hacker forum for the source code of one of CD Projekt's card game, Gwent according to The Verge Thursday. The thieves are looking for $1 million as a starting bid or $7 million to buy it outright. Cybersecurity firm Kela believe the auction is legit.

CD Projekt doesn't think any personal data of players or users of its services has been compromised, and said it won't give in to the hackers' demands or negotiate with them.

The ransom note alluded to Cyberpunk's rocky launch in December. Console versions of CD Project's massively hyped sci-fi game were beset with performance issues and bugs, even on the next-gen PS5 and Xbox Series X.

The game studio recommended former employees enable fraud alerts for their personal information, but it had no evidence that those details were accessed by the hackers, according to a tweet Tuesday afternoon.

Sony and Microsoft both removed Cyberpunk from their digital stores and offered refunds to unhappy customers after widespread reports that the game was nearly unplayable on base PS4 and Xbox One hardware (the original 2013 versions of the consoles).

The developer's co-founder ultimately acknowledged in an apology video that the console version of its game ""did not meet the quality standard we wanted it to meet"" and outlined its plans for fixing the problems through patches.",2023-12-03 16:01:49.330366+00:00,True,True,True,,0.7852234041724063,"Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt hit by ransomware attack, source code leaked - CNET","CD Projekt Red's Network Hacked, Source Code and Documents Stolen","The software failure incident occurred when CD Projekt Red, the developer of Cyberpunk 2077, experienced a network hack.

They threatened to release the source code and other documents if an agreement was not reached.

CD Projekt Red recommended former employees enable fraud alerts for their personal information, although there was no evidence that the hackers accessed those details.

Being a Power Ranger was always a sweet gig, and amid the coronavirus pandemic, it's a job that the new heroes of Power Rangers Dino Fury aren't taking lightly.

I spoke with actors Russell Curry (who plays Red Ranger Zayto), Kai Moya (Blue Ranger Ollie), Hunter Deno (Pink Ranger Amelia), Tessa Rao (Green Ranger Izzy) and Chance Perez (Black Ranger Javi) about their journey through auditions on Zoom, having to quarantine before filming to working with Power Rangers' veteran-filled crew. We also talked about what it was like to watch the first episode that premiered on Nickelodeon last week.

This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. Throughout the interview we also have an exclusive clip and first look images of the second episode of Power Rangers Dino Fury, titled Sporix Unleashed. The episode will feature Kai's character Ollie attempt a plan to help his team, but without asking for their assistance. When the monsters take advantage of Ollie's idea, he learns the value of working with his new teammates. The episode will premiere on Nickelodeon Saturday at 8 a.m. ET and PT.

CNET: When I spoke with Dino Fury executive producer Simon Bennett last week we were going over the differences in the audition process: Having to use Zoom instead of in-person meetings, what was that process like for each of you?

Hunter: For Dino Fury, Kai and I had the most similar story. We started back in March with our first taped audition and we found out Aug. 13, so it was a long process but it was rewarding and it was Kai's birthday when we found out.

Kai: Everyone had it different. Me and Hunter's were in March, and the next audition in June and then July and August. For the others it was a little different.

Tessa: I did a tape in May and did another tape a little while after and didn't hear anything back for months, and got asked to go in for another character quite soon before I got the role and then the day after was asked to audition for a Ranger again and five, six days later was cast and moved to Auckland. So mine was a very quick process as compared to the others.

Russell: As actors during this pandemic, our process wasn't that much different from what the casting process is for anything else during the pandemic. It's almost all virtual. The difference between doing it on tape from your home versus going to a casting office is actually good in some ways and a lot harder in others. You don't get to form those personal relationships with people as much, but you can take as many tries as you want.

With my casting process I did my first self tape in about July and then I heard absolutely nothing and then my agent calls me on Aug. 5, and was like ""Hey you're free today and you're still interested in Power Rangers and you're down to go to New Zealand?"" and I was like, ""duh."" She said, ""you have a meeting with the producers tonight if you can make it"" and I was like, ""I'll be there obviously,"" and then I find out the next day. I probably had the shortest casting process, it was pretty nice.

Chance: I got the first audition at the beginning of June, sent it in and my hair was almost down to my shoulders, I looked like a rat. It was really long and still had blonde highlights so imagine that. I got a callback, sent in another one the next week and the week after that there was a meeting in Marina Del Rey, where we met Chip, who was a producer for Power Rangers. And the week after that we did a Zoom meeting where we auditioned in front of Simon Bennett, who is the executive producer on the show, and that was probably the most intimidating part of the process but then [I] got the role. So that was mine. It all happened in over a month.

Hunter: Kai, did you have a meeting in the park?

Kai: I did, I did have a socially distant meeting in the park.

Hunter: Everything else was either Zoom or a tape. But yes, we had a meeting in the park as well, about 6 feet apart.

And after being cast, what was the quarantine period to enter New Zealand like for the four of you that flew in from the US? (Tessa is from New Zealand.)

Hunter: We all flew in and immediately got escorted to a government quarantine facility. It wasn't too bad because we got to schedule an hour of walk and an hour of terrace time every day. We would try to schedule our stuff at the same time so we could semi-hang out -- obviously 6 feet apart, masks, gloves and everything, but try to schedule them at the same time so we can at least hang out.

Kai: Part of me misses that life sometimes: Waking up to the doorbell ringing with food, pancakes, waffles. Nice.

Tessa: I'm so jealous because I had to do quarantine because I came back from the States. But I did it earlier than the hotel, so I did it at home. And there were pros to that too, don't get me wrong, but it sounds so luxurious to just stay in a room away from my parents for two weeks.

After clearing quarantine, what is it like now living in a country that generally doesn't have community spread of COVID-19?

Chance: It feels more normal now. When we first got here when everyone was still wearing masks and then it became a point where you don't have to wear masks anymore, and honestly that felt so strange to me because we've been wearing masks in the States for so long, I'm going to bring one just in case.

Hunter: That's how I felt last week when we went into a little lockdown because we've been here for so long without masks and now we've had to wear masks. It was just like, wow, this is a good place to be.

Russell: It's normal: When there's no community threat of coronavirus we live a normal life. It was really weird to adjust to not wearing them but the speed at which it became really normal for me to not wear that mask was really fast. I became very comfortable very quickly, to the point where when we did have a lockdown it was like ""aw, come on."" But this is how the rest of the world lives, so count your blessings and shut up.

Hunter: Since we're COVID-free there's no restrictions. Nothing is closed down because of COVID, it's pretty much like it was before COVID -- [except] the possibility of having to go into a Level 2 or Level 3 [lockdown] just around the corner is always lingering right there.

Tessa: You start to get complacent, and then suddenly there's a meeting about something that's happened.

What are some of the biggest surprises you've learned since you started filming?

Hunter: I'm not a morning person so I had to get used to most mornings waking up at 4:30 a.m., but now it's getting to the point where on weekends I'm getting up at 6 a.m. on my own time.

Kai: The biggest thing for me was ADR. I've never been in a studio for recording your voice and things like that and having to yell for an hour and a half. It really kills me, I'm out of there and I can barely talk. That's the biggest one that I still have to get used to now.

Russell: It's an intense schedule, that's kind of the biggest thing, it's something I was doing my best to mentally prepare for. We knew we would be working like six days a week and long hours and all that good stuff. I don't know if there was anything that's been a big surprise but there's just been adjustments because nobody lives their life like that.

Tessa: I was not surprised as such but it was an adjustment to realize that I had to prioritize time that I wasn't thinking about Power Rangers every day. There's such a big part of our lives that is taken up by this project -- which is amazing, but I thought it would just be everything and it would be great, but I realized quite quickly that I needed to set aside time where I was doing something for me or doing something for somebody else or doing something that wasn't actually connected to that just to give myself a breather. And then when I get back into it I can go ""Alright everyone let's go!"".

Chance: I would second that, I think it's important to set aside time for yourself as well to kind of decompress and get out of that mindset for a moment. But when you come back to the work week you grind, grind, grind. Let's do it.

A lot of the Power Rangers crew have been on the show for a long time. What's been a highlight so far working with them?

Russell: One of the stunt performers named Kazu -- he's originally from Japan and came to New Zealand and he's been working on Power Rangers in New Zealand since 2002, I think. He'll show us his stunt reel and all the amazing fight choreography that he's been doing for years. He's one of the people who taught us a lot of our fight choreography and stunt training. It's just really cool to see how much history there is. We get to work with the director Yuji, who's been on the show since the very beginning, so just the different stories they tell and that aura they bring to the series and how cool it is to be here is really fun.

Hunter: I feel like the stunt team has been around a little longer than some of the crew, so I feel we get a little more insight from them when we're able to. I always ask the crew the very first couple of months how long have you been working on Power Rangers just to see what the dynamic is of the crew. Most of them have been around for some time.

Normally there would have been a Power Morphicon convention that would have introduced you all to fans and to other Power Rangers alumni. Have you been able to talk to earlier Power Rangers cast members for advice?

Chance: We've talked to some Rangers. We've played some Smash Bros with Brennan and Yoshi [from Dino Charge].

Kai: I think all of us were able to get in touch with our same color rangers that were Power Rangers in the past. They pretty much reached out to us and they're so welcoming of us joining the family. They all gave us some advice and time to time check in on us, which is really cool because they've all been to New Zealand for a long time and will not only talk about Power Rangers but, ""you should eat at this place or check out that place.""

Being suited up for the first time was a huge event for the Dino Fury cast. Hasbro

What was it like to see your Power Ranger suits for the first time?

Hunter: When I went in for my first fitting, you have to walk through a few rooms of clothes and they have stations of sewing kits and [you can see] how they make the suits. I had walked and turned my head and saw my suit for the first time hanging before I put it on, and was like, ""wow that's me, I'm going to be in that suit."" So I asked, ""is that specifically my suit?"" and when I tried it on I just like look in the mirror and take it all in: Wow, I'm a Power Ranger. I'm not just putting this suit on for the fun of it, I get to play this character, which is so iconic.

Chance: It's going to be one of those moments that I remember forever, personally. I was watching Power Rangers when I was a kid and I had Power Rangers underwear and a onesie. Power Rangers has always been a huge part of my life, so when I got this and I went into the wardrobe fitting that day and they were like, ""you get to try on the suit today,"" I just remember looking in the mirror and going, ""wow, this is my life right now.""

Tessa: So surreal, and seeing photos of it afterwards is like, ""OK!"" So weird. Great weird, but so surreal.

Kai: I have a funnier story for it, just to switch it up. Mine, when I zip it up all the way, it's actually too tight for my neck. But when trying it on they zip it all the way up and I was like [gestures tightness in neck] and that's when they make adjustments to see what they have to do to make it fit better. When looking at it I was like, ""I think it's a little too tight,"" but [they said], ""it looks good, can we keep it?"" I was like, ""OK, we'll keep it.""

Russell: I have a similar story, it took many fittings for it to get completely right. There was some little mistake and it snowballed, I had to get fitted into my suit so many times before it looked exactly right. And then when it did, we did a photo shoot, all of us together. The day that we're just hanging out everybody in our suits and taking pictures and doing TikTok videos, that was one of the most fun memorable days of this entire experience.

Hunter: Before we came to New Zealand they sent a picture of a person and marked where we had to measure for our suits, and I just remember I had my mom measure me. I was just like, ""wow I'm getting measured for a superhero suit right now."" Not only did my mom get to be a part of the process and fit me into it and everything. To get into the suit and have it pretty much almost fit -- it was just cool going from actually getting measured on our own to being in the suit as well.

Is there anything else about filming so far you wanted to note?

Hunter: For me, our days wouldn't be the same if the crew wasn't as incredible as they are. I feel they should be shouted out in every interview because the crew does so much behind the camera that nobody ever sees.

Russell: I don't know if we'll ever have a crew as amazing as this crew for the rest of our careers.

Tessa: It was a really amazing moment to watch the first episode and get to see all of their work that we don't get to see on each day because we're standing in front of the camera doing it. When you finally get to see the final product and you get to see all of the hard work from all of the cast, all of the crew, all of the post-production, everyone involved and it's all together, and you know those people, you get to point out that must have been him or that must have been her.

Hunter: We're not only one family as a cast but the entire production is a family that when we went into lockdown last week we were all upset that we couldn't hug each other.

WASHINGTON, March 11 (Reuters) - Ransom-seeking hackers have begun taking advantage of a recently disclosed flaw in Microsoft’s widely used mail server software, the company said early Thursday - a serious escalation that could portend widespread digital disruption.

The disclosure, initially made on Twitter by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) security program manager Phillip Misner and later confirmed by the Redmond, Washington-based company, is the realization of worries that have been coursing through the security community for days.

Since March 2, when Microsoft announced the discovery of serious vulnerabilities in its Exchange software, experts have warned that it was only a matter of time before ransomware gangs began using them to shake down organizations across the internet.

Misner didn't immediately respond to follow-up messages and Microsoft did not return emails seeking further comment. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the FBI also didn't immediately respond.

Even though the security holes announced by Microsoft have since been fixed, organizations worldwide have failed to patch their software, leaving them open to exploitation. Experts attribute the sluggish pace of many customers’ updates in part to the complexity of Exchange’s architecture and lack of expertise. In Germany alone, officials have said that up to 60,000 networks remained vulnerable.

All manner of hackers have begun taking advantage of the holes - one security firm recently counted 10 separate hacking groups using the flaws - but ransomware operators are among the most feared.

Those groups work by locking users out of their devices and data unless the victims cough up big chunks of digital currency. They now potentially have access ""into a huge number of vulnerable systems,"" said Brett Callow of cybersecurity company Emsisoft.

He said more modest companies - many of which lack the ability or awareness to update their software - could be particularly affected by the latest variant of ransomware.

""This is a potentially serious risk to small businesses,"" he said.

112723,https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/08/tech/india-internet-homegrown-apps/index.html,2021-03-08 08:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnn.com,,"Published on 2021-03-08 00:00:00. CNN Business —

While Twitter finds itself in a prolonged standoff with the Indian government over the company’s refusal to take down certain accounts, a senior executive of a very similar Indian social network says the sudden attention on his app has been “overwhelming.”

“It feels like … you’ve just been put in the finals of the World Cup suddenly and everyone’s watching you and the team,” Mayank Bidawatka, co-founder of Koo, told CNN Business.

Koo, touted by India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi and used enthusiastically by several officials and ministries in his government, has been downloaded 3.3 million times so far this year, per app analytics firm Sensor Tower. It’s a promising start for a company founded less than a year ago, but less than Twitter’s 4.2 million Indian downloads during the same period.

However, the Indian social network, which sports a bird logo familiar to any Twitter user, was downloaded more times than Twitter in the month of February — when the Indian government called out the US company for not doing enough to block accounts sharing what it called “incendiary and baseless” hashtags around a protest by farmers against new agricultural laws.

“We’re building as fast as we can,” Bidawatka said.

Over the past couple of years, the Modi government has ratcheted up its pressure on global tech companies. It recently imposed stringent restrictions on the likes of Facebook, Twitter and YouTube and reportedly threatened their employees with jail time, less than a year after banning dozens of Chinese apps, including TikTok and WeChat.

Against that backdrop, homegrown alternatives to many of those services have cropped up to try to take advantage of a burgeoning techno-nationalism — and some, like Koo, are quickly gaining traction. The two most downloaded apps in India so far in 2021 are TikTok-esque short video platforms MX Taka Tak and Moj, ahead of Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp, according to app analytics firm Sensor Tower.

Bidawatka praised Twitter’s service and said the government backlash against it and other tech platforms is “unfortunate.” But he doesn’t deny that the government’s clash with Twitter has given Koo and other Indian apps a boost, adding that local apps have a better understanding of the market and can step in where big global tech firms fall short.

“A lot of the global tech giants have India as a part of their roadmap as far as growth is concerned, but they’re also a little worried about making big changes to a very stable global product to cater to a market like that,” he said. “We have the talent, we have the resources, some of us have the experience, there’s funding available for fulfilling dreams like these. And these are pretty large dreams, we’re talking about creating products that are very relevant to the second largest internet population in the world.”

Sending a message

Several governments are now reckoning with, and seeking to rein in, the power of large global tech companies. Australia, Europe and the United States have floated regulations in recent months that aim to blunt some of that power.

India is no different in targeting big tech firms, but much of its focus in recent months has been around protecting its national security and sovereignty — and it has a lot of leverage. The country’s 750 million internet users, with hundreds of millions more yet to come online for the first time, are crucial to Big Tech’s global growth prospects. Facebook (FB), Google (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and several others have already poured billions of dollars into growing their Indian operations.

The Modi government’s regulations have created a chilling effect on those companies and emboldened Indian apps to position themselves as a better fit for the country’s users. The big question now is whether the government simply promotes and encourages made-in-India apps or creates a regulatory environment where they’re the only ones left standing.

In banning Chinese apps, in particular, India used China’s own tech playbook against it. The world’s most populous nation has largely sealed off its billion-plus people from foreign tech companies for decades, using a massive censorship apparatus known as The Great Firewall. Google and Facebook have both made overtures to China in an effort to be let into the world’s biggest market, but to no avail. Instead, China’s internet ecosystem is made up of homegrown companies such as Tencent (TCEHY), Weibo (WB) and Alibaba (BABA), some of which have become large global players.

India’s move to shut down Chinese tech firms definitely gave Indian competitors a boost — particularly those seeking to replace TikTok, which had more than 200 million users in the country before it was banned. Meanwhile, the government has actively sought to boost homegrown apps: Koo and Chingari were both among the winners of an “app innovation challenge” that received prize money from the government.

These shifting dynamics in India’s digital marketplace are yet another warning sign of what’s been dubbed the splinternet, foreshadowing a possible world where each country sticks to its own apps and abandons the open and global nature of the internet. For now, however, these homegrown apps may find it difficult to compete at the same level unless the government decides to ban Facebook and Twitter, too.

“If the party is on Twitter, a few people on Koo won’t matter,” Mishi Choudhary, legal director at the New York-based Software Freedom Law Center, told CNN Business. “The ability to follow global news and forge connections across borders is a crucial feature for the success of these platforms and must not be overlooked.”

But unseating Big Tech may not strictly be the point, says Anupam Srivastava, a nonresident fellow at the Stimson Center, a Washington DC-based think tank and a former head of the Indian government’s investment agency, Invest India. It’s also about sending a message to companies like Facebook and Twitter: Access to India’s massive internet shouldn’t be taken for granted.

“The effort is to tell them you’re not indispensable,” he said.

The China conundrum

Soon after Modi called on the country to become “self-reliant” in May last year, short-form video app Chingari began marketing itself as a homegrown alternative to TikTok. It was downloaded 2.5 million times in six days.

A few weeks later, when India banned TikTok and dozens of other Chinese-owned apps after a military conflict with China escalated, Chingari really exploded, with 8 million downloads the day of the ban, then 7 million downloads the day after, according to cofounder Sumit Ghosh.

“It was crazy, crazy stuff,” Ghosh told CNN Business in an interview last year soon after the ban. “Banning TikTok was never the business plan for us,” he added. “We were growing organically.”

But he fully endorses the Indian government’s rationale for the ban, arguing that China and its companies can’t be trusted, and Indian user data needs to be in Indian hands to avoid a “security risk.”

While India was willing to ban Chinese apps, there may be limits to how far its government can go with services from other countries. As a democratically elected government, and one that has far closer ties to the United States than to China, it’s unlikely India can completely close off its internet and kick out America’s biggest tech companies in the near future.

“Undergirding all of US-India engagement … is a very strong and growing government-to-government defense, security and high technology cooperation,” Srivastava said. In contrast, India sees itself “in an existential sort of struggle with China” and the app ban was “aimed as a direct message.”

Chingari plans to focus on its home country until it hits at least 100 million users. The app does eventually have global ambitions, but Ghosh said it is committed to “data sovereignty,” with plans to store users’ data within their respective countries.

That may make it more difficult to train the app’s recommendation algorithm, considering the data will be more fragmented than if it were all processed in the same place. But it’s a price Chingari is willing to pay.

Additionally, hedging against geopolitical risks could help Chingari avoid being banned in other markets the way TikTok and others were banned in India.

“India is generally friendly with every country,” Ghosh said, “but you never know.”",2023-12-03 18:50:49.740735+00:00,True,False,,,,India is trying to build its own internet - CNN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

115362,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jun/08/internet-outage-illustrates-lack-of-resilience-at-heart-of-critical-services,2021-06-08 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,,"Published on 2021-06-08 00:00:00. Tuesday morning’s 45-minute internet outage, which knocked out the Gov.uk domain as well as a string of publishers and other websites, cannot easily be dismissed as an isolated event. It demonstrates a lack of resilience at the heart of critical government services.

Anybody wanting to book a Covid test in the late morning on Gov.uk would have struggled. There is an alternative method, by phone, but who knows the number to call: 119? Government services that once delivered by form and post, then call centres, now only really exist through online connections.

The problem appears to have stemmed from Fastly, a website provider that, ironically, exists to prevent outages. Once Fastly discovered the cause, it released a fix. It will have been a relief that the problems lasted for less than an hour.

What is unclear is if the government or any of the other websites affected had an alternative solution that would have allowed them to be back online promptly.

Britain’s government has been developing online government services over the past two decades, a trend accelerated by the pandemic, where for example use of the test-and-trace app has become a necessity within a few short months.

Yet, Paddy McGuinness, a former deputy director of national security until 2018, observes that “technology that starts out as nice to have is rapidly become fundamental to the way we operate. But too often resilience is an afterthought.”

Some parts of Britain’s national infrastructure, such as nuclear power, have a high degree of resilience built in from the start for safety reasons. But that has not been the case with other economically useful or practically significant services, not least the growing amount of business undertaken online.

A couple of months earlier, McGuinness warned that the UK’s recently published Integrated Review of defence and foreign policy gave insufficient weight to homeland security or “how vulnerability can be reduced at home”. It was arguably too easy to focus on military hardware or foreign policy priorities, while, as happened with the pandemic, de-emphasising the threats the UK actually faces.

It is a point not lost on hostile states, in particular Russia, which has pursued a sustained campaign of increasingly sophisticated hacking against the west in the past three years. Although there is no immediate evidence that the disruption to Fastly was caused by a hostile state, the Kremlin has demonstrated it is willing to exploit relatively obscure but widely available software.

Last year, Russian state sponsored hackers quietly penetrated the Orion IT network management tool made by SolarWinds, and have repeatedly used it to steal secrets from a range of US federal agencies including the Treasury, the Department of Commerce and even the National Nuclear Security Administration.

And while it might be argued that Russia would not want to disrupt public services and normal life, it was North Korea that is believed to have been behind the WannaCry computer virus that badly affected large parts of the NHS in 2017. It was not intended to directly target the NHS, but the impact of the rogue software was real enough: about 50 trusts were forced to turn patients away for appointments and even surgeries.

Britain’s government and security establishment says it is a world leader in computer security, with politicians often highlighting the country’s National Cyber Security Centre. But as the Fastly network outage reveals: new dependencies and new vulnerabilities are emerging and it is not obvious if those responsible for homeland security are always one step ahead.",2023-12-04 04:51:49.183188+00:00,True,True,True,,0.9156806459133823,Internet outage illustrates lack of resilience at heart of critical services - The Guardian,,"The software failure incident occurred on Tuesday morning and lasted for approximately 45 minutes. The system that failed was the Gov.uk domain, as well as several other websites and publishers. The cause of the failure was attributed to Fastly, a website provider that experienced an outage despite its purpose of preventing such incidents. Fastly was able to identify and fix the problem, bringing the affected websites back online. 

The impact of the failure was significant, particularly for government services that heavily rely on online connections. Users attempting to book a Covid test on Gov.uk during the late morning would have encountered difficulties. While there is an alternative method of booking by phone, the number to call (119) may not have been widely known. This incident highlights the lack of resilience in critical government services that have increasingly shifted to online platforms.

The responsible entity for the failure was Fastly, the website provider. It is unclear if the government or the other affected websites had alternative solutions in place to quickly restore their online services. The incident raises concerns about the resilience of online government services, which have become increasingly essential, especially during the pandemic.

The impacted entities include the Gov.uk domain, as well as various publishers and websites that rely on Fastly's services. The article also mentions the potential vulnerability of the UK's national infrastructure to hostile states, particularly Russia, which has been involved in sophisticated hacking campaigns. While there is no immediate evidence linking the Fastly disruption to a hostile state, the incident highlights the emerging dependencies and vulnerabilities in online systems, and questions whether those responsible for homeland security are adequately prepared to address them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MEXICO CITY, July 20 (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Tuesday described as ""shameful"" reports of purported government-ordered cyber spying several years ago that may have targeted him and his close allies and said his government did not spy on anyone.

The Guardian newspaper reported on Monday that at least 50 people close to Lopez Obrador, among others, were potentially targeted by the previous administration of President Enrique Peña Nieto after it purchased Pegasus spying software from Israel-based NSO Group. read more

The Mexican Attorney General's Office on Tuesday said it was planning to use some of the new information for its already-open investigation into spying on individuals using the Pegasus software.

""The (new) information is being incorporated into the already launched investigation,"" the office said in a statement.

The Guardian's reporting was based on what the newspaper and other media outlets have said was a leak of some 50,000 phone numbers that were selected for possible surveillance by NSO Group's government clients.

The list, first accessed by the French nonprofit journalist outlet Forbidden Stories and advocacy group Amnesty International, was shared with The Guardian and more than a dozen other news outlets.

Reuters has not been able to independently confirm the existence of the data leak or whether the contract was still active.

NSO Group rejected the reports of a data leak.

Pegasus was exclusively sold to government clients around the world by the Israeli company. In 2017, Citizen Lab, a group of researchers based at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs, said targets included the phones of journalists, human rights activists and experts investigating the 2014 disappearance of 43 Mexican students.

Lopez Obrador has accused his predecessor's government of being rife with corruption and abuses. He said on Tuesday that if the Pegasus contact was still active it must be canceled.

Mexico's defense ministry and attorney general's office were clients of NSO Group.

Thousands of Australians have been targeted in the bizarre 'Flubot' text message scam used by fraudsters to install malicious software on their phones and steal their personal information.

The typo-strewn texts tell the recipient they have a 'missed call' and to follow a link to hear a voicemail message.

Telstra has told its customers to ignore the messages - which lure users into downloading an app which then can harvest bank details from their phone.

To avoid getting conned, cyber security experts say there are a few things you can do.

The typo-strewn Flubot texts tell the recipient they have a 'missed call' and to follow a link to hear a voicemail message.

How to get rid of Flubot If you receive the message, don't click the link or call the number. If you have there are three ways to get the malware off you phone because simply deleting it may not be enough, 1. Get and IT specialist to wipe you phone 2. Download and antivirus software program 3. Do factory reset - but be warned this will also delete all you photos, files and apps. Advertisement

Firstly, do not click on the link or call the number. Second, delete the message and block the number.

It's also a good idea to report the text to the text to the Australian Communication and Media Authority's Scamwatch.

But if you have clicked on the link, don't open any other apps or websites and immediately contact your bank and report the incident to find out if you've lost any cash.

Just deleting the app will not necessarily get the sinister malware off your phone.

Delia Rickard, deputy chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said there are three ways to get rid of the unwanted software.

You can get an IT specialist to wipe the virus, download antivirus software or do a factory reset - but be warned this will also delete all you photos, files and apps.

'I cannot think of any time I've ever seen that many complaints on one scam in such a short period of time,' Delia Rickard, deputy chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Ms Rickard told news.com.au.

'It's a very sophisticated scam and potentially very dangerous. It can compromise people's bank accounts.

Australians have been warned about a bizarre 'Flubot' text message scam used by fraudsters to harvest their personal information (stock image)

One user shared a message about the scams she received from Telstra, who told her the texts were being sent at random to Australian phone numbers.

'As they're coming from legit devices across the globe they're more difficult to block than some other scams,' the message from a Telstra representative read.

'They're hard to block as they're coming from legitimate handsets and devices all over the world.

'Most popular anti-virus apps for Android will clean it up.'

Scamwatch is now receiving up to 500 Flubot reports a day, after it first appeared on August 4.

The malware which only infects Android phones has so far plucked $5579 from victims in Australia.

Hundreds of other Australians who received the texts took to Twitter to ask for help getting rid of them.

'Is anyone else getting a bunch of these messages lately?' one person wrote.

Among the typo-strewn messages she received was one that read 'you havr a zissed call. Callev lfft you a message' and 'you hate e mnssed ckll'.

'My guy's spelling is better,' another joked. 'I've had a few recently and I block each one but they keep coming.'

FluBot text messages have already been detected across Europe including in in the UK, Spain, Germany, and Poland.

The UK's National Cyber Security Centre has told users to factory reset their devices if they accidently download the malicious apps as the software cannot survive the phone's data being cleared.

Celebs arrived on the steps of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art for the 2021 Met Gala Monday evening donning extravagant, bold and flashy getups in the theme of In America: A Lexicon of Fashion. The annual gala, organized by Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour, raises funds for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute.

Vogue shared a livestream, co-hosted by actor and recording artist Keke Palmer and actor, writer and director Ilana Glazer. Palmer and Glazer greeted guests on the grand steps of the Met and offered commentary on the many unique ensembles. Here are some of the standout looks from the highly anticipated event that followed a year of pandemic-related lockdowns and cancelations.

Rihanna

The piece de resistance: Rihanna. The icon everyone was waiting for finally appeared at the show, and boy did she bring it. As the final celebrity to walk the red carpet, Rihanna closed out the night wearing a Balenciaga overcoat and matching hat.

Hailee Steinfeld

Not only did she feature in the Marvel's new Hawkeye trailer these past 24 hours, the singer-actor rocked up looking near unrecognizable at the Gala, and not just thanks to her Iris Van Herpen outfit.

Camila Cabello, Shawn Mendes

The stunning couple brought flair (and more bare skin) to proceedings, making their debut at the gala as a pair in style.

Kristen Stewart

The actor made waves a couple of weeks ago as Princess Diana in the trailer for the upcoming biopic Spencer. She hit the red carpet looking even more striking in her playful Chanel interpretation of the In America theme.

Lil Nas X

The rapper stole the show not once, not twice, but three times as he revealed multiple looks from Versace. Starting with a royal dress, he de-robed to a gold armor suit and then a sparkling body suit.

Frank Ocean

It's the weird we've all been waiting for. The singer wore a sleek velvety outfit, accessorized with... what can only be described as one of Shrek's kids. The green robot baby doll certainly shares his babysitter's hair.

""In America, we do set some trends, especially in music,"" Ocean told host Keke Palmer during his red carpet interview, offering the tiniest of explanations for his accessory.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

AOC wrapped herself in a literal fashion statement: a Brother Vellies, tuxedo-inspired dress adorned with the words: ""Tax the rich.""

Iman

Supermodel Iman Abdulmajid sailed in with a certified show-stopper, wearing a custom Harris Reed and Dolce Gabbana number.

Olivia Rodrigo

Eighteen-year-old singer-songwriter Olivia Rodrigo made her Met Gala debut a memorable one, pulling on a sheer lace Saint Laurent jumpsuit.

Simone Biles

The Olympic gymnast doesn't do things by halves. She does things by thirds -- wearing a three-in-one, 88-pound outfit, consisting of a skirt, mini-dress, black catsuit and a whole lot of Swarovski crystals.

Jennifer Lopez

JLo understood the assignment, tipping her hat to Ralph Lauren in a magnificent leather and feather harmonizing gown.

Megan Thee Stallion

The rapper brought '80s prom vibes with her classy pale pink number by Coach. As she raps in her Grammy-winning song Savage, ""classy, bougie, ratchet (yeah).""

Timothée Chalamet



The actor, one of this year's Met Gala co-chairs, showed up in a comfy-looking white ensemble featuring a satin tuxedo jacket, sweatpants and beige high-top Converse shoes.

Amanda Gorman

The poet, another event co-chair, arrived in a dazzling blue dress and matching strappy heels.

Billie Eilish

Singer-songwriter Billie Eilish, yet another co-chair, looked stunning in a flowy, Marilyn Monroe-esque Oscar de la Renta dress with a massive train.

Pete Davidson



Actor Pete Davidson channeled prep school vibes, wearing a thigh-length blazer... and a dark frock. With long socks to his mid calves and big boots, he pulls it off.

Naomi Osaka

Rounding out the list of this year's co-chairs, the tennis star arrived in an ensemble featuring an array of fun colors, textures and cuts.

Megan Rapinoe

The USWNT soccer star traded the soccer pitch for the red carpet -- wearing a redder than red suit to match. Her blue clutch left yet another statement, reading ""In gay we trust.""

Dan Levy

The Schitt's Creek star flaunted an eye-catching, puffy sleeve top with matching pants and studded black boots.

Leon Bridges

Singer-songwriter Leon Bridges paid homage to the American south with a blue fringe look and cowboy hat.

Maisie Williams

The Game of Thrones star graced the red (white, actually) carpet in a black dress with a long, sequined train and a partial cage hoop skirt.

Jon Snow, Rose Leslie

Everyone's favorite Game of Thrones golden couple on screen and off. Harington's white-topped suit let his wife's eye-catching mustard dress take center stage.

Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney



New York Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney's outfit gave a nod to the Equal Rights Amendment, a proposed amendment to the US Constitution asserting that someone's legal rights shouldn't be determined by their sex.",2023-12-04 17:50:43.810470+00:00,True,False,,,,"Met Gala 2021 red carpet: Standout outfits from Grimes, Rihanna, Lil Nas X and more - CNET",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a scathing email to hundreds of staff, an operator warned it is ‘only a matter of time until someone is seriously hurt or killed as a direct result’ of the chaotic system.

National Highways has introduced a new multi-million-pound programme called Charm in several of its regional control centres.

But the operator warned the technology is so riddled with problems that it is like ‘being forced to do our job blindfolded with both arms tied behind our back’.

In the blistering email, seen by the Mail, he complained of ‘unusable CCTV’ cameras. He said they have poor image quality, frequently freeze, and react slowly when operators try to find out what is happening.

A couple (pictured) have revealed their grandchild is still traumatised after their car broke down and crashed on one of the most lethal stretches of smart motorway.

In another accident, a former male model (pictured) who suffered devastating injuries when his motorbike lost power on a smart motorway wants the ‘murderous’ roads to be axed. Jack Gallowtree had to have emergency surgery to rebuild his leg and was told it would be amputated if his body rejected a skin graft from his arm.

In a scathing email to hundreds of staff, an operator warned it is ‘only a matter of time until someone is seriously hurt or killed as a direct result’ of the chaotic system. In the blistering email, seen by the Mail, he complained of ‘unusable CCTV’ cameras.

He also criticised the Dynac system – used to close lanes, set speed limits and warn motorists of breakdowns – for being ‘painfully slow’, further delaying measures to protect drivers.

In the email, titled ‘Something needs to be done’, sent to all staff and managers in his West Midlands region, he wrote: ‘Over the years we have complained and complained about the poor state of technology and yet nothing gets done.

‘There needs to be dramatic change in the way Highways manages its technology instead of the passive “let’s wait until it sets on fire or someone dies” approach we adopt now.’

He added he has ‘never seen [staff] morale as low or stress levels as high’. The operator monitors a stretch of smart motorway on the M6 near Birmingham, where eight-year-old Dev Naran was killed on a hard shoulder running as a live lane.

A recent undercover investigation by the Mail exposed a litany of failures at the heart of the roads agency tasked with keeping the public safe. We revealed that one in ten cameras was broken, misted-up or facing the wrong way during an audit on September 17.

Faulty, outdated computer hardware dating back to 2004 was in use and software went down several times in the six weeks that an undercover reporter spent working at one of six control centres. Boris Johnson ordered a ‘thorough’ investigation into the Mail’s revelations but the Department for Transport has refused to share the initial findings.

There were 53 deaths on smart motorways in the four years to 2019 – at least 18 blamed to some degree on the roads.

Last night, MPs and relatives of victims killed on the ‘death-trap’ roads branded the revelations ‘stomach churning’ and called for the immediate reinstatement of the hard shoulder.

Claire Mercer, who founded campaign group Smart Motorways Kill after her husband Jason, 44, died on a section of the M1 with no hard shoulder, accused National Highways of refusing to ‘put hands up and admit they’ve made a multi-billion pound mistake with taxpayers’ money and taxpayers’ lives’.

Labour transport spokesman Jim McMahon said: ‘Ministers must listen to the alarms being repeatedly sounded by insiders and step in before more families are devastated as a result of their inaction.’

A report on smart motorways by the Commons transport committee is expected within weeks. National Highways has been working on Charm – the Common Highways Agency Rijkswaterstaat Model – with the Dutch road authority for about a decade.

It is intended to help control room operators, who make decisions based on what they can see on camera to get drivers to safety.

National Highways boss Nick Harris said: ‘We are determined to do all we can to help drivers feel safe and be safer on all our roads which is why we have invested in modern traffic management technology to replace a system that was coming to the end of its natural lifespan...

‘We care deeply about the welfare of our staff and are working urgently to find solutions to each of the issues raised.’

A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘Road safety is our top priority and we take these reports very seriously. We expect National Highways to take appropriate actions where there are issues to address.’

Austrian firm Kapsch TrafficCom, which makes the Dynac system, said it does not comment on client projects due to confidentiality.

'Our grandson is still traumatised by crash' A couple have revealed their grandchild is still traumatised after their car broke down and crashed on one of the most lethal stretches of smart motorway. Peter and Marilyn Foyle and their grandchildren Harry and Georgina, now 14 and 15, were stranded for 90 minutes next to high-speed traffic after the car’s brakes failed on the M25. Mr Foyle had to crash into the back of a truck to stop the car. He said Harry was ‘deeply affected’ by the crash two years ago and is still ‘traumatised’ and ‘twitchy’. Following the terrifying ordeal, Mr Foyle called for immediate reinstatement of the hard shoulder. The architectural designer, 72, was driving his family to the Norfolk Broads for a holiday when their Chrysler Cruiser’s brakes failed. ‘I was panicking, thinking what the hell can I do here, there’s no time to think about it,’ he said. Mr Foyle put his hazard lights on and moved across into the inside lane, formerly the hard shoulder, before hitting the truck. Because there was no hard shoulder and no emergency bay nearby, they could not move the vehicles out of the live lane. The family waited behind the barrier for 90 minutes for National Highways to arrive. ‘We saw countless cars swerving to avoid the collision, there were lots of near misses,’ Mr Foyle said.

Getty Images

Apple has promised to fix a problem with its iPhone 13 that means that screen repairs performed by unofficial parties break its Face ID feature.

The model contains a chip that ""pairs"" a screen with a specific phone and requires special software tools to ""match"" a new one.

Repair firms have found that without those tools, the facial-identification security function no longer works.

Apple, whose repairers use the tools, says it will issue a software update.

The feature has been widely criticised by right-to-repair advocates, who suggest it was included to limit who could repair iPhones.

The issue was first reported by iFixit, a company specialising in tools, parts and tech repair guides.

It labelled the new link between screen replacements and Face ID as a ""dark day for fixers, both DIY and professional"".

Authorised repairs

The repair firm discovered that the new chip ensures that unless the replacement screen is ""matched"" to the phone's unique serial number, Face ID does not work.

The only known existing work-around for independent or do-it-yourself repairers involves delicate, laborious work to transplant the chip from the old screen to the replacement.

The procedure needs specialist equipment and training, which only a fraction of repair shops were capable of, according to iFixit.

Apple told news outlets, including The Verge and The Register, a solution would be made available in a future update but gave no date.

It is not clear whether the issue was a bug or - as some right-to-repair advocates argued - part of a wider move by Apple to restrict third-party repairs.

Apple has often been labelled one of the main opponents of right-to-repair legislation, reportedly arguing that allowing consumers to repair their own devices could lead to injury.

The company's co-founder, Steve Wozniak, who made the first Apple machines in a garage with Steve Jobs in the 1970s, has expressed support for the right-to-repair movement, saying Apple would not exist without the kind of tinkering repair enthusiasts are campaigning for.

Reacting to Apple's pledge, iFixit's Kevin Purdy wrote: ""It's a good day, if media attention and public pushback truly forced Apple's hand.""

But he also warned that it was ""an endless fight"".",2023-12-05 00:34:04.391474+00:00,True,True,True,,0.8981049386489911,Apple to fix iPhone 13 Face ID screen repair glitch - BBC.com,,"The software failure incident occurred with Apple's iPhone 13 model.

Apple's iPhone 13 came out in September, and it didn't take long for independent repair shops to find a big problem that would keep them from replacing the phone's screen. The iPhone maker reportedly will update the phone in the future to address this problem.

Tech repair site iFixit on Nov. 4 reported about an issue that prevents the iPhone 13 from using Face ID after the phone's screen has been replaced. Apple will reportedly send out an update soon to keep the iPhone feature working after the screen has been swapped, according to The Verge on Tuesday.

The source of the issue was a microcontroller that's paired to the iPhone 13 screen. When a screen gets switched, the small chip doesn't recognize the new screen and prevents Face ID from working. The only workaround was to remove the microcontroller from the old screen and solder it onto the new screen, which, due to its size, requires the use of a microscope.

Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Independent repair shops have been contending with Apple and other tech companies for years over accessibility on repairing products, an issue known as the right to repair.

After the screen was replaced, the Face ID feature of the iPhone 13 would no longer work. The cause of the failure was identified as a microcontroller paired to the iPhone 13 screen. When a new screen was installed, the microcontroller did not recognize it, resulting in the Face ID malfunction. The only solution was to remove the microcontroller from the old screen and solder it onto the new screen, a delicate process that required the use of a microscope.

The impact of the failure was that independent repair shops were unable to replace the iPhone 13 screen without compromising the Face ID functionality. This issue affected the repairability and usability of the device for customers who relied on third-party repair services. The responsible entity for the failure was Apple, as they designed the iPhone 13 with this flaw in the microcontroller. Apple was expected to release an update to address the problem and allow the Face ID feature to work after screen replacement.

This incident highlights the ongoing conflict between independent repair shops and tech companies like Apple over the right to repair. Independent repair shops have been advocating for greater accessibility in repairing products, while tech companies often restrict access to repairs and push for legislation that prevents third-party repairs. President Joe Biden's executive order in July aimed to support the right to repair, but challenges persist as third parties continue to fight against state legislation that limits their ability to repair devices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several dozen Activision Blizzard workers remain on strike, while management has not met their demands to reinstate 12 contractors at Activision Blizzard-owned developer Raven Software who were laid off in December. Most of the contractors are quality assurance testers working on various Call of Duty titles. Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter. ArrowRight In particular, Raven Software workers, tasked with checking for bugs and glitches in “Call of Duty: Warzone,” have stopped work for over seven weeks, multiple current employees told The Washington Post. Their absence comes at a time when numerous “Warzone” players, ranging from popular streamers to amateur gamers, have railed about the current state of that game on Reddit and social media, including citing game-breaking bugs, or issues that severely hamper gameplay.

“You can’t leave your game broken for a month. You’re going to lose a lot of players,” said James “JGOD” Godoy, a Call of Duty streamer, in a recent YouTube video. In the Dec. 29 video, he discussed the impact of Raven Software employees taking leave for the holidays while the game remained buggy.

The strike began Dec. 6, when over 60 Raven Software workers walked out in protest of their parent company laying off 12 of the studio’s quality assurance testers. It’s Activision Blizzard’s third work stoppage in six months since Activision Blizzard was sued in late July over sexual harassment and misconduct claims.

On Dec. 7, at least 200 Activision Blizzard workers across the company’s various studios walked out of work. As part of the current strike, which has no set end date according to those involved, workers have demanded that the company reverse the December layoffs and that all Raven quality assurance contractors receive full-time positions.

Activision Blizzard has not responded to employees’ demands, the employees said, although it sent out a letter to employees the same week the strike began to advise them “to consider the consequences” of signing union authorization cards. Unionization efforts are underway at the company, with employees pushing for a majority of signed cards so they can hold a vote on forming a union. In the meantime, over a dozen Minnesota-based workers were asked to work more closely with Raven developers on “Warzone.” Some had interpreted the request as Activision recruiting “scabs,” or strikebreakers, current employees told The Post.

“A lot of people felt upset that they were being asked to replace those who were let go,” said a current quality assurance tester for Activision in Minnesota, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.

Xbox and Lego have publicly said they are reconsidering their relationships with Activision Blizzard after allegations about a toxic corporate culture and sexual harassment came to light. Activision Blizzard did not respond when reached for comment on the companies’ announcements.

Activision Blizzard shared a statement with The Post on Jan. 5: “Activision is deeply committed to the well-being of all of our teams, including our QA workforce. Raven leadership has engaged in dialogue with its staff to hear concerns and explain the company’s overall investment in development resources.”

The statement also said Activision Blizzard would help any of the 12 laid-off workers that might need relocation assistance.

“The reason the games are buggier is definitely due to the strike,” said a second quality assurance tester on strike, who added that normally, massive bugs would be caught by quality assurance testers before making it to a live version of the game. “You can’t just lose some of your hardest working people and expect nothing to happen.”

Gamers playing “Call of Duty: Warzone” have noted that the game is filled with bugs that have diminished their enjoyment of playing it. Speaking to The Post, players also said they believe that cheaters are running rampant in game lobbies, despite the game introducing an anti-cheat software, which launched last year.

On Jan. 4, Activision sued EngineOwning, a Germany-based business that sells Call of Duty cheats, asking the court to stop the sale of software that provided players with in-game cheats.

Twitch streamers and YouTubers have recently posted a number of videos demonstrating their frustrations with glitches and the overall state of “Warzone.”

Some of the players who spoke with The Post said they were aware of the ongoing strike and voiced support for the workers, while others had not heard of the situation.

“It makes it even harder to support a game when Activision’s harassment issues toward women led to major walkout several months ago,” said Mondo Garvey, 25, who works for a construction company in Georgia. “And now with them laying off many of Raven’s employees and Raven workers going on strike, both companies are in shambles and the light at the end of the tunnel seems a lot dimmer.”

Shaylor Bemis, 28, a forklift driver and Call of Duty player from Ohio, said that while “Warzone” has had bugs since its March 2020 launch, the game has recently been plagued with more noticeable issues like an in-game cosmetic that turned players invisible, the game freezing when played on console systems and requiring players to restart, and guns that won’t work after players pick them up.

“It is very frustrating. I’m playing the game at my leisure. I play the game to blow off steam and stress and talk to some friends. I am not playing the game to be JGOD or Ice Man Isaac or trying to be part of FaZe [Clan],” said Bemis, referencing popular “Warzone” content creators. “It’s almost at the point where the game is unplayable, and that outlet for me will be taken away from me.”

Asked about the issues, a spokesperson for Activision Blizzard referred to the company’s previous statement about Raven Software and noted a pair of recent posts on the state of work on Call of Duty games. On Jan. 13, the official “Call of Duty” account tweeted that teams were working on bugs and glitches across “Vanguard,” “Warzone” and “Modern Warfare.” It said it was aware of the invisible skins in “Warzone.”

WASHINGTON, March 22 (Reuters) - Okta Inc (OKTA.O), whose authentication services are used by companies including Fedex Corp (FDX.N) and Moody's Corp (MCO.N) to provide access to their networks, said on Tuesday that it had been hit by hackers and that some customers may have been affected.

The scope of the breach is still unclear, but it could have major consequences because thousands of companies rely on San Francisco-based Okta to manage access to their networks and applications. read more

Chief Security Officer David Bradbury said in a blog post that a customer support engineer working for a third-party contractor had his computer accessed by the hackers for a five-day period in mid-January and that ""the potential impact to Okta customers is limited to the access that support engineers have.""

""There are no corrective actions that need to be taken by our customers,"" he said.

Nevertheless, Bradbury acknowledged that support engineers were able to help reset passwords and that some customers ""may have been impacted."" He said the company was in the process of identifying and contacting them.

The nature of that impact wasn't clear and Okta did not immediately respond to an email asking how many organizations were potentially affected or how that squared with Okta's advice that customers did not need to take corrective action.

The company's shares were down 1.3% at $167.14 in late afternoon trading, off earlier lows.

On its website, Okta describes itself as the ""identity provider for the internet"" and says it has more than 15,000 customers on its platform.

It competes with the likes of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), PingID, Duo, SecureAuth and IBM (IBM.N) to provide identity services such as single sign-on and multifactor authentication used to help users securely access online applications and websites.

'BE VERY VIGILANT'

Okta's statement follows the posting of a series of screenshots of Okta's internal communications by a group of ransom-seeking hackers known as Lapsus$ on their Telegram channel late on Monday.

In an accompanying message, the group said its focus was ""ONLY on Okta customers.""

Lapsus$ responded to Okta's statement on Tuesday by saying the company was trying to minimize the importance of the breach.

Some outside observers weren't impressed with Okta's explanation either.

""In my opinion, it looks like they're trying to downplay the attack as much as possible, going as far as directly contradicting themselves in their own statements,"" said Bill Demirkapi, an independent security researcher.

Dan Tentler, the founder of cybersecurity consultancy Phobos Group, earlier told Reuters that Okta customers should ""be very vigilant right now.""

There were already signs that Okta customers were taking action to revisit their security.

Web infrastructure company Cloudflare issued a detailed explanation of how it reacted to the Okta breach and saying the company did not believe it had been compromised as a result.

FedEx said in a statement that it too was investigating and ""we currently have no indication that our environment has been accessed or compromised."" Moody's did not return a message seeking comment.

Lapsus$ is a relatively new entrant to the crowded ransomware market but has already made waves with high-profile hacks and attention-seeking behavior.

The group compromised the websites of Portuguese media conglomerate Impresa earlier this year, tweeting the phrase ""Lapsus$ is now the new president of Portugal"" from one newspaper's Twitter accounts. The Impresa-owned media outlets described the hack as an assault on press freedom. read more

Last month, the group leaked proprietary information about U.S. chipmaker Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) to the Web. read more

More recently the group has purported to have leaked source code from several big tech firms, including Microsoft. In a blog post published Tuesday and devoted to Lapsus$, the software firm confirmed that one of its accounts had been compromised, ""gaining limited access.""

The hackers did not respond to a message left on their Telegram group chat seeking comment.

March 30 (Reuters) - The Lapsus$ gang of hackers claimed late Tuesday that it broke into software services firm Globant SA and stole 70 gigabytes of source code from the company's customers.

Globant confirmed a breach on Wednesday, saying that some of its code was accessed without authorization. The company said in a filing that it found no evidence that other areas of its infrastructure - or those of its clients - were affected. The company did not name Lapsus$ or identify who was responsible for the breach.

News of the hack sent Globant's shares tumbling about 10% to $248.92.

On its Telegram channel, Lapsus$ posted a screenshot of more than two dozen folders containing what it said was customer source code, including from well-known tech companies. The authenticity of the screenshot could not immediately be ascertained, but the group has previously stolen source code or other proprietary data from tech heavyweights including Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O).

Recently, the group claimed credit for having breached OktaInc(OKTA.O)after breaking into one of its contractors.

Lapsus$ has stunned and baffled cybersecurity experts in equal measure with its combination of juvenile antics and high-level access to some of the biggest companies in the world. The group uses a variety of methods, including bluffing, trickery, and bribes to steal passwords, Microsoft said in a blog post last week.

Following news of the Okta breach, British authorities announced that seven people - aged 16 to 21 - had been arrested at some unspecified point in the past and then later released. The authorities gave few other details but it was around that time that Lapsus$ told its fans ""a few of our members"" were going on holiday. read more

Neither the break - nor the arrests - appear to have curbed the group's appetite for leaks.

""We are officially back from a vacation,"" the group said as it announced the Globant breach.

April 19 (Reuters) - Silicon Valley's Wave Computing said on Tuesday it is launching designs for two new microprocessors this year using RISC-V architecture as it sunsets its once-popular MIPS architecture.

The move adds to growing momentum for RISC-V, an open-standard instruction set architecture (ISA) and emerging rival to proprietary architecture from Britain's Arm, the semiconductor technology firm owned by SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T).

RISC-V's nascent but growing popularity owes much to its free and open-standard nature. It is also in focus due to its potential to help China build up its own semiconductor industry as Chinese companies developing technology based on the architecture could be shielded from U.S. export controls.

Wave's MIPS architecture, developed in the lab of Stanford University professor John Hennessy, the current chairman of Alphabet Inc, is now over 35 years old.

It has fallen behind Arm's architecture, which rules in the mobile chip world, and x86 - initially developed by Intel Corp (INTC.O) - which dominated laptop and data center chips. After being owned by a string of companies, MIPS was bought by Wave which ended up in bankruptcy in 2020 and emerged from it early last year. read more

""In order for the company to continue to exist, it needed to find another way to be able to fight this ecosystem battle that it lost,"" Desi Banatao, who took over as CEO of Wave after its bankruptcy, told Reuters in an interview.

He added that the company has already inked a contract to supply one of the new processor designs to an automotive tech firm.

Sanjai Kohli, Wave's former CEO, said the MIPS and RISC-V instruction sets are close enough that the company was able to easily modify many of the MIPS processors it owns.

Intel has backed RISC-V, investing in the ecosystem as part of the launch of a $1 billion fund to support companies with disruptive technologies as it builds up its foundry business.

RISC-V also gained more attention after Nvidia Corp's (NVDA.O) bid to buy Arm heightened concern about the potential for the chipmaker to control Arm's architecture. The bid has since failed after being rejected by regulators.

Tesla recalled 129,960 vehicles this month to fix infotainment systems that may overheat before and during fast charging.

Tesla says it is resolving the flaw with an over-the-air software update, which refreshes software wirelessly like a smartphone app update, making the recall less burdensome for Tesla and affected owners. Tesla owners won’t need to take their vehicles to a service station.

Tesla has issued seven recalls this year for the 2022 Model 3 and six for the 2022 Model Y, all of which have been addressed with over-the-air software updates. Cars, especially electric vehicles, increasingly rely on computers to function, so software fixes are likely to become more common. The fixes may also be much less expensive to make compared to procuring and installing physical parts like new airbags or engine components.

The recall issued this month includes Tesla Model 3s and Model Ys from 2022 as well as Model Ss and Model Xs from 2021 and 2022 that are running certain versions of Tesla’s operating system. A computer chip in the infotainment system in these Teslas may not cool sufficiently, leading to slow processing or a restart. The infotainment system may lag or appear blank. Tesla owners rely on the infotainment system for many features, including navigation, music, heat and air conditioning, adjusting windshield wiper speed and viewing the back-up camera.

Tesla said in a public filing to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that it had identified 59 warranty claims and reports of the issue. It initially fixed the issue in some vehicles this January by replacing the computer chip in affected infotainment systems. By April it had developed a software update to address the issue.

Tesla said it id not aware of any crashes, injuries or deaths related this condition.

A single traditional recall, in which impacted owners must bring the vehicle in for service, could financially cripple an automaker, which has to pay for the labor and parts to complete fixes. General Motors spent $4.1 billion on recalls in 2015 for problems like faulty ignition switches.

Recall completion rates are much higher for software updates than traditional recalls, which is a safety benefit. Experts say a downside of over-the-air updates is they may encourage automakers to release features that haven’t been adequately tested and may be rough around the edges.

WASHINGTON, May 10 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) is recalling about 130,000 vehicles in the United States following an overheating issue that may cause the center touchscreen display to malfunction, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Tuesday.

The recall covers Tesla's S and X from the 2021 and 2022 model years and its 3 and Y from the 2022 model year. The electric vehicle maker will provide an over-the-air software update to resolve the issue, according to the NHTSA.

The infotainment system's CPU overheating could prevent the center screen from displaying images from the rearview camera, warning lights and other information, NHTSA said.

Tesla told NHTSA it was aware of 59 warranty claims and 59 field reports received since January that may be related to the issue but no reports of crashes or injuries related to the issue.

Tesla recalled 48,000 Model 3 Performance vehicles in the U.S. in April for an issue that may not display the speedometer when in ""Track Mode"". read more

Tesla has issued a number of recalls for camera-related issues. In March, Tesla recalled 947 vehicles in the United States because the rearview image may not immediately display when they begin to reverse.

In December, Tesla recalled 356,309 of its 2017-2020 Model 3 vehicles to address rearview camera issues.

The NHTSA said ""the rearview camera cable harness may be damaged by the opening and closing of the trunk lid, preventing the rearview camera image from displaying.""

Tesla has issued 11 recalls this year, tied with Chrysler parent Stellantis for fourth most in 2022.

Apple is facing a class action lawsuit in London today over claims it is 'throttling' the performance of its own handsets to get users to upgrade to the latest model.

The lawsuit, brought forward by consumer champion Justin Gutmann, alleges that Apple pushed users to download iOS updates that installed a 'throttling feature' on their iPhones, leading to unexpected shutdowns and poor device performance.

Mr Gutmann has filed a claim with the Competition Appeal Tribunal at Salisbury Square in London seeking damages of approximately £768 million for up to 25 million UK owners of a range of older iPhone models.

Apple has already had to pay a $113 million fine in the US relating to the 'throttling' issue, which dates back to 2017.

However, tech experts claim that Apple's performance management software really does help to preserve the battery life of older devices, and is not just a cynical trick to get customers to buy new phones.

'In fairness to Apple it does have an excellent track record on software updates and its phones often remain in use much longer than others,' Ben Wood, an analyst at CCS Insight, told Mail Online.

The tech giant has previously admitted that it uses software updates to limit performance on older iPhone models to stop them from shutting down, but claims it would never intentionally shorten the life of an Apple product.

Apple is facing a legal claim led by British consumer champion Justin Gutmann in the Competition Appeal Tribunal today. Pictured is one of the devices said to be affected by 'throttling' - iPhone 7 Plus (file photo)

Apple told MailOnline today: 'We have never – and would never – do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades.

'Our goal has always been to create products that our customers love, and making iPhones last as long as possible is an important part of that.'

Here, MailOnline answers the burning questions surrounding the controversial case, which could result in compensation of hundreds of pounds for affected consumers.

WHY IS THE CASE BEING BROUGHT FOWARD?

The lawsuit is being brought forward by consumer champion Justin Gutmann (pictured)

British campaigner Justin Gutmann is accusing the tech giant of slowing down the performance of iPhone handsets – a process known as 'throttling'.

His claim relates to the introduction of a 'power management tool' first released in January 2017 in software update iOS 10.2.1.

This tool was allegedly rolled out to slow down older iPhone models with ageing batteries, which may have struggled to run the latest iOS software.

Mr Gutmann alleges that information about this tool was not included in the software update download description at the time, nor that it would slow a user's device.

Overall, Apple misled users by pushing them to download software updates it said would improve the performance of some devices but, in fact, slowed them down, Gutmann argues.

Apple displayed 'exploitative and abusive behaviour in relation to the supply of iPhones and iOS updates', the lawsuit claims on its website.

'As a company in a dominant position, Apple has a responsibility to ensure its conduct does not subject its consumers to unfair trading conditions,' it says.

'This includes a responsibility not to engage in conduct which harms consumer welfare.

'Smartphones have become a significant part of people’s everyday lives, and it is imperative that consumers are treated fairly.'

UK residents who owned any of 10 different iPhone models at any point from September 13, 2016 will be able to claim compensation if the case is successful, including the iPhone 6 (pictured)

DOES APPLE REALLY SLOW DOWN iPHONES?

Back in December 2017, Apple admitted it does intentionally 'smooth out' the performance of its smartphones when a battery gets too old – almost a year after first doing so.

At the time, it said it used software updates to limit the performance of older iPhones with battery issues that are at risk of turning off suddenly if they work too hard.

Apple's statement was prompted by the results of a report from Geekbench that showed a pattern of degrading performance on iPhone 6 and iPhone 7 models with newer software updates.

Apple's statement said: 'Our goal is to deliver the best experience for customers, which includes overall performance and prolonging the life of their devices.

'Lithium-ion batteries become less capable of supplying peak current demands when in cold conditions, have a low battery charge or as they age over time, which can result in the device unexpectedly shutting down to protect its electronic components.

'Last year [in 2016] we released a feature for iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone SE to smooth out the instantaneous peaks only when needed to prevent the device from unexpectedly shutting down during these conditions.'

At the time, the firm came under fire for not being more transparent about the software update, or explaining to users when it happens, leading to an apology from the tech giant.

'Apple have repeatedly denied any intent but acknowledged the issue,' tech analyst Paolo Pescatore at PP Foresight told MailOnline.

'While it offered a replacement battery at a discounted rate, there might be calls for much more.'

However, the 2016 iOS update was not the only one to include performance management features. Apple has been accused of iPhone throttling until at least the iPhone 12, which was released in 2020.

Apple explains on its support site that, when the lithium-ion batteries in iPhones 'chemically age', their ability to deliver maximum instantaneous performance, or 'peak power', can decrease.

As a result, an older device with a chemically-aged battery is at risk of simply shutting down when it experiences a surge in power, as it is unable to cope.

Apple's power management tool aims to 'smooth out' these peaks by 'determining the capability of the battery to supply this power' and 'managing loads' in order to maintain operations.

Unfortunately for the user, this also slows the device down.

UK technology expert James Bore told Sky News on Thursday morning that Apple wanted to throttle the iPhones down so they would last longer, not to force users to buy new models.

'That's their claim, that does seem to be what the software update did, but they weren't particularly transparent about it,' Bore said.

Apple may not have intended to lack transparency, as 'tech companies tend to be not very good at communicating to owners of their devices', Bore said.

'It's not necessarily deliberately malicious, it's more they just don't consider the consumer when they're doing these clever little technical things,' he added.

WHICH IPHONE MODELS ARE INCLUDED IN THE CLAIM?

UK residents who owned any of 10 different iPhone models at any point from September 13, 2016 will be able to claim compensation if the case is successful.

The devices are iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone SE, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X.

All the above models were first released between 2014 and 2017, although thousands of iPhone owners in the UK could still be using them.

WHY IS THROTTLING SUCH AN ISSUE?

The argument is that, when iPhones slow down due to throttling, users are more likely to discard the affected device and buy a new one, further fuelling Apple's immense sales.

This results in an increase in electronic waste, which often ends up in landfill and seeps harmful chemicals into the ground.

Trevor Hutchings, a director at eco-friendly professional services firm Gemserv, said tech firms have a 'moral duty' to minimise their impact upon the planet.

'Shorter product lifespans mean consumers will change and upgrade at a faster frequency, likely leading to higher rates of product disposal and electrical waste,' he said.

'In recent years, the movement calling for a circular economy has only been growing, as consumers are becoming more concerned with the environmental impact of their products.'

WHAT DOES THE CASE MEAN FOR iPHONE OWNERS?

For now, UK owners of the affected devices don't have to do anything, apart perhaps from keeping an eye on how the case pans out.

The case is 'opt-out', meaning owners of the affected iPhone models will be automatically included in the claim, unless they choose to opt-out of the proceedings.

If Mr Gutmann's case is successful, they will have to provide their details at a later date to claim their portion of the damages.

Mr Gutmann is the proposed class representative – a person who acts on behalf of all members of the 'class', in this case, owners of the affected iPhones.

Compensation could be hundreds of pounds for each consumer if Mr Gutmann wins his court battle, although TechCrunch reports that it could only be £30.

HAS THIS REACHED THE COURTS BEFORE?

Back in November 2020, Apple agreed to pay a $113 million fine in the US relating to throttling performance on older iPhones to manage battery power.

The outcome divided the settlement between 33 US states, and ruled that Apple should issue documents to be transparent about how it throttles performance.

'Apple withheld information about their batteries that slowed down iPhone performance, all while passing it off as an update,' said former attorney general of California Xavier Becerra at the time.

'This type of behaviour hurts the pockets of consumers and limits their ability to make informed purchases.'

Apple also faced a lawsuit in Italy seeking €60 million in compensation for owners of iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6S and 6S Plus relating to the throttling issue.

HOW WILL THE UK TRIAL GO?

Law firm Charles Lyndon today issued the claim on behalf of Mr Gutmann, which is effectively the formal start of the litigation process.

The next stage is the scheduling of a case management conference, where a timetable to trial will be agreed.

It could be two to three years before the claim gets to trial and a judgement is passed, but the lawyers are hopeful that the parties will reach a settlement before then.

Pescatore at PP Foresight told MailOnline that he's not sure which way the case will go, when it does finally reach a conclusion.

'Ultimately it comes down to whether there was intent and successfully proving it,' Pescatore said.

'Whatever the ruling, most if not all consumer devices lose performance over time.'

It's also worth noting that, in previous trials, Apple hasn't been convicted of anything – so whether the firm has 'breached competition law by abusing its dominant position', as Gutmann puts it, remains to be seen.

'They [Apple] have not been convicted of anything, but they've settled several lawsuits in the US and various lawsuits around the EU,' Bore said.

Ben Wood, an analyst at CCS Insight, said the outcome of this case will 'come down the details'.

'If it can be proved Apple put measures in place that affected performance things will progress but it continues to maintain it did not meaningfully degrade service,' Wood told MailOnline.

'It is genuinely hard to tell - that's the problem with the case - it's so opaque.'",2023-12-06 03:00:44.538456+00:00,True,True,True,,0.8840017813406049,Does Apple NEED to slow down old iPhones?

A new report reveals that the effort, dubbed Project Titan and dating to 2014, has been plagued by a 'revolving door of leaders,' time wasted on sleek demos and a lack of commitment to mass production from CEO Tim Cook.

According to a report from The Information that's based on conversations with 20 company employees, Apple's Senior Vice President of Software Engineering Craig Federighi is 'particularly skeptical' of the project and has voiced his concerns to other senior executives at Apple.

Cook - who 'rarely visits' the project's offices in Santa Clara, California - has also been 'unwilling to commit to mass projection of a vehicle,' the report says, which has frustrated other leaders at the firm.

The Apple Car effort, dubbed Project Titan, has been beset by a range of issues, according to a new report in The Information based on interviews with 20 employees

Project Titan has at various times been led by Ian Goodfellow, Bob Mansfield, Doug Field and Kevin Lynch.

Earlier this year, one of Apple's test vehicles nearly struck a jogger while moving at about 15 miles per hour.

The Information reports that the car’s software at first identified the jogger as a 'stationary object' before recategorizing it as a 'stationary person' and then finally as a 'moving pedestrian.'

However, even with that change, the car 'only slightly adjusted its path.'

Earlier this year, one of Apple's test vehicles nearly struck a jogger while moving at about 15 miles per hour. Pictured above is a prototype of the Apple Car

Luckily, the backup human driver 'slammed the brakes at the last moment' which caused the vehicle to stop 'within a few feet' of the jogger.

If the human had not intervened, Apple’s tests indicated that the car 'would have almost certainly hit the jogger.'

After the incident, Apple reportedly temporarily grounded its fleet of test vehicles to probe what happened and did add the crosswalk to its maps database.

The car's current looks features 'four seats that face inward so passengers can talk to one another and a curved ceiling similar to the roof of a Volkswagen Beetle,' the report claims. Pictured above is a prototype of the car's interior based on Apple patents

The report of problems comes at a time when a survey in Consumer Reports reveals that 28 percent of Americans 'would not consider' buying an electric vehicle at all - whether its from Apple, Tesla and or one of the big automakers.

Consumer Reports states that the most common concerns cited among that segment were charging, range of travel and cost.

Apple's former chief design officer Jony Ive, who played a vital role in designing most of the company's most popular products, is reportedly consulting with the tech giant and has told the Apple Car team to 'lean into the weirdness' of its design and 'not try to hide the sensors.'

The car's current look features 'four seats that face inward so passengers can talk to one another and a curved ceiling similar to the roof of a Volkswagen Beetle,' reports The Information.

Apple Car designers are apparently experimenting with a trunk compartment that automatically rises and lowers to give owners 'easier access to the storage space.'

They've also considered a design that would allow passengers to 'lie flat and sleep in the vehicle,' the tech news site states.

The Apple Car team crafted several sleek demo videos for Cook and other high-level leaders - including a 40-mile trek through Montana filmed by drones - to demonstrate the project's progress.

However, the example also showed how engineers are 'wasting valuable time choreographing demonstrations' along known routes, proving the technology works in specific places but virtually nowhere else.

'If you spend enough money, you can get almost any fixed route to work,' former Uber self-driving vehicle engineer Arun Venkatadri explained to The Information. 'But what’s not shown is whether you can build your self-driving software in a scalable way and whether you can operate in a reasonably broad area.'

The Cupertino, California based company is reportedly still targeting 2025 for a potential launch of its self-driving vehicle.",2023-12-06 16:01:18.796341+00:00,True,True,True,,0.7852183555917672,"Apple Car project plagued by problems, including test vehicle almost hitting jogger - Daily Mail",Apple Car's Software Fails to Avoid Collision with Jogger,"The software failure incident occurred earlier this year during testing of Apple's self-driving vehicle.

130934,https://www.wired.com/story/starlink-internet-dish-hack/,2022-08-10 07:00:00+00:00,https://www.wired.com,,"Published on 2022-08-10 14:00:00+00:00.  Since 2018, Elon  Musk’s  Starlink  has  launched  more than 3,000 small satellites into orbit. This satellite network beams internet connections to hard-to-reach locations on Earth and has been a  vital source of connectivity during Russia’s war in Ukraine . Thousands more satellites are planned for launch as the  industry booms . Now, like any emerging technology, those satellite components are being hacked. Today, Lennert Wouters, a security researcher at the Belgian university KU Leuven, will reveal one of the first security breakdowns of Starlink’s user terminals, the satellite dishes (dubbed Dishy McFlatface) that are positioned on people’s homes and buildings. At the  Black Hat security conference  in Las Vegas, Wouters will detail how a series of hardware vulnerabilities allow attackers to access the Starlink system and run custom code on the devices. To access the satellite dish’s software, Wouters physically stripped down a dish he purchased and created a custom hacking tool that can be attached to the Starlink dish. The hacking tool, a custom circuit board known as a  modchip , uses off-the-shelf parts that cost around $25. Once attached to the Starlink dish, the homemade printed circuit board (PCB) is able to launch a  fault injection attack —temporarily shorting the system—to help bypass Starlink’s security protections. This “glitch” allows Wouters to get into previously locked parts of the Starlink system. Wouters is now  making his hacking tool open source on GitHub , including some of the details needed to launch the attack. “As an attacker, let’s say you wanted to attack the satellite itself,” Wouters explains, “You could try to build your own system that allows you to talk to the satellite, but that’s quite difficult. So if you want to attack the satellites, you would like to go through the user terminal as that likely makes your life easier.” The researcher notified Starlink of the flaws last year and the company  paid Wouters through its bug bounty scheme for identifying the vulnerabilities . Wouters says that while SpaceX has issued an update to make the attack harder (he changed the modchip in response), the underlying issue can’t be fixed unless the company creates a new version of the main chip. All existing user terminals are vulnerable, Wouters says. Starlink says it plans to release a “public update” following Wouters’ presentation at Black Hat this afternoon, but declined to share any details about that update with WIRED prior to publication. Starlink’s internet system is made up of three major parts. First,  there are the satellites  that move in low Earth orbit, around 340 miles above the surface, and beam down connections to the surface. The satellites communicate with two systems on Earth: gateways that send internet connections up to the satellites, and the Dishy McFlatface dishes people can buy. Wouters’ research focuses on these user terminals, which originally were  round, but newer models are rectangular . There have been  multiple   teardowns  of Starlink’s user terminals since the company started selling them. Engineers on YouTube have opened up their terminals, exposing their components and how they work. Others discuss the  technical specs on Reddit . However, Wouters, who previously  created hardware that can unlock a Tesla in 90 seconds , looked at the security of the terminal and its chips. “The user terminal was definitely designed by capable people,” Wouters says. His attacks against the user terminal involved multiple stages and technical measures before he finally created the now open source circuit board that can be used to glitch the dish. Broadly, the attack using the custom circuit board works by bypassing signature verification security checks, which look to prove that the system is launching correctly and hasn’t been tampered with. “We’re using this to accurately time when to inject the glitch,” Wouters says. Starting in May 2021, Wouters began testing the Starlink system, getting 268-Mbps download speeds and 49-Mbps upload speeds on his university building’s roof. Then it was time to open the device up. Using a combination of a “heat gun, prying tools, isopropyl alcohol, and a lot of patience,” he was able to remove the large metal cover from the dish and access its internal components. Photograph: Lennert Wouters Under the 59-cm diameter hood is a large PCB that houses a  system-on-chip , including a custom quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 processor, the architecture of which isn’t publicly documented, making it harder to hack. Among other items on the board are radio frequency equipment,  power over ethernet systems , and a GPS receiver. Opening up the dish allowed Wouters to  understand how it boots up and download its firmware . To design the modchip, Wouters scanned the Starlink dish and created the design to fit over the existing Starlink board. The modchip requires soldering to the existing Starlink PCB and connecting it using a few wires. The modchip itself is made up of a  Raspberry Pi microcontroller , flash storage, electronic switches, and a voltage regulator. When creating the user terminal’s board, Starlink engineers printed “Made on Earth by humans” across it. Wouters’ modchip reads: “Glitched on Earth by humans.” To get access to the dish’s software, Wouters used his custom system to bypass security protections by using the voltage fault injection attack. When the Starlink dish is turning on, it uses a series of different bootloader stages. Wouters’ attack runs the glitch against the first bootloader, known as the ROM bootloader, which is burned onto the system-on-chip and can’t be updated. The attack then deploys patched firmware on later bootloaders, which allows him to take control of the dish. “From a high-level view, there are two obvious things that you could try to attack: the signature verification or the hash verification,” Wouters says. The glitch works against the signature verification process. “Normally you want to avoid shorts,” he says. “In this case we do it on purpose.” Initially, Wouters attempted to glitch the chip at the end of its boot cycle—when the Linux operating system has fully loaded—but ultimately found it easier to cause the glitch at the start of the boot. This way was more reliable, Wouters says. To get the glitch to work, he says, he had to stop decoupling capacitors, which are used to smooth out the power supply, from operating. Essentially, the attack disables the decoupling capacitors, runs the glitch to bypass the security protections, and then enables the decoupling capacitors. This process allows the researcher to run a patched version of Starlink’s firmware during the boot cycle and ultimately allows access to its underlying systems. In response to the research, Wouters says, Starlink offered him researcher-level access to the device’s software, although he says he declined as he had gone too deep with the work and wanted to build the modchip. (During testing, he hung the modified dish out of this research lab’s window and used a plastic bag as a makeshift waterproofing system.) Starlink also issued a firmware update, Wouters says, that makes the attack harder, but not impossible, to execute. Anyone wanting to break into the dish in this way would have to put a lot of time and effort into doing so. While the attack isn’t as devastating as being able to take down satellite systems or connectivity, Wouters says it can be used to learn more about how the Starlink network operates. “What I am working on now is communicating with the backend servers,” Wouters explains. Despite making the details of the modchip available for download on Github, Wouters does not have any plans to sell finished modchips, nor is he providing people with patched user terminal firmware or the exact details of the glitch he used. As an increasing amount of satellites are launched—Amazon, OneWeb, Boeing, Telesat, and SpaceX are creating their own constellations—their security will come under greater scrutiny. In addition to providing homes with internet connections, the systems can also help to get ships online, and play a role in critical infrastructure. Malicious hackers have already shown that satellite internet systems are a target. As Russian troops invaded Ukraine, alleged Russian military hackers targeted the  Via-Sat satellite system ,  deploying wiper malware  that bricked people’s routers and knocked them offline. Around 30,000 internet connections in Europe were disrupted, including more than 5,000 wind turbines. “I think it’s important to assess how secure these systems are because they are critical infrastructure,” Wouters says. “I don’t think it's very far-fetched that certain people would try to do this type of attack because it is quite easy to get access to a dish like this.” Update 5 pm ET August 10, 2022:  After Wouters’ conference talk, Starlink  published a six-page PDF explaining how it secures its systems . “We find the attack to be technically impressive, and is the first attack of its kind that we are aware of in our system,” the paper says. “We expect attackers with invasive physical access to be able to take malicious actions on behalf of a single Starlink kit using its identity, so we rely on the design principle of ‘least privilege’ to constrain the effects in the broader system.” Starlink reiterates that the attack needs physical access to a user terminal and emphasizes its secure boot system, which was compromised by the glitching process, is only impacted on that one device. Wider parts of the overall Starlink system are not impacted. “Normal Starlink users do not need to be worried about this attack affecting them, or take any action in response,” Starlink says.",2023-12-06 18:42:36.863182+00:00,True,True,True,,0.8111451290581563,The Hacking of Starlink Terminals Has Begun - WIRED,"""Security Breakdown: Hacking Starlink's User Terminals Reveals Vulnerabilities""","The software failure incident occurred when security researcher Lennert Wouters revealed a series of hardware vulnerabilities in Starlink's user terminals, specifically the satellite dishes known as Dishy McFlatface.

Desde 2018,  Starlink de ELON Musk  ha puesto en órbita más de 3.000 pequeños satélites. Esta red de satélites transmite conexiones de Internet a lugares de difícil acceso en la Tierra y ha sido una fuente vital de conectividad durante la guerra de Rusia en Ucrania.  Está previsto que se lancen  miles de satélites  más a medida que la industria crece. Ahora, como cualquier tecnología emergente, esos componentes de los satélites están siendo  pirateados . Hoy, Lennert Wouters, investigador de seguridad de la universidad belga KU Leuven, revelará uno de los primeros fallos de seguridad de las terminales de usuario de Starlink, las antenas parabólicas (apodadas Dishy McFlatface) que se colocan en las casas y edificios de los ciudadanos.  En la conferencia de seguridad Black Hat de Las Vegas, Wouters detallará cómo una serie de vulnerabilidades de hardware permiten a los atacantes  acceder al sistema Starlink  y ejecutar código personalizado en los dispositivos. Para tener acceso al software de la antena parabólica, Wouters desmontó físicamente una antena que compró y creó una herramienta de hackeo personalizada que se puede acoplar a  la antena Starlink .  Esta herramienta, una placa de circuito personalizada conocida como modchip, utiliza piezas estándar que  cuestan unos 25 dólares . Una vez acoplada a la antena de Starlink, la placa de circuito impreso casera es capaz de lanzar un ataque de inyección de fallos que pone el sistema en cortocircuito de forma temporal y ayuda a eludir las protecciones de seguridad de Starlink. Este ""fallo"" permite a Wouters entrar a partes del sistema Starlink previamente bloqueadas. Wouters ha publicado su herramienta de pirateo en GitHub, incluyendo algunos de los detalles necesarios para lanzar el ataque. ""Como atacante, digamos que quieres llegar al propio satélite"", explica Wouters, ""podrías intentar construir tu propio sistema que te permita hablar con el satélite, pero eso es bastante difícil. Así que si quieres atacar los satélites, deberías hacerlo a través de la terminal del usuario, ya que eso te facilita la vida."" El investigador notificó los fallos a Starlink  el año pasado y la empresa pagó a Wouters a través de su programa de recompensas por errores por identificar las vulnerabilidades. Wouters afirma que, aunque SpaceX ha emitido una actualización para dificultar el ataque (él cambió el modchip en respuesta), el problema subyacente no puede solucionarse a menos que la empresa cree una nueva versión del chip principal. Todas las terminales de usuario existentes son vulnerables, afirma Wouters. Starlink dice que planea lanzar una ""actualización pública"" tras la presentación de Wouters en Black Hat esta tarde, pero declinó compartir cualquier detalle sobre esa actualización con WIRED antes de su publicación. El sistema de Internet de Starlink  se compone de tres partes principales. En primer lugar, están los satélites que se mueven en la órbita baja de la Tierra, a unas 340 millas por encima de la superficie, y emiten conexiones a esta última.  Los satélites  se comunican con dos sistemas en la Tierra: las puertas de enlace que envían las conexiones de Internet a los satélites y los platos Dishy McFlatface que la gente puede comprar. La investigación de Wouters se centra en estas terminales de usuario, que originalmente eran redondas, pero los modelos más recientes son rectangulares. Desde que la empresa comenzó a vender sus  terminales de usuario , se han realizado múltiples desmontajes de las mismas. Ingenieros en YouTube han abierto sus terminales, exponiendo sus componentes y su funcionamiento. Otros discuten las especificaciones técnicas en Reddit.  Sin embargo, Wouters, que anteriormente creó un hardware capaz de desbloquear un Tesla en 90 segundos, se interesó por la seguridad de la terminal y sus chips. ""La terminal de usuario fue definitivamente diseñada por gente capaz"", dice Wouters. Sus ataques contra la terminal de usuario implicaron múltiples etapas y medidas técnicas antes de que finalmente creara la placa de circuito, ahora de código abierto, que puede usarse para estropear el plato.  En términos generales, el ataque que utiliza la placa de circuito personalizada funciona eludiendo las comprobaciones de seguridad de verificación de firmas, que buscan probar que el sistema se está lanzando correctamente y no ha sido manipulado. ""Utilizamos esto para calcular con precisión el momento de inyectar el fallo"", dice Wouters. A partir de mayo de 2021, Wouters empezó a probar  el sistema Starlink , obteniendo velocidades de descarga de 268 Mbps y de subida de 49 Mbps en el tejado de su edificio universitario. Posteriormente, llegó el momento de abrir el dispositivo. Con una combinación de ""pistola de calor, herramientas para hacer palanca, alcohol isopropílico y mucha paciencia"", pudo retirar la gran cubierta metálica de la antena y tener acceso a sus componentes internos.

 Photograph: Lennert Wouters Bajo la cubierta de 59 cm de diámetro hay una gran placa de circuito impreso que alberga un sistema en chip, incluido un procesador ARM Cortex-A53 de cuatro núcleos personalizado, cuya arquitectura no está documentada públicamente, lo que dificulta su pirateo.  Entre otros elementos de la placa se encuentran equipos de radiofrecuencia, sistemas de alimentación por Ethernet y un receptor GPS. Abrir la antena parabólica permitió a Wouters entender cómo arranca y descargar su firmware. Para diseñar el  modchip , Wouters escaneó el plato del Starlink y creó el esquema para que encajara en la placa existente del Starlink. El modchip requiere que se suelde a la placa existente de Starlink y se conecte mediante unos pocos cables.  El modchip en sí está compuesto por un microcontrolador Raspberry Pi, almacenamiento flash, interruptores electrónicos y un regulador de voltaje. Al crear la placa de la terminal de usuario, los ingenieros de Starlink imprimieron en ella ""Made on Earth by humans"", es decir, ""Hecho en la Tierra por humanos"". El modchip de Wouters dice: ""Glitched on Earth by humans"" lo que se traduciría en español como ""Hecho fallar en la Tierra por humanos. Para conseguir acceso al software de la antena, Wouters utilizó su sistema personalizado para saltarse las protecciones de seguridad mediante el ataque de inyección de fallos de tensión.  Cuando la antena parabólica Starlink se enciende , utiliza una serie de etapas diferentes del cargador de arranque.  El ataque de Wouters ejecuta el fallo contra el primer gestor de arranque, conocido como gestor de arranque ROM, que está grabado en el sistema en chip y no puede actualizarse. A continuación, el ataque despliega el firmware parcheado en los cargadores de arranque posteriores, lo que le permite tomar el control del plato. ""Desde un punto de vista de alto nivel, hay dos cosas obvias que se podrían intentar atacar: la verificación de la firma o la verificación del hash"", dice Wouters. El fallo funciona contra el proceso de verificación de la firma. ""Normalmente lo que se quiere es evitar los cortos"", dice. ""En este caso lo hacemos a propósito"". Al principio, Wouters intentó provocar un fallo en el chip al final de su ciclo de arranque -cuando el sistema operativo Linux se ha cargado por completo-, pero al final descubrió que era más fácil provocar el fallo al principio del arranque.  Esta forma era más fiable, dice Wouters. Para conseguir que el fallo funcione, dice, tuvo que impedir que funcionaran los condensadores de desacoplamiento, que se utilizan para suavizar la fuente de alimentación. Básicamente, el ataque desactiva los condensadores de desacoplamiento, ejecuta el fallo para eludir las protecciones de seguridad y luego activa los condensadores de desacoplamiento. Este proceso permite al investigador ejecutar una versión parcheada del firmware de Starlink durante el ciclo de arranque y, en última instancia,  permite el acceso a sus sistemas subyacentes .  En respuesta a la investigación, dice Wouters, Starlink le ofreció acceso a nivel de investigador al software del dispositivo, aunque dice que lo rechazó porque había profundizado demasiado en el trabajo y quería construir el modchip. (Durante las pruebas, colgó el plato modificado de la ventana de este laboratorio de investigación y utilizó una bolsa de plástico como sistema de impermeabilización improvisado).

Cualquiera que quiera entrar en la antena parabólica de esta manera tendría que dedicar mucho tiempo y esfuerzo a hacerlo. Aunque el ataque no es tan devastador como el de poder derribar los sistemas de satélites o la conectividad, Wouters dice que puede utilizarse para aprender más sobre el  funcionamiento de la red Starlink . ""En lo que estoy trabajando ahora es en la comunicación con los servidores backend"", explica Wouters. A pesar de que los detalles del modchip están disponibles para su descarga en Github, Wouters no tiene planes de vender modchips terminados, ni está proporcionando a la gente el firmware de la terminal de usuario parcheado o los detalles exactos del fallo que utilizó. A medida que se lanzan cada vez más satélites –Amazon, OneWeb, Boeing, Telesat y SpaceX están creando sus propias constelaciones–, su seguridad será objeto de un mayor escrutinio. Además de proporcionar conexiones a Internet en los hogares, los sistemas también pueden ayudar a que los barcos estén en línea y desempeñar un papel en las infraestructuras críticas.  Los hackers malintencionados ya han demostrado que  los sistemas de Internet por satélite son un objetivo . Cuando las tropas rusas invadieron Ucrania, presuntos piratas informáticos militares rusos atacaron el sistema de satélites Via-Sat, desplegando un programa malicioso que bloqueaba los routers de los usuarios y los dejaba fuera de servicio. Se interrumpieron unas 30.000 conexiones a Internet en Europa, incluidas más de 5.000 turbinas eólicas. ""Creo que es importante evaluar la seguridad de estos sistemas porque son infraestructuras críticas"", afirma Wouters. ""No creo que sea muy descabellado que ciertas personas intenten hacer este tipo de ataque porque es bastante fácil conseguir acceso a un plato como este."" Actualización 5 pm ET 10 de agosto de 2022: Tras la charla de Wouters en la conferencia, Starlink publicó un documento PDF de seis páginas en el que explica cómo asegura sus sistemas. ""Consideramos que el ataque es técnicamente impresionante, y es el primer ataque de este tipo que conocemos en nuestro sistema"", dice el documento. ""Esperamos que los atacantes con acceso físico invasivo puedan llevar a cabo acciones maliciosas en nombre de un solo kit de Starlink utilizando su identidad, por lo que nos basamos en el principio de diseño de ""mínimo privilegio"" para restringir los efectos en el sistema más amplio."" Starlink reitera que el ataque necesita acceso físico a una terminal de usuario y subraya que su sistema de arranque seguro, que se vio comprometido por el  proceso de glitching  (fallo), solo se ve afectado en ese único dispositivo. Las partes más amplias del sistema Starlink en general no se ven impactadas. ""Los usuarios normales de Starlink no tienen que preocuparse de que este ataque les afecte, ni tomar ninguna medida en respuesta"", afirma Starlink.

The incident was revealed by security researcher Lennert Wouters at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas. Wouters discovered a series of hardware vulnerabilities in the user terminals, which allowed attackers to access the Starlink system and execute custom code on the devices. To gain access to the software of the user terminal, Wouters physically disassembled a purchased antenna and created a custom hacking tool called a modchip, which could be attached to the Starlink antenna. This modchip, costing around $25, could launch a glitch injection attack that temporarily short-circuited the system and bypassed Starlink's security protections. Wouters notified Starlink of the vulnerabilities, and the company paid him through its bug bounty program. However, the underlying issue cannot be fully resolved without creating a new version of the main chip, making all existing user terminals vulnerable. The impact of the failure is that attackers could gain unauthorized access to parts of the Starlink system. The responsible entity for the failure is Starlink, and the impacted entity is the user terminals of the Starlink network. Starlink has released a firmware update to make the attack more difficult but not impossible to execute.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many Instagram users woke up Monday to a notification that their accounts had been suspended for violating community guidelines. Within a couple of hours, some reported that their access had been restored, with the company behind the app saying access was back to normal by evening. Unable to post Halloween photos on the app, users sought answers on Twitter and other platforms, with many of them saying they had no idea what the violations cited by Instagram could have been. Meta, the app’s parent company, confirmed that users in different parts of the world had issues accessing their accounts, but a spokesperson said in a statement that those problems had been resolved. “Earlier today, a bug caused some Instagram users to have issues accessing their Instagram accounts,” said the statement. “This led to a small number of accounts seeing a temporary change in how many people follow them. We resolved the issue as quickly as possible for everyone who was impacted, and we apologize for the inconvenience.” The company did not say how many people were affected by the suspensions. Many noted that this issue was distinct from past outages on the photo-sharing platform, as they were notified that their accounts had been suspended rather than just being unable to access them. Users who received the notification were given the option to appeal the decision within 30 days. “If we can’t confirm your account, it will be permanently disabled,” the notice read. When trying to follow the appeal process, users were logged out of their accounts and unable to log back in, they reported on Twitter and other sites. Some said that glitches were affecting their usage of the app before Monday morning, but that the issues were not as widespread. The website  DownDetector.com , where users can report outages, showed that reports of an issue started around 9 a.m. Eastern. Those reports were beginning to decline sharply by noon. By late morning, many users started to report that things were working normally again and that their photos and access had been restored. Social media outages like this one usually do not last for long. Last month, Instagram said that  a confirmed outage  had been resolved within an hour. Meta’s stock price fell about 5 percent in early trading on Monday, after opening at $98.21. The company has had a turbulent year: By Friday’s close, Meta’s stock price had plunged more than 70 percent this year. In July, the social media company reported its  first revenue decline  since going public, and it has continued to post slowing growth. This month, it reported that  its profits had slumped  52 percent from a year earlier. Chris Perry, a real estate agent in Arlington, Va., noticed that he was losing dozens of followers by the minute on Monday morning, before his account was suspended. His Instagram account, which had about 45,000 followers, helps him connect with potential buyers and sellers. “It’s a big concern of mine, not being able to get back in,” he said. “If it’s not up right now, it’s not a huge deal. I can wait. If it’s permanently deleted, that’s a big part of my business.” For Beth Bourdon, a public defender in Orlando, Fla., Instagram is for fun, not work. The issues with her app started Sunday night when the app continuously crashed as she tried to scroll through her feed, she said, but her account was never suspended. “I have a lot of friends who have small children, and they live for Halloween,” she said. “They go all out, so I know they want to be posting their Halloween photos.”",2023-12-07 02:55:18.637543+00:00,True,True,True,,0.7719248860751237,Instagram Users Report Widespread Account Suspensions - The New York Times,Instagram Users Experience Account Suspensions and Access Issues,"On October 31, many Instagram users experienced a software failure incident where their accounts were suspended for violating community guidelines. The failure occurred in the morning, with some users reporting that their access was restored within a couple of hours, and the company behind the app, Meta, stating that access was back to normal by evening. The cause of the failure was identified as a bug that caused issues accessing Instagram accounts, resulting in a temporary change in the number of followers for a small number of accounts. The impact of the failure was that users were unable to post Halloween photos on the app, leading to frustration and confusion among users who claimed to have no knowledge of any violations. Meta confirmed that users worldwide experienced issues accessing their accounts but stated that the problems had been resolved. The responsible entity for the failure was Meta, the parent company of Instagram. The impacted entities were the Instagram users who had their accounts suspended or experienced difficulties accessing the app. The company did not disclose the exact number of people affected by the suspensions. Users who received the suspension notification were given the option to appeal the decision within 30 days, but some reported being logged out of their accounts and unable to log back in when attempting to follow the appeal process. The incident was distinct from past outages on the platform, as users were specifically notified about their account suspensions. The failure was resolved relatively quickly, with reports of the issue declining sharply by noon. However, Meta's stock price fell about 5 percent in early trading on Monday, reflecting the company's ongoing challenges and declining performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
